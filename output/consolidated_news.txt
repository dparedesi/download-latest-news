It’s getting frothy out there. Pick any stock market metric, whether it’s the Nasdaq’s closing price or a more technical measure like the Shiller P/E ratio, and the number will look unusually large. Throw in crazy AI valuations, for privately held startups and publicly traded stocks alike, and what we’re seeing looks a lot like a bubble. Perhaps this time is different. But note that phrase served as the ironic title of an acclaimed 2011 book by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff—a work whose subtitle is “Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.” In any case, if you’re one of many looking at your swollen portfolio with a mix of glee and dread, it may be time to consider a rebalancing act. This section of this year’s Investor’s Guide offers some ideas on how to go about that. We offer tips on how to play defense in the current stock market (spoiler: Candymakers are a sweet bet for sour times). We also devote some space to stocks that might be best held at arm’s length; whatever these companies’ ultimate fates might be, these aren’t the times or the prices at which to be a buyer. And for optimists, we have a preview of some buzzy rumored IPOs coming next year. Choppy markets can make for attractively priced debuts: Perhaps you will find the next UPS, which went public right before the dotcom bust, or Visa, which listed on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis. We’ll also weigh in on gold and Bitcoin. In the wake of Warren Buffett penning his final letter to investors, it feels fitting to say his most famous adage applies like never before: Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy. Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at investment manager Research Affiliates, says a good first step is to diversify beyond stocks to TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) or commodities like gold. When it comes to equities, Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard chief economist in the Americas, advises embracing value stocks—stocks whose prices are low relative to their earnings. Not all value stocks are created equal, of course. Here are some categories and names to consider that are likely to fare well in an economic downturn (prices are as of market close Nov. 13): Consumer plays:Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at financial services firm Morningstar, says companies that produce staples like food and cleaning products are less correlated with broader economic trends. Stocks in this “consumer defensive” category include Colgate-Palmolive (CL, $79), which makes toothpaste and other household items. In addition to selling goods that consumers will buy in any economy, “Colgate is unique in the fact that they are very globally diversified,” says Erin Lash, Morningstar’s director of consumer equity research. Lash is also a fan of Mondelez International (MDLZ, $57), a candy, food, and beverage company, in part because it derives more than 70% of its revenue outside North America. “Confectionery in particular remains an affordable indulgence for consumers,” she says. You’ve still got your health: Stocks in the health care sector, another recession-resistant industry, are another way to buffer your portfolio from market shocks. David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, likes HCA Healthcare (HCA,$473), which operates around 190 hospitals and 150 other health care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. “Demand for health care is going up like crazy,” says Trainer, adding that this trend, combined with HCA’s more-than-decade-long history of notching consistent profits, makes it a strong, undervalued play. Energy hogs: Once-boring energy stocks became buzzy owing to the AI sector’s insatiable need for power, which has produced record-high electricity demand. But even if the AI boom goes south, energy businesses aren’t as risky as they seem, says Masturzo of Research Affiliates, because overall demand for power remains strong. MPLX (MPLX, $52) is an Ohio company that owns oil pipelines and fuel transportation facilities. “As long as people need energy, they’re going to transport it,” says Trainer. Its price/earnings ratio in mid-November was 11, much lower than the average of 31 among the S&P 500. “Anti-AI”: Arnott, the strategist at Morningstar, says that if investors are worried about the overvaluation of AI stocks, they could look to Buffett. The business legend’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B, $513) is a conglomerate that Arnott describes as “an anti-AI play.” The firm derives much of its income from sectors like energy, railroads, and insurance—services that will be very much in demand even if the AI bull market turns bearish. In a frothy market all stocks are risky— and that’s doubly true for companies that may have soared too high in the recent boom, or that face harsh economic headwinds. Here are candidates to avoid, at least until business conditions revive or their prices come down to earth. Circle (CRCL, $82) went public this summer in one of the most successful IPOs in history. That was then; now, the crypto firm is struggling to hold its value as interest rates, which directly impact Circle’s stablecoin revenue, are poised to decline. Circle’s share price is facing further pressure from the end of a lockup period for employee stock sales, and its ongoing struggle to control expenses. Tesla (TSLA, $402) is on pace to record its worst year of profits since 2021. It’s also headed for a second straight year of shrinking sales in its car business. Still, the stock is trading at all-time highs. Why? Investors are likely betting that CEO Elon Musk will deliver on moonshot promises of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Maybe Musk is worth his recently won $1 trillion pay package, but the likelihood of Tesla turbocharging its car sales in 2026 to match its current valuation seems out of this world. Bears are sounding the alarm over inflated valuations for AI companies, and there’s perhaps no purer publicly traded AI play than CoreWeave (CRWV, $78). The company operates data centers across the U.S. and sells computing capacity to Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. CoreWeave “is the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble,” Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm shorting the company’s stock, wrote in September. The core of CoreWeave’s risk lies with its liabilities: To finance the construction of its data centers, it has incurred billions in debt and taken on hefty lease obligations. Can it juice its revenue to outpace that tsunami of liabilities? Two words: prediction markets. That describes the business of upstarts Kalshi and Polymarket, which made their names offering odds on U.S. politics, but are fast expanding to other categories—including sports betting. This has left DraftKings (DKNG, $30) one of the most popular online sportsbooks, on its back foot. “Analysts are downplaying the tectonic shift that we believe is occurring in the sports betting market and DKNG,” wrote short-seller Spruce Point Capital Management in an October report. After President Trump unveiled a sweeping set of tariffs on what he termed “Liberation Day,” swaths of companies saw their share prices tumble. Many have since recovered, but Deere (DE, $473), the venerable maker of John Deere agricultural and construction machinery, has continued to struggle. For the first three quarters of 2025, the company reported year-over-year decreases in net sales, and it’s been wrestling with the impact as trade wars play havoc with American farm exports—not a good sign for tractor sales. If 2024 amounted to an IPO drought, the 2025 IPO market has been more like a persistent drizzle. That, more or less, bodes well for an even steadier stream of public debuts in 2026. “The IPO market is not closed,” says Merritt Hummer, partner at Bain Capital Ventures. “It’s just curated, and I think that’ll continue to be the case. That cautious but decidedly positive sentiment is a bigger deal than it may appear on the surface. After IPOs soared in 2021 amid near-zero interest rates and stay-athome investor mania, the past few years have been muted. According to Dealogic, there were 1,010 IPOs in the U.S. in 2021, including marquee brands like Rivian, Bumble, and Robinhood. Over the next three years, however, the market collectively mustered only 546 more public offerings, with just a handful of big names in the mix. Then came 2025, which through Q3 has seen more than 300 U.S. IPOs, including blockbuster debuts from CoreWeave, Circle, and Figma. It was a decent but not great year in the view of market watchers, but they’re bullish on 2026. “Everything is set up for a much more positive year, because multiples are still pretty strong for tech in the public markets,” says Kyle Stanford, PitchBook director of research for U.S. venture capital. Geopolitical instability has fueled post-2021 stagnation in the IPO market, as have higher interest rates. But that stagnation means the bench for potential venture-backed IPOs runs deep with companies that have been biding their time. There are obvious giants waiting in the 2026 wings, the most notable of which is Databricks, a cloud platform for AI and data analytics valued north of $100 billion. Long discussed as an inevitable public company, Databricks has a key advantage that will be essential for any company looking to go public at a premium: an AI angle. “Anything with an AI story is getting a premium,” says Mary D’Onofrio, Crosslink Capital partner. “Databricks, for example, had $4 billion of run rate revenue, and AI products were providing $1 billion of it…Anything that can touch on AI, which tugs on the purse strings and the willingness to buy of customers, suggests ongoing growth.” This is equally true for other names attracting IPO buzz, including Canva, which in 2024 acquired Leonardo.ai, leveraging the startup to launch new AI-flavored products. (The successful IPO of fellow design unicorn Figma is being cited as evidence of Canva’s readiness.) There’s also Deel, an HR platform valued at around $17 billion, which makes its AI case by investing in automation. (Notably, none of these companies are making the kinds of massive infrastructure investments that have some industry watchers worried about an AI bubble.) All this AI talk evokes the question: What about OpenAI? It’s not impossible, but most watchers think OpenAI won’t take the leap into public markets until 2027. Meanwhile, the most underrated IPO story of 2026 could very well be fintech. This year saw the likes of Chime, Klarna, and Circle go public, and unicorns like Plaid and Rapyd are rumored to be waiting in the wings. “Chime and Circle showed that fintechs with clear profitability paths can perform well, and that gave the market confidence again,” says Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures general partner and early Chime investor. “‘Profitability’ wasn’t a word anyone was using in the 2012 to 2019 runup. And now it’s the most important term we talk about and are thinking about for next year.” Others tech firms to watch out for: cybersecurity company 1Password, fleet management software provider Motive, and fitness tracking app Strava. But a word of caution: A host of factors could rain on this parade. PitchBook’s Stanford doesn’t expect a recession, but says that if one materialized it would stymie the IPO pipeline. And then there are the unpredictable dynamics of the AI boom. David Chen, Morgan Stanley’s head of global technology investment banking, thinks much of the current hype will create serious long-term value. But not every AI-fueled rise will live up to that hype. “It kind of reminds me of when I started in this industry in 1999,” Chen says. “If expectations aren’t met…you’ll have a lessening of interest temporarily, which always happens in tech. There are always winners and losers.” Gold has always been the ultimate safe haven in times of economic trouble. But these days, a growing number of market watchers say investors should opt instead for digital gold—a popular nickname for Bitcoin. Owing to the rules governing its creation, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation, which is a big reason fans say it should be treated as a permanent store of value, just like the famous yellow metal. “It’s the only place you can go that’s independent from government inflation,” says David Pakman, a managing partner at the venture capital firm CoinFund. “It’s the kind of asset you’ll hand down to your kids—you must own it.” It’s clear many people agree with Pakman, based on Bitcoin hitting a record-high price of around $125,000 in October, and seeing its market cap swell to over $2 trillion. The World Gold Council and prominent goldbugs, who used to ignore Bitcoin, now regularly denounce it, recognizing competition. Does this mean gold’s days as the safest of assets are numbered? Hardly. As of November, Bitcoin’s market cap was only around 7% of the total value of all above-ground gold. What’s more, gold has been on an unprecedented tear this year, hitting $3,000 an ounce for the first time in March, and $4,000 less than six months later. The eye-popping runs have left goldbugs and Bitcoin believers ecstatic. But Mike McGlone, a senior commodities strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence, says he is experiencing a different emotion. He describes himself as “frightened” by the soaring prices of numerous commodities, including gold, and believes a major correction is coming that could see the price of the yellow metal drop 25% or more. McGlone says he is especially skeptical of Bitcoin’s trajectory after attending an investing summit in Naples where he witnessed people stand and clap whenever someone mentioned the cryptocurrency. “This is classic peak market stuff,” he warned, predicting that Bitcoin could fall to around $50,000 in the coming year. Indeed, there are signs that the crypto rally, fueled by the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and the Trump administration’s favorable regulatory policies, is running out of gas. In early November, the currency dipped below the $100,000 mark and has since floated closer to that level than to its all-time high. Pakman, though, is taking the long view. “It’s just the greatest asset ever created,” he said. “Bitcoin has performed better than any asset over 11 of the last 14 years. —Jeff John Roberts This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “What to buy, and not buy, in 2026.”

Title: Long-delayed jobs report to show hiring amid wobbly economy

The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as "stagflation." Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. “We have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. “You can’t address both of those at once.” Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. "A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it," Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: September jobs report arrives today, almost seven weeks behind schedule

Scott Horsley Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday shows employers added 119,000 jobs in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Hiring picked up in the early fall after a lackluster summer. An overdue report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.4%. The report was released almost seven weeks behind schedule due to the government shutdown. And because the shutdown also delayed data-gathering, there won't be another jobs report until mid-December. While the newly released information is a bit stale, it may offer some clues about the pace of hiring and firing this fall. The report paints a mixed picture of the job market. Hiring was strongest in health care and hospitality in September, while factories and warehouses cut jobs. Downsizing in the federal government also continued during the month, though state and local governments continued to add jobs. Revised data shows job growth in July and August was even weaker than initially reported, with 33,000 fewer jobs added during those months. Loading... For months now, employers have neither added many new workers nor handed out a lot of pink slips. But Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller worries that's about to change. Waller says his conversations with business leaders show the job market is close to stalling. "Four to six weeks ago, we were still in this kind of no-hire/no-fire mode," Waller told a group of economists in London this week. Business leaders, he said, are "starting to talk about layoffs. They're starting to plan for them in the future." Amazon recently announced 14,000 job cuts, and Verizon is cutting 15,000 workers. Waller wants the Fed to cut interest rates again when policymakers meet next month, to boost demand and prop up the labor market. But minutes from the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, show considerable disagreement among central bank policymakers. Many members of the Fed's rate-setting committee suggested it would be appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the rest of the year, noting that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. That's partly due to President Trump's tariffs. And some Fed policymakers think the import taxes will continue to put upward pressure on goods prices well into next year. Ordinarily, the Fed would have jobs numbers for October and November in hand before its next meeting. But because of the government shutdown, those reports won't be released until after the meeting, and some of the October data won't come out at all. It's also uncertain when or if the October inflation report will be published. That said, Waller insists he and his colleagues are not flying blind. They've been listening to businesses like Target and McDonald's that say many of their customers are cautious with their spending right now. That could put more of a squeeze on the job market. "You just go talk with firms that work with low- and middle-income households, they'll tell you point-blank, they're just not coming in the door," Waller said. "And then these firms are not going to be hiring." While government data on consumer spending has also been held up by the shutdown, anecdotal reports suggest only the wealthiest families are spending freely these days, buoyed in part by the gains in their stock portfolios. The unemployment rate is driven by two forces: the number of jobs employers want to fill and the number of workers available to fill those jobs. The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has limited the number of foreign-born workers, at the same time many native-born baby boomers are retiring. Some analysts argue that the limited supply of workers is largely responsible for the slowdown in hiring. Waller worries that the slowdown is driven more by a declining need for workers, which could result in higher unemployment in the months to come. "There's definitely a reduction of supply," he said. "But to me that is masking the reduction in demand, and that's what I'm concerned about." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: The September jobs report is finally here

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The United States added 119,000 jobs in September, a stronger-than-expected figure and a sign that the economy was adding jobs at a healthy clip before government shutdown. But the details of the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a more mixed picture, that of a labor market that has recently begun to look wobblier amid high-profile layoff announcements from a host of blue-chip companies. September's employment gains were concentrated in health care, food and drinking establishments, and social assistance. Manufacturing shed 6,000 jobs, continuing a trend in a sector the Trump administration has touted as a key target of its economic policies. Transportation and warehousing also lost 25,300 jobs. The unemployment rate climbed from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, though the pickup was due in part to an increase in the labor force, which the BLS said gained 450,000 new potential workers. The pace of wage growth slowed. Thursday’s report was originally supposed to be released Oct. 3, but it was shelved because of the government shutdown. Jobs data collected for October will be released Dec. 16 as part of the full report covering November, the BLS said Wednesday. The absence of official economic reports over the past six weeks has made it difficult to accurately assess the current state of the jobs market. But data from private and alternative sources has painted a worrisome portrait amid signs of softening consumption among many households and stubborn price increases. Over the past few weeks, Amazon, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Paramount, Target and UPS have announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Their ranks were joined Thursday by Verizon, which announced the start of layoffs affecting 13,000, according to an internal memo. About 39,000 workers received layoff notices in October, according to data tracked by the Cleveland Federal Reserve — a number last seen in May and before that only during times of crisis. A separate report released this month by the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas counted 153,000 job cuts announced in October, though some analysts give less weight to its data over methodology questions. Whatever the exact total, those who do find themselves without work are now experiencing an average unemployment spell of 24.5 weeks — nearly six months. That’s the worst reading since November 2017. Tiffany Price, South Florida general manager for Job News USA, a job listings service, said many companies face budget cuts and have effectively frozen hiring. And what companies are still hiring are offering lower compensation rates that more experienced workers may have trouble accepting. The number of employers who attended a recent Job News jobs fair at Amerant Bank Arena in Broward County, Florida, was nearly half the figure of a year ago, while attendance among workers held steady at about 2,000 potential applicants, Price said. Still, many organizations report difficulties finding qualified workers, she said. On both the employer and the employee sides, a “post and pray” job application strategy has taken hold that leads to worse outcomes for both, she said. More successful outcomes on both fronts have come from local relationships and face-to-face outreach. A bright spot has been local government, Price said — something that is reflected in the national data, which shows employment in local government roles has continuously expanded since the Covid-19 pandemic recovery set in. “It’s a weird market,” she said. Questions about the health of the labor market now dominate discussions about whether the Federal Reserve should continue to cut interest rates. On Monday, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said a December cut was needed to stem further job-market deterioration. “My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order,” he said. In his speech last month announcing a 0.25% rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was more circumspect, saying it appeared that the jobs market was weakening only gradually and signaling he was not ready to guarantee a December rate cut was inevitable. The Fed’s divisions were laid bare in meeting notes released Wednesday from the October rate-setting meeting that showed a sharp split among policymakers about the risk that lower rates would spur already-elevated inflation by making it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow money. “Most participants noted that, against a backdrop of elevated inflation readings and a very gradual cooling of labor market conditions, further” interest-rate cuts “could add to the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched,” the notes said. So far, many economic analysts have been reluctant to call it a full-blown jobs crisis, pointing to data from state-level claims for unemployment that remain subdued and recent reports from the payrolls processor ADP showing a slight rebound in new hires. “Fears of a renewed labour market downturn, amid reports of mass layoffs at several large firms, are not reflected in still-muted jobless claims or the pick-up in hiring in the ADP private payrolls report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for Capital Economics research group, wrote in a note published last week.

Title: Can We Blame Private Equity for Everything?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Did PE firms make the world worse? Or was it something else? The Blackstone Group offices in New York, 2013. The 2010s were, among other things, the decade of private equity. A segment of the finance sector long shrouded in myth and controversy, private equity is at its core a straightforward business: A firm raises money from clients (such as pension funds) and uses it to buy businesses and other assets (such as real estate), usually adding a large chunk of borrowed money to the mix. The PE firm aims to increase the value of the acquired assets and then sell them at a profit. Clients receive whatever is left of any gains after the deduction of fees, which include a share of those gains. The “equity” in private equity refers to the ownership stakes the PE firm takes, while the “private” means these investments are held outside of public stock markets. Though private equity has been around since the 1970s, its growth went into overdrive after the global financial crisis of 2007–09. Until that point, banks—especially investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan—had been the most powerful players in the world of global finance. Yet banks were widely held responsible for the crisis, leading regulators in the United States and a host of other countries to clip their wings. As big banks became “more heavily regulated and scrutinized,” Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2019, private-equity firms like Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR moved decisively out of their shadow. “Almost everything that’s happened since 2008 has tilted in [private equity’s] favor. Low interest rates to finance deals? Check. A friendly political climate? Check. A long line of clients? Check…. Private equity managers,” the Bloomberg Businessweek report concluded, “won the financial crisis.” By 2021, the average Blackstone employee was earning more than $2 million per annum, and the firm’s CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, had a net worth of nearly $40 billion. It is thus little wonder that recent years have seen a slew of books aimed at coming to grips with the PE phenomenon, with more in the works. The latest addition to the crop is Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream, by the journalist Megan Greenwell. Although there have been notable exceptions—including two memoirs about working in private equity, from very different perspectives—most of the recent books, as Greenwell points out, have been attempts to understand and evaluate PE in broad terms as an economic and social phenomenon: what it is, how it operates, its size and structure, and so forth. Such books focus, Greenwell observes, “on the macro level: the number of companies that shutter, the number of jobs that disappear, the number of dollars that are won and lost.” In Bad Company, Greenwell takes a different tack, shifting the lens from the macro to the micro level. “When we talk about how private equity affects communities,” she writes, “we’re really talking about how it affects people, the individuals who have no choice but to rely on firms for their jobs, their homes, their essential services.” And so she presents us with the stories of four individuals whose lives have been impacted by the PE takeover of, respectively, a retail chain, a small-town hospital, a newspaper company, and an apartment complex. Through these profiles, Greenwell paints a picture of a decidedly unedifying phenomenon: of PE firms swooping into local communities, buying local assets, and radically degrading the conditions of people’s lives. But does this analytical shift from the macro to the micro scale ultimately pay dividends for our understanding of the nature and effects of the PE business? There are, of course, always different ways to tell a story, and the story of private equity is no different in this respect. However, when the mode of analysis is the exploration of individual lives, as it is in Bad Company, it’s important to think closely about what those lives can and cannot meaningfully tell us about the wider phenomenon under consideration. When books that explore broad social phenomena through individuals’ life stories work particularly well, there is usually an intimate and necessary connection between the lives in question and the phenomenon to which the author is relating them. The sociologist Matthew Desmond’s 2016 book Evicted is a good example. In it, Desmond follows eight individuals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they and their households go through the process of eviction at the hands of their landlords. Focused on these individual lives, Evicted also manages to serve as an exemplary study of the wider phenomenon of eviction because of two key characteristics of the latter. The first is that eviction is precisely something that happens to individuals. The second is that, for tenants, involuntary eviction is a unique hardship: While housing insecurity can take many forms and can be suffered in all sorts of ways, nothing else matches the experience of being evicted from one’s home against one’s wishes. Then what about working for a company or living in an apartment that is taken over by a PE firm? Is that, too, a unique type of experience? Consider Greenwell’s four profiles: Liz is laid off without severance from Toys “R” Us when its PE owners close its last 200 stores; Roger, a doctor, sees his beloved hospital in rural Wyoming stripped of resources and crucial services after a PE takeover; Natalia is a reporter at a local newspaper whose staff is slashed after PE ownership takes hold, diminishing the paper’s capacity to report and hence the community’s access to local news; and Loren moves from public rental housing into a PE-owned apartment complex where mold and infestations of mice and roaches are not allowed to stand in the way of rent hikes. Is there a necessary and intimate connection between these types of personal experience and the phenomenon of private equity, one that makes them “PE experiences” per se? Greenwell maintains that there is indeed such a necessary and intimate connection. For her, the experience of working at a PE-owned business or living in PE-owned housing is special inasmuch as the PE ownership and operation of such assets is itself special. As she sees it, it all comes down to profitability—that is, what ostensibly connects the individuals whose lives Greenwell chronicles, thus making theirs a shared experience as opposed to four unrelated ordeals, is their subjection to a distinctive profit calculus. But is that calculus unique to PE? Early in Bad Company, Greenwell cites the American economist Milton Friedman and his influential 1970 essay about the role of the corporation in American capitalism. “The social responsibility of business,” Friedman famously insisted, “is to increase its profits.” And that, he added, is its sole responsibility. Friedman’s injunction has been endlessly debated in the decades since. For Greenwell, its particular relevance is that private equity, and only private equity, has, in her view, followed the Friedmanite philosophy to the letter. Friedman, she says, “set the stage for the rise of private equity.” To explain how PE differs from other forms of owning and operating assets like businesses and real estate, Greenwell offers the following take: “The definition of success is loftier in the private equity world: not just making profits, but maximizing them.” “Merely making a profit was no longer enough,” she writes, for instance, of what changed when Apollo Global Management took over LifePoint Health and its chain of rural hospitals across the US, including Roger’s hospital in Wyoming. “Now the goal,” à la Friedman, “was to maximize shareholder value.” In positing this Manichaean distinction between “normal” capitalist businesses that “just make” profits and PE firms that seek to “maximize” them, Greenwell establishes a pro forma narrative of what happens when private equity comes to town: “When the only worth of a local grocery store, a newspaper, or a hospital is the short-term profits it can generate, the company becomes little more than a mine awaiting extraction.” Which, crucially, is not what that company had previously been: “Businesses that were once pillars of a society founder and crumble,” Greenwell writes. By this way of thinking, other capitalist businesses, unlike PE firms, do take seriously “responsibilities” other than profit-making. Far be it from me to downplay private equity’s profiteering, but this argument clearly rests on a questionable supposition: Is it genuinely credible to cast non-PE firms as less obsessed with profit? Try telling BlackRock, State Street, or the other major shareholders in America’s 4,000-odd public companies that the goal of those companies is something besides maximizing shareholder value. Greenwell’s own reporting demonstrably belies the distinction her book posits. Take Gannett, the media group that owned the local newspaper employing Natalia when it was acquired by Fortress Investment Group in 2019. Was Gannett formerly a pillar of local society, whose modus operandi was rudely upended by the PE barbarians? Hardly. “Well before private equity was in the local media game,” Greenwell informs us, “Gannett was creating [PE] firms’ playbooks for them: ruthlessly consolidate, centralize as much as possible, boost shareholder value at all costs—even when the cost was the journalism, the company’s ostensible raison d’être.” Gannett, it turns out, was already an archetype of Friedmanite capitalism, red in tooth and claw. The same kind of contradiction befalls the other case studies here. The more Greenwell tells us about the businesses that private equity came in and subsumed, the less like pillars of society and paragons of business ethics they appear to be. Rather than substantiating her thesis of a sui generis role for private equity in destroying civil society and the American dream, what Greenwell actually reaffirms is a kind of bog-standard point about how business is done in America. Because, of course, it wasn’t just private equity that took Friedman’s gospel to heart. Capital at large did. None of this is to say that there aren’t important differences between PE firms and other owners and managers of businesses and real estate—that things do not change when PE comes to town. Very often they do. Nor is it to say that the individual stories that Greenwell spotlights in Bad Company have nothing to tell us about the corrosive effects of a corporate and financial world single-mindedly beholden to maximizing shareholder value. But as insights, in and of themselves, into the nature of the PE phenomenon? Not so much. In reality, much the same book, containing much the same litany of woes, could be written about the effects on individuals and communities of adventures in the capitalist profit imperative that have nothing to do with private equity whatsoever. Indeed, over the years, many such books already have been written, from Michael Harrington’s The Other America to Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed and Jefferson Cowie’s Stayin’ Alive. Does a private-equity takeover often result in dire outcomes for workers and tenants? To be sure. But it is far from being unique in that. It’s for good reason that the other recent books seeking to comprehend and appraise the PE phenomenon are primarily pitched at the macro level. Private equity is a quintessentially macro-scale enterprise; instructive analysis of it cannot eschew that analytical scale. Boiled down to its essence, private equity is an investment phenomenon. Yet if investment is the term we use to refer to the myriad ways in which actors holding surplus capital are connected to the actors who put that capital to work, then private equity represents above all a distinctive way of configuring that connectivity. Arguably, its cardinal characteristic—evident to all institutional stakeholders—is that the investment explicitly does not have an open time horizon. Allocating client capital via funds with fixed lifespans, and returning the capital (ideally with a profit) to clients upon the funds’ termination, PE managers buy assets—and this cannot be emphasized enough—in order to later sell them. Whether the acquired businesses or rental homes or whatever else it may be are held for one year, three, or five, everything that the PE manager does with those assets while they are under its control is done with a view specifically to maximize the price at exit. If there is a single thing that one must grasp in order to understand private equity, this is it. Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers Jeet Heer Mie Hoejris Dahl Evan Robins Bad Company, to be clear, does not eschew macro-scale analysis altogether. Greenwell has plenty to say about the role of debt financing in PE buyouts; the relationship of PE firms to their clients in the institutional-investor community; the significance of PE tax breaks, which generations of policymakers have refused to abolish; and much else besides. Ultimately, it’s a question of balance. The examination of how a handful of individuals experience life at the sharp end of private equity’s pillaging can, without doubt, add texture and color to our understanding, helping to humanize the impacts of an industry often discussed in dry financial terms. But it’s questionable whether it can do more than that, not least because those experiences are not categorically different from the experiences of individuals ensnared by capitalist ravages more generally. Private equity, to my mind at least, has always internalized a fundamental tension concerning its ability to exit its investments, which is typically achieved either through a sale to another private buyer (whether a strategic trade buyer or another financial investor) or through an IPO on the stock market. Why, one wonders, are other investors willing to pay the top-dollar exit price that private equity, by its very nature, demands? If—as is generally assumed to be the case—the PE firm has itself exhausted all the obvious opportunities for value enhancement and extraction during its period of ownership, why buy what’s left? If all the fruit has been plucked and the PE firm has achieved its signature goal of exiting at maximum value, is not the only way for the subsequent value of those assets, in fact, down? Over the past couple of years, it seems that the penny may have finally dropped. PE firms are widely struggling to exit their investments profitably and return cash to their clients. In mounting desperation, they have turned to launching so-called “continuation vehicles”—essentially, mechanisms for extending fund life and protecting the book value of marginal assets—but clients, smelling a rat, have been reluctant to back them. A vicious circle seems to be setting in: Required to hold on to assets for longer and longer periods, private equity is, as the financial journalist Katie Martin observes, “squeezing more of the juice out of them, and leaving little for public market investors,” thereby making it even harder still to achieve an exit. The upshot is that the PE sector is now sitting on some $3 trillion worth of unsellable assets. And as clients have become increasingly frustrated with the difficulties of achieving and realizing gains from PE investments, they have responded by beginning to allocate less capital to the sector. Private-equity fundraising slid to a seven-year low in the last year, and with a record number of firms chasing this dwindling pot of capital, many have resorted to “unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash,” not least markedly lower fees. No wonder that PE firms have meanwhile been lobbying furiously for access to new sources of capital, with America’s individual retirement savings—hitherto off-limits for PE managers—considered the holy grail, and President Trump seemingly willing to oblige. In short, the PE sector, and its profitability prospects, are under pressure as perhaps never before, making it possible to ask a question that until recently would have been deemed outlandish: Has private equity had its moment in the sun? If so, and for reasons that Bad Company and all the other recent PE books make abundantly clear, few will feel any sympathy.

November 20, 2025 04:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Janitorial Services Market With Impact Analysis of US Tariffs (2025 Edition)" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.One of the most significant drivers of the janitorial services market is the heightened awareness of health and hygiene, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic shifted the way businesses, institutions, and even households perceive cleanliness. As organizations adopt stricter cleaning protocols to mitigate the spread of infections, the demand for professional janitorial services has surged. Regular deep cleaning, sanitation, and disinfection have become standard practices in many industries, particularly healthcare, hospitality, and retail.Moreover, due to expansion of commercial spaces such as offices, malls, and entertainment centres has also contributed to the growth of the janitorial services market. As new buildings and facilities are constructed, there is a corresponding demand for ongoing cleaning and maintenance services. This demand is particularly prominent in rapidly urbanizing regions, where commercial real estate and industrial activities are increasing. In developing economies, urbanization and industrialization have led to the rise of new buildings, fuelling the need for more comprehensive cleaning services.Another factor driving the janitorial market is the growing preference for eco-friendly and sustainable cleaning solutions. As environmental concerns become more prevalent, companies are increasingly opting for green cleaning practices that minimize the use of harmful chemicals and reduce environmental impact. Janitorial service providers that offer green cleaning options are seeing greater demand, especially from environmentally conscious organizations and sectors like education and healthcare. Furthermore, innovations in cleaning technologies are also playing a significant role in the expansion of the janitorial services market. The adoption of advanced cleaning equipment, such as automated floor scrubbers, high-efficiency vacuums, and even robotic cleaners, has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of janitorial services. These technological tools enable faster and more thorough cleaning, which is particularly important for large-scale facilities such as airports, shopping centres, and hospitals.The janitorial services market in North America is mature, with steady demand driven by the healthcare, corporate, and retail sectors. The United States is the largest contributor to the region's market, where businesses continue to outsource cleaning services to improve efficiency. Additionally, the growing adoption of green cleaning solutions and the demand for specialized cleaning services in healthcare facilities are contributing to the market's growth. Moreover, in Asia-Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth in the janitorial services market, driven by increasing urbanization, industrialization, and the expansion of commercial spaces. Countries such as China, India, and Japan are key contributors to the market's growth, where the rise of new infrastructure and commercial projects creates a strong demand for cleaning services. The hospitality and retail sectors, in particular, are expanding in this region, further fuelling the demand for janitorial services.Outsourcing facility management, including janitorial services, allows businesses to cut costs significantly. By outsourcing, companies avoid the expense of hiring, training, and managing in-house cleaning staff, purchasing cleaning equipment, and maintaining inventory of supplies. Specialized janitorial service providers can offer more cost-effective solutions due to economies of scale, better pricing on cleaning materials, and expertise in optimizing cleaning schedules. This makes outsourcing an attractive option, especially for large businesses and organizations with extensive facilities.Companies are increasingly focusing on their core competencies and leaving non-core functions such as cleaning and facility management to professionals. By outsourcing janitorial services, organizations can allocate more resources and time to improving their primary operations, such as customer service, production, or business development. This is particularly appealing to businesses in industries like healthcare, education, and hospitality, where the main focus is on delivering quality services to customers, patients, or students.Janitorial service providers bring specialized knowledge, expertise, and the latest technologies to facility management. With access to modern cleaning methods, eco-friendly products, and advanced equipment such as robotic cleaners and automated systems, outsourced providers can deliver high-quality services that meet industry standards. This allows businesses to benefit from cutting-edge cleaning solutions without the need to invest in expensive equipment or train staff.

Title: Bitcoin just hit a critical point: analysts split between $85K crash and $250K surge

While Bitcoin price has recovered from the low of $88,540 hit on November 19, the question is whether it will hit a higher high than the $93,403 registered on November 18. Some analysts believe BTC is preparing for a deeper slide, while others insist a powerful rebound is already forming beneath the surface. At press time, BTC price was around $92,237 and already showing signs of exhaustion, which would spell doom since it formed a lower low on November 19, which is a bearish sign. At $92,237, Bitcoin (BTC) is reeling from a bruising stretch that has erased more than $33,000 from its value in under two months. Notably, today’s uptick follows a pause in ETF outflows and a rebound in tech stocks, driven by Nvidia’s stronger-than-expected earnings. While the market remains on edge as macro uncertainty and shifting liquidity conditions continue to pressure risk assets, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson remains one of the strongest voices calling for a major rebound. During CNBC’s Squawk Box show on Tuesday, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s recent losses reflect broader macro distortions, including tariff tensions, recession risks, and uneven regulatory signals. Hoskinson believes these forces will ease in the coming months. He expects BTC to recover sharply and potentially hit $250,000 within the next year, projecting that institutional adoption and large-scale tokenisation will redefine market cycles. Michael Saylor shares a similar level of confidence, viewing the current downturn as typical of Bitcoin’s long-term behaviour. The MicroStrategy executive says the company is built to withstand extreme drawdowns, calling his position “indestructible” in a recent interview with Fox Business. ₿etter than Ever. Today I was the warm-up act for @natbrunell as we both talked Bitcoin with @cvpayne. You’ll want to hear what she had to say. pic.twitter.com/vDaFceyeza — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 18, 2025 Notably, Saylor has continued to buy BTC even as volatility increases, reinforcing his view that deep corrections are part of the broader path toward higher valuations. ETF activity has also become a pivotal factor. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF posted a record $523 million daily loss on November 18 following a streak of outflows across the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. The Bitcoin ETFs outflow seems to have stabilised, with IBIT seeing $60M worth of inflows on November 19. Analysts warn that sustained inflows will be essential if Bitcoin hopes to avoid a retest of this week’s lows. Not all signals point upward. Some traders see a real chance BTC could break below key support levels near $90,000. If the market fails to hold this support, prediction platforms indicate rising expectations of a drop toward $87,000. ETF outflows totalling more than $3 billion this month highlight lingering caution, and many retail participants remain hesitant after weeks of drawdowns. Macro conditions remain complicated. Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have faded, while recession concerns are resurfacing due to weak jobs data and ongoing trade friction. These pressures have limited upside momentum even as Nvidia’s tech rally briefly boosted risk appetite. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to trade like a high-beta asset tied closely to broader market sentiment, and the next few days may determine whether buyers regain control or whether sellers will test new lows.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Pop In 2025 or 2026? How About Nvidia and OpenAI?

Time Published: 2025-11-20T08:06:24Z

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Title: Will the AI Bubble Pop In 2025 or 2026? How About Nvidia and OpenAI?

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Nearly two years after the inception of the Bitcoin ETF sector in the United States, these funds are currently grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by mounting concerns regarding a potential bear market in the coming months. This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest increased its exposure to crypto-related stocks on Wednesday, purchasing Bullish, Circle Internet Group and BitMine Immersion Technologies across multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as crypto stocks slid deeper into the red. According to ARK’s daily trade disclosure, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) bought 48,011 shares of Bullish, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) added 92,670 shares. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) made the largest move of the group, purchasing 322,917 shares of Bullish, bringing the total to $16.8 million. ARK followed this with sizeable buys of Circle, the company behind the USDC (USDC) stablecoin. ARKF picked up 22,327 shares and ARKW snapped up 43,174, while ARKK added 150,518 shares, acquiring around $15 million worth of shares in the stablecoin issuer. ARK also added BitMine shares. ARKF purchased 26,923 shares, and ARKW added 51,954. ARKK accumulated the single largest amount at 181,774 shares, bringing the total amount to $7.6 million. Related: ARK Invest resumes crypto buying spree, adds BitMine and Bullish shares The buying came as crypto-exposed stocks broadly weakened as the crypto market continues to retreat from October highs. Bullish fell 3.63% on the day to $36.39, continuing its recent slide before recovering slightly in after-hours trading. Circle closed the session down nearly 9% at $69.72. BitMine finished the day down 9.5% at $29.18, though it recovered more than 6% after hours. Michael Saylor-led Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy was hit even harder, dropping 9.82% on the day before recovering some losses in the after-hours. Notably, ARK has been on a crypto buying spree over the past week amid tumbing crypto prices.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum staking plans with new Delaware trust
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-expands-ethereum-staking-plans-with-new-delaware-trust/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T07:55:09Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has taken another step toward a staking-focused Ethereum ETF by setting up a new statutory trust in Delaware, signalling fresh movement in the fast-growing market for yield-generating crypto products. The trust, called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, was officially formed on Nov. 19, according to state records. While the filing does not include product documents, it adds to a broader industry shift toward staking features within regulated ETFs. The move positions BlackRock to explore yield-bearing structures as competitors such as Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey advance their own staking plans across major digital asset funds. The new trust was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires full disclosures before any product reaches investors. This registration serves as a preliminary step rather than a full submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. To move forward, BlackRock would still need to file a Form S-1, but the firm has not provided a timeline. Delaware continues to be a popular state for early-stage ETF setup because of its regulatory structure, and BlackRock has often used the same route when preparing digital asset products. The trust now sits alongside ETHA, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF that launched in July 2024. ETHA has attracted more than $13 billion in inflows and currently does not stake its holdings. Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 in July 2025 to allow ETHA to stake ETH with approved validators. If approved, that update would introduce staking rewards while also requiring detailed disclosures about custody arrangements, slashing risks, validator selection, and the handling of locked ETH. Staking rewards on Ethereum generally range between 3% and 5% each year, and issuers must explain how they will track, calculate, and distribute those rewards. BlackRock’s move comes as the broader ETF market accelerates toward staking-enabled products. Grayscale received approval in October 2025 to introduce staking within ETHE and its Mini Trust ETF, making them the first Ethereum funds under the 1933 Act permitted to earn staking rewards. Other issuers, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey, have also submitted similar filings. REX-Osprey already operates a staked Solana ETF and launched a staked Ethereum version in September. BlackRock’s digital assets head Robert Mitchnick said staking features across ETFs could attract between $10 and $20 billion by mid-2026. Experts now expect the next catalyst to be BlackRock’s potential S-1 submission, which would move the new trust closer to becoming a yield-bearing Ethereum ETF. ETF analysts say expanding staking options could lock a significant amount of ETH within regulated products, influencing liquidity and long-term supply. The combination of new filings, updated fund structures, and rising capital inflows has set up a competitive race among issuers. BlackRock’s new trust adds another step in that process, signalling how institutional demand for Ethereum staking continues to reshape the ETF landscape.

BlackRock has now joined the race to launch a staked ether ETF, registering the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware on Nov. 19, according to a state filing highlighted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. The registration is only an initial step and not yet a formal application under the Securities Act of 1933, but it signals that the world’s largest asset manager is preparing to seek approval for a yield-bearing ether product. BlackRock's move comes weeks after VanEck registered a similar trust tied to Lido’s staked ETH, positioning issuers for the next phase of competition once regulators give clarity on whether staking can be included in U.S. ETFs. The first wave of spot ETH ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC told issuers to strip the feature, citing its view that certain staking services could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

Title: Results for the half year ended 30 September 2025

November 20, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: PayPoint plc PayPoint plc PayPoint PlcResults for the half year ended 30 September 2025 Resilient half year performance with good progress on delivery of key growth projects GROUP FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Nick Wiles, Chief Executive of PayPoint Plc, said: “We have continued to build on an encouraging start to the year and in the first half we have reached important milestones in the delivery of major projects key to our long-term growth plans. Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges, we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so. As the current year has progressed, we have faced two challenges: firstly, the impact from the disruption to our parcels network from the harmonisation of InPost and Yodel services combined with the commercial terms of our new 3-year contract has been greater than we had anticipated, and secondly, while obconnect continues to build its new business pipeline and range of opportunities, the pace of growth and monetising of these opportunities in year is slower than we had planned. In the first half, the underlying business performance has continued to trade in line with expectations and, throughout the Group, we have continued to broaden the adoption of our enhanced capabilities into our existing client base, develop and execute on strong new business pipelines and accelerate the execution of our key strategic projects. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service in August 2025 for the Lloyds Banking Group, enabling consumer cash deposits via their banking app across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. In September 2025, we extended the service to enable deposits via card for their customers in 3,000 sites, and we are now working to enable further High St Banks for the service over the next 12 months. In Parcels, we announced the strategic investment by Royal Mail into the Collect+ business in September 2025, with over 3,000 sites now branded as Royal Mail Shop enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collect, send and return parcels. In both these projects the key to the ramp up of significant transaction volumes is a strong follow-on communications and marketing campaign to support consumer awareness and adoption of these services through our network. In Open Banking and Digital payments, we have secured further wins as we grow our strong market position in the Housing sector particularly, including Peabody Housing for the full suite of MultiPay payment solutions and the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments for Confirmation of Payee. In addition, we are delivering several open banking initiatives into our utilities client base while working closely with obconnect in identifying new sector opportunities for open banking. In Love2shop, our partnership with InComm Payments has continued to accelerate, with further expansion into major retailers and a material step up in billings ahead of peak. Consumer uncertainty and tightening household budgets are not new factors as we enter the peak trading period for several of our businesses. For the second half of the year, our focus remains on 1) tight cost discipline and driving efficiencies as we continue to work with Nile Partners to establish the right organisational framework for the future, 2) strong execution of the projects supporting our long-term growth plans, and 3) good operating disciplines across the business as a whole and agility to respond to the two specific business challenges and the broader changing market conditions. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our long-term objectives has provided the platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year” DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Shopping divisional net revenue increased by 0.6% to £33.1 million (H1 FY25: £32.9 million) E-commerce divisional net revenue increased by 7.5% to £8.6 million (H1 FY25: £8.0 million) Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by 4.4% to £26.0 million (H1 FY25: £24.9 million) Love2shop divisional net revenue decreased by 9.6% to £17.0 million (H1 FY25: £18.8 million) MANAGING SPECIFIC BUSINESS CHALLENGES As the current year has progressed, we have faced two specific business challenges: 1. Impact of renewed 3-year commercial contract and InPost/Yodel network harmonisation Following the acquisition of Yodel by InPost, a new 3-year commercial contract was negotiated and agreed for the combined business. This contract recognised the continued importance of the long-term partnership between InPost and PayPoint, including a commitment to a minimum level of volume through the Collect+ network and an expansion of the number of sites offered to InPost customers to reflect the existing Yodel network, albeit on less favourable commercial terms to PayPoint. Our expectation has been that the enlarged Collect+ network for InPost / Yodel customers would result in increased volumes to mitigate these less favourable commercial terms. In the second quarter this has not been the case, with the initiatives from InPost to harmonise the enlarged InPost/Yodel business resulting in significant disruption to service and parcel volumes across the Collect + network. We believe the immediate impact of this operational disruption has now reduced, largely managed through proactive actions from the two businesses and we expect to see volumes through the Collect + network recover as we move into the traditional peak trading period. 2. New business pipeline growth in obconnectIn obconnect, the first half has seen a consolidation in the business and reassessment of the new business opportunities following PayPoint taking a majority ownership of the business. For PayPoint, obconnect delivers the platform to drive growth for both new and existing clients through the provision of Open Banking services and payments channels. In obconnect, the focus is on providing the necessary support and expertise to deliver data sharing ecosystems for major banks and jurisdictions, as well as broader Open Banking solutions. We have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with Verification of Payee (VoP) in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY26 and into next year. Our confidence in the opportunities obconnect brings from its range of capabilities and technology is undiminished. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. The market for Account-to-Account (A2A) payments and account information across Europe, UK and USA remains strong and obconnect is well positioned to help organisations achieve connectivity to these ecosystems. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was also agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for PayPoint and obconnect. Following a maiden contribution in the first half, we expect obconnect to deliver a stronger performance in the second half and an improvement in net revenue achieved for H2 FY25. DELIVERY OF KEY GROWTH PROJECTS The standout achievement of the first half has been the successful launch of multiple projects that enhance our consumer proposition in several areas of our business, establish important partnerships and strengthen the long-term prospects of the business. Each of these projects has required detailed planning and collaboration with our partners and a business wide effort to deliver. In each case the focus is now shifting from rollout to the necessary marketing and consumer awareness campaigns to drive awareness and adoption. 1. Launch of PayPoint BankLocal with the Lloyds Banking Group On 26 August 2025, we launched our BankLocal service enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. This successful launch was supported by a business-wide effort to prepare and train our retailer partners to deliver this vital new service, with over 240,000 direct communications delivered, over 4,000 store visits completed and a Trustpilot score of 4.9/5 achieved from retailer feedback. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed7 since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service further with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. 2. Launch of Royal Mail Shop and strategic investment in Collect+ by Royal Mail As announced on 30 September 2025, International Distribution Services (IDS), owner of Royal Mail, completed a strategic investment in Collect+ to take a 49% ownership, with an investment of £43.9 million, valuing the Collect+ business at £90 million. The Collect+ business has seen strong growth over the past 5 years as we have established it as the leading open Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK. Currently, Collect+ has a network of over 14,000 OOH locations in the UK, of which almost 8,000 offer Royal Mail collect, send and return parcel services today. As part of the next stage in this partnership, over 3,000 of these sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store. The balance of the 8,000 sites will have Royal Mail Shop branding rolled out over the course of the next 6 months. Over the next 12 months the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks by Q4 FY26. 7 As of close of business 16 November 2025 Establishing this partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK. As an open network, Collect+ will continue to work closely with the carrier partners with whom it has well-established relationships to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK and to invest in the technology and training required to deliver an outstanding consumer experience. 3. Acceleration of Love2shop partnership with InComm PaymentsFollowing the launch of our partnership with InComm Payments in October 2024, we have established a strong new sales channel enabling distribution of physical Love2shop gift cards into major grocers and High St brands. The partnership has delivered a strong half year performance, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5%. We have also delivered further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, with sales in this channel +54% year on year, leveraging the strength of the Love2shop brand and reinforcing our expanded multichannel strategy for Love2shop gift card sales across digital and physical channels Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026.

Against the background of a generally weak economy and some specific business challenges we remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year. “We expect underlying EBITDA for FY26 to be ahead of last year and broadly in line with current market expectations. While we continue to make progress towards delivering underlying EBITDA of £100 million in the current financial year – which remains a key financial objective the business is confident of reaching – it is likely we will take longer to do so.

Our longer-term growth targets to the end of FY28 As announced at our full year results in June 2025, we have now established new targets for the Group for the next three years to the end of FY28, reflecting our confidence in the growth prospects of the business and our continued commitment to delivering enhanced returns for our shareholders: 1. Achieving net revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% per annum across the Group Our strategy over the past five years to transform the business and its capabilities from our legacy cash bill payments history has created a more robust and higher organic growth platform. We believe a combination of our business mix today and the opportunities in each of our key building blocks for growth supports a consistent, underlying net revenue growth rate in the range of 5-8% per annum in the medium term. 2. Establishing an organisational framework which will deliver greater automation of processes and greater agility to support the delivery of our planAn important next step to support the delivery of this growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, we have sought the support of Nile, an independent consultancy, in a project to review our operational structure and business processes today and develop a plan to deliver greater automation and business agility in the future to support the delivery of our plan. 3. Delivering a reduction of at least 20% of our issued share capital, with scope for leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x The actions we are taking to deliver sustained organic growth across the business in a more efficient and agile business structure will further enhance the core cash generative characteristics of the business, enabling an accelerated share buyback programme over the next three years within a prudent capital structure of leverage in the range of 1.2x to 1.5x REVIEW BY DIVISION SHOPPING DIVISION In Retail Services, it has been an intensive period where we have focused our efforts on supporting our retailer partners to deliver more revenue from PayPoint services and a business-wide effort to prepare and train sites ahead of the major launches of BankLocal and Royal Mail Shops. Our new Store Growth Specialist team, launched at the beginning of the financial year, has continued to have a positive impact with retailers, driven by targeted data and support. The learnings from the success of this team are now being assessed, with a view to scaling best practice across our entire field team. Key focus areas in the half year have been merchandising new Love2shop physical gift card units in over 2,000 sites ahead of the key peak trading period and completing an extensive training and merchandising programme for our BankLocal and Royal Mail Shop rollouts. Over 4,000 site visits have been completed in total, with positive retailer partner feedback and successful launches delivered for both services. In our FMCG consumer engagement proposition, PayPoint Engage, 16 campaigns have been delivered for major consumer brands, leveraging our PayPoint One platform, advertising screens and vouchering capability. In ATMs, there are some early signs of progress from the actions already taken in the business with the estate performance now aligned with LINK industry transaction data. In addition to the recovery plan already implemented at the beginning of the year, we have completed a thorough strategic review of this business, with plans underway to optimise sites across the network driven by data and supported by our enhanced maintenance and support partnership with NoteMachine. In Cards, we continue to strengthen the operating foundation to the business with a greater focus on optimising profitability per merchant: a continued strong performance in Telesales, a reset of our Field sales approach and head count, further processes to support early life merchant experience and churn management, further proposition enhancements for merchants, supported by the improvements to pricing governance, time to transact and customer onboarding delivered in the last financial year. Proposition enhancements for merchants include an updated terminal application enabling split bill and digital receipt functionality, real-time transaction data now live in our merchant mobile app and app registrations in total on course to exceed our target of 10,000 merchants by the end of FY26. We now have 6 integrations and partnerships live for merchants to access our services. In October 2025, we launched our new e-comm product, in partnership with Global Payments, including Pay By Link functionality in the app and integration with major shopping carts. Over H2, there is an active roadmap of future proposition enhancements which will be delivered, including Tap to Pay in app, 7-day settlement and the launch of a ‘Pay Once’ proposition. We have also delivered a positive performance for Business Finance via YouLend, with over £14.6 million of funding provided to businesses, up 58% year on year. In Local Banking, we successfully launched our BankLocal service for the Lloyds Banking Group on 26 August 2025, enabling consumer cash deposits via app for customers of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland across our extensive network of over 30,000 locations. The service has been adopted rapidly by customers, with over £10m of deposits processed since launch and further proactive consumer marketing activity underway by Lloyds to drive awareness of the service. On 30 September 2025, we enhanced this service with over 3,000 sites launched for consumer cash deposits via card, particularly targeted at customers who are not digitally enabled. With over 40% of transactions taking place before 9am and after 5pm, and c.25% of transactions happening at weekends, this service has successfully built on our existing neobank deposit service and has reinforced the vital role that our leading retail network plays in providing a vast range of essential services at the heart of communities across the UK, for everything from banking, utility, parcel, cash and government services. Looking ahead to H2, a second major bank is now going live later than planned in Q4 FY26 and we have plans in progress to enable more High St banks for the service over the course of the next 6 months, as well as enabling a more extensive use of our Counter Cash withdrawal service. In addition, we are well underway with plans to develop and launch an SME solution for cash deposits in 2026. Across the whole division, data analytics is now central to how we operate, make decisions, and deliver value to customers and partners. Analytics have been embedded into decision-making for external clients and retail partners, combining multiple sources like regional performance, demographic insights, and usage patterns. This unified view is a major step forward, and there is the opportunity to refine these models further, expand data sources, and improve predictive accuracy in the future. Our algorithms now recommend tailored product mixes for retailers and identify promotions that drive sales and partner returns, with our investment in AI and machine learning opening the door to further development of predictive analytics, enabling teams to act on insights quickly and effectively. The work ahead in this area will unlock even greater visibility, efficiency, and value for our customers, partners and the business as a whole. E-COMMERCE DIVISION In E-commerce, there continues to be strong momentum for Collect+, with net revenue +7.5% at £8.6 million and parcel transactions growing to 74.3 million. Collect+ is well-established as the leading Out of Home (OOH) store network in the UK and, as an open network, we will continue to work closely with our carrier partners to support the increasing consumer adoption of OOH services across the UK. In the half year, we have successfully grown the Collect+ network to 14,274 sites in new locations and demographics, including a new partnership with Gridserve, the leading EV charging network. As announced on 30 September 2025, Royal Mail has now taken a strategic investment in Collect+. Over 3,000 sites have now been upgraded with Royal Mail Shop branding, of which 2,200 have the ability to deliver Royal Mail over the counter services, enabling customers to buy postage in store as well as collecting, sending and returning parcels. This will form part of over 8,000 sites that will feature Royal Mail Shop branding over the next 6 months. In addition, we have now launched the sale of stamps across the 8,000 sites, including a retail exclusive set of 4 Christmas Stamps available at Royal Mail Shops. Over the next 12 months, the intention is to expand the rollout of Royal Mail over the counter services through the network, including the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. This partnership is important to the next stage of growth for Collect+ and its positioning as the leading OOH store network in the UK, again enhancing our retailer and consumer propositions delivering vital services at the heart of communities across the UK. In the half, we have also signed a new 3-year commercial agreement with InPost and Yodel, including the potential to utilise up to 6,000 Pick Up Drop Off (PUDO) locations within Collect+ network. We had underappreciated the disruptive impact of the InPost/Yodel harmonisation and subsequent logistical challenges in our parcels business but took proactive operational actions to mitigate impact this disruption, including establishing priority routing and collections for high volume stores, dedicated PUDO-only routes and regular communications with affected stores. We expect these actions have now addressed the operational issues in the network, resulting in volumes recovering as we enter the peak trading period. PAYMENTS & BANKING DIVISION In Payments & Banking, our integrated digital payments platform, MultiPay, continues to establish itself as a comprehensive payment solution for clients across card processing, Open Banking, direct debit and cash, with net revenue growth of 17.2% year on year. We have secured further strong wins in the Housing sector, with Peabody, RHP, Orwell Housing Association and Gloucester City Homes, and in the Charity sector with Thames Hospice and Firefighter’s Charity. There continues to be a focus on increasing opportunities to cross-sell payments services within our existing client base, leveraging our wider multichannel payments platform and Open Banking capabilities. Our Open Banking solutions are unlocking further pipeline opportunities, supporting major clients with cheque replacement solutions via our PayPoint OpenPay service and our new Suspense Manager solution, tackling the issue of unallocated customer payments. In Open Banking, we have made further progress in executing on our strategy. In PayPoint, we are focused on winning business with both new and existing clients delivering Open Banking services and payments channels, all enabled by obconnect and Aperidata, with 70 clients now live for our services, including the Department for Work and Pensions and other government departments, and AccessPay for Confirmation of Payee and Thirteen Group live for PISP. In obconnect, we have retained and strengthened relationships with all existing clients (except for one US bank who exited the UK market) as well as adding 6 new client services in H1 FY26. The business has a small number of clients now live with VoP in SEPA. However, the overall opportunity from VoP has been disappointing, and as a result the business has refocused on other growth areas as it builds its new business pipeline and opportunities for H2 FY25 and into next year. Promising discussions are underway with other jurisdictions and some large international banks for secure data-sharing ecosystems, replicating the success of Get Verified for the New Zealand Banking Association which has now been in operation for a year. A UK CoP rule variation championed by PayPoint was agreed by Pay.UK and the scheme participants in September 2025. This expands CoP access to many more organisations, creating new opportunities for both PayPoint and obconnect. In our cash through to digital category, we have now rolled out new display units to a further 2,000 sites, combining our leading portfolio of consumer brands, including Amazon, Netflix, Deliveroo and Uber, with physical Love2shop gift cards in store. This creates a strong consumer proposition, offering the choice of specific cash through to digital brands and our Love2shop multi-retailer redemption card, which is expected to generate meaningful additional card load and revenue opportunities for retailer partners. We intend to expand further the number of stores offering Love2shop physical gift cards and our digital Pin on Receipt brands over the course of H2. The strength of this proposition is evidenced by the sales momentum built with Love2shop gift cards in over 2,600 multiple retailers in the PayPoint network, with sales +54% year on year, and the continuing success of our partnership with InComm Payments offering Love2shop gift cards into a range of major retailers. In addition, our existing neobank cash deposit service processed over £342 million of deposits in the half, complementing our new BankLocal service for High St banks. In Cash, legacy energy bill payments net revenue decreased by 17.7% for the half year consistent with our expectations, with this part of the business continuing to be resilient. Over the half year, the energy price cap, updated by Ofgem on a quarterly basis, was set for pre-pay customers at £1,803 for April to June 2025 and £1,672 for July to September 2025. However, the price cap has been confirmed in the current quarter at £1,707 for pre-pay customers for October to December 2025. LOVE2SHOP DIVISION Overall, Love2shop continues to trade in line with expectations for the current year, with net revenue in H1 affected by the changes to the timing of revenue recognition for expiry of cards following the adoption of a more prudent accounting treatment in FY24. Under the previous policy ‘end of life’ revenue was recognised progressively over the life of the card. Proactive management of this accounting change ahead of the current financial year will result in a stronger H2 performance as the expiry dates of cards issued in prior periods are weighted towards the second half of the current year. While this change results in the deferral of revenue to the expiry date, it has no material impact on the total revenue expected over the life of the cards. Overall, the Love2shop division has had a solid half year, delivering growth in Love2shop Business, a resilient performance in Park Christmas Savings and strong progress in our partnership with InComm Payments. In Love2shop Business, we have delivered a positive performance, with billings +5.8% at £70.9 million (H1 FY25: £67.0 m), driven by a strong performance within Major Accounts and Platform sales. We are also leveraging AI across the business to better drive and target marketing engagement and new campaigns, with positive early results contributing to new business pipelines. Highstreetvouchers.com continues to trade in line with expectations. We have delivered a strong half year from our InComm Payments partnership, with sales of Love2shop physical gift card billings growing in consecutive half year periods by +43.5% since launch in October 2024. We have also made further progress developing our retailer channels for Love2shop gift cards, which has included an expansion to 800+ Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores and a recent expansion to The Range ahead of the key peak trading period. New Love2shop gift cards are also now being rolled out to further PayPoint retailer network locations, supported by our new Store Growth Specialist team, with sales in this channel +54% year on year. Opportunities for growth in these sales channels will be further enhanced with the launch of the Love2Shop digital Mastercard in early 2026 which will enable spend in store, via digital wallet and online, initially as a B2C single load product ahead of B2B and multi-load enabled later in 2026. Park Christmas Savings billings are expected to be broadly flat year on year for the Christmas 2025 season, against the backdrop of tighter consumer spending and fluctuating consumer confidence over the year. This has been supported by a strengthened Agent proposition, including the launch of Agent Perks and a new Agent App with over 13,000 downloads, an improved average order value for returning direct savers, and the launch of a more premium fulfilment experience and packaging for customers receiving orders for Christmas 2025. This again reinforces the enduring appeal and vital role this service plays in helping consumers budget for big occasions and avoid debt, with a Trustpilot rating of 4.6/5 and over £2 million of value delivered to savers each year. MBL, the leading gift card technology platform, processed £81.2 million in gift card value in in the half year (H1 FY25: £40.9 million), reflecting continued strong momentum as a gift card service provider for Greggs, B&M, New Look, Tapi, and schuh, and as a key distributor for over 150 UK retailers' gift cards DETAIL ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE IDS TRANSACTION The net proceeds of £34.1m on the £43.9m IDS investment in Collect+ is after deducting associated costs of £0.4m and £9.4m of tax from the gain on disposal. These proceeds were distributed in the form of a special dividend of 50 pence per share for c. 69 million eligible shares on 31 October 2025, with a resulting payment of £34.5m. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. This investment entitles IDS to a 49% minority share of the profits of Collect+ Brand Limited, which as part of the transaction now includes all revenues and associated costs from the wider E-commerce division, with the previous holding company (Collect+ Holdings Limited) prepared for dissolution. The Board anticipates the transaction as a whole to be EPS enhancing in the first full year to March 2027 through a combination of the special dividend, share consolidation and expected growth in volumes from the Royal Mail services through the Collect+ network. EPS enhancement assumptions include investment costs associated with the branding of the 8,000 Royal Mail sites, technology to support over the counter services, plus the launch of self-service kiosks during Q1 2026. UPDATE ON ORGANISATIONAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME As announced in our full year results in June 2025, an important step to the delivery of growth is to ensure as a business we have the necessary organisational framework to deliver better operational performance at a reduced cost and a higher level of customer service and experience. To achieve this, the Group has recently completed the second phase of a project being supported by Nile, an independent consultancy firm. The key outputs from this phase have been the establishment of a target state framework for three key processes: onboarding, customer support, and billings and settlement. For each of these, key outcomes from moving to the target future state have been established. For example, in the case of onboarding, substantially reducing time taken to onboard new customers. In addition, for each process, this phase has quantified the benefits from moving to this future state, including both financial benefits (increased revenue, lower costs, lower operational risk events) and non-financial benefits (e.g. improved customer service/ satisfaction levels). Preliminary estimates have highlighted at least £2 million of operating profit upside, through a combination of reduced costs and improved net revenue, with the potential to grow this figure further through the next phase of work, which will include identifying technical solutions and external providers to support the shift to the future target state, along with the costs associated with this transition. This work is expected to be completed in advance of our full year results announcement in June 2026, with implementation commencing in early FY27. UPDATE ON CLAIMS AGAINST PAYPOINT In FY24, a number of companies in the PayPoint Group, including PayPoint Plc, received a claim from Global-365 plc and Global Prepaid Solution Limited (“Global 365”) relating to issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem in November 2021 as a resolution of Ofgem’s concerns raised in its Statement of Objections received by the PayPoint Group in September 2020. The Ofgem resolution did not include any infringement findings. Global 365’s claim was heard at a trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal between 10 June and 11 July 2025. PayPoint is confident that it successfully defended the claim by Global 365 and remains of the view that Global 365’s claim fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant PayPoint Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. The parties are awaiting judgment from the Competition Appeal Tribunal. OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND The Board remain confident in delivering further progress in the current year and achieving our medium-term financial goals. Whilst as a business we cannot determine the pace at which new services are adopted by consumers, the delivery of our key projects in the first half of the year is a great reflection of the progress we are making in the delivery of our long-term strategy. Whilst there remain challenges in the broader UK economy and in particular weak consumer confidence and tightening household budgets, we remain focused on the delivery of the key initiatives across the business that will deliver the outcome for the current year and foundations for the longer-term growth in the business. We are now into the most important seasonal trading period for several of our business areas where focused execution is key to the outcome for the current year. Our continued confidence in the growth opportunities in the business and making further progress in our longer-term objectives have provided a strong platform for the Board to further enhance shareholder returns in the current year, with the business on course to generate returns to shareholders of over £90 million through a combination of our ordinary dividend, continuing share buyback programme and special dividend. The Board has declared an interim dividend of [19.8]p per share, an increase of [2.1]% vs the prior year interim dividend of 19.4p per share, consistent with our dividend policy and target cover range of 1.5 to 2.0 times earnings excluding exceptional items. Nick WilesChief Executive 19 November 2025 FINANCIAL REVIEW Total revenue increased by £9.1 million (6.7%) to £144.1 million (September 2024: £135.0 million). Net revenue increased by £0.1 million (0.1%) to £84.7 million (September 2024: £84.6 million). The increase in Love2shop revenue was driven by single-retailer redemption products which have an associated cost of revenue and therefore a relatively small impact on net revenue. Total costs increased by £1.3 million to £59.0 million (September 2024: £57.7 million). The increase includes £1.7 million current period obconnect costs (prior period: £nil). There were also increases in cost of sales, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in finance costs, reflecting the Group’s increased borrowing. These impacts were partially offset by lower overhead costs. Exceptional costs are one-off, non-recurring and do not reflect current operational performance. The £3.2 million charge to September 2025 comprises legal fees incurred in defence of claims served against the Group and costs associated with the organisational framework to deliver greater automation and agility. The prior period exceptional cost comprised legal fees in defence of the same claims, plus the accelerated amortisation of certain modules of L2s ERP systems. The underlying profit before tax decreased by £1.2 million (4.5%) to £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). The current period result includes £1.2 million from the Love2shop segment, a decrease of £1.1 million (47.8%) on the prior period’s £2.3 million. The Love2shop decrease reflects the change in expiry date of sold vouchers. The September 2024 result benefitted from significant non-redemption revenue from expiry on vouchers in August 2024, whereas the equivalent non-redemption revenue will be earned in the second half of the current financial year. Profit before tax decreased by £3.2 million (13.9%) to £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). The decrease is mainly due to the £2.7m adjusting item in the prior period for the increase in fair value of the Group’s investments in obconnect, prior to the acquisition of obconnect in October 2024. Underlying EBITDA decreased by £0.2 million to £37.3 million (September 2024: £37.5 million), comprising £33.3 million for the PayPoint segment (September 2024: £32.0 million) and £4.0 million for the Love2shop segment (September 2024: £5.5 million). Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million), delivered from underlying profit before tax of £25.7 million (September 2024: £26.9 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. Net corporate debt decreased by £13.4 million to £84.0 million at September 2025 (March 2025: £97.4 million). This is as a result of positive cash generation and proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partly offset by working capital requirements in the first six months along with the exceptional settlement payment, share buy-back and tax, capex and dividend requirements. At 30 September 2025 loans and borrowings were £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million). PAYPOINT SEGMENT Shopping net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million). Service fees net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) driven by the additional PayPoint Mini sites and the annual RPI increase. Cards net revenue decreased by £0.5 million (3.0%); a reduction in acquiring revenue was partially offset by an increase in lending revenue, with rental revenue flat. ATM and Counter Cash net revenue decreased by £0.2 million (5.0%) due to a reduction in transactions driven by the continuing trend of reduced demand for cash across the economy. E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million), driven by strong growth in transaction numbers, which increased by 20.0%. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Payments & Banking net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), including £1.9 million net revenue from obconnect, acquired by the Group in October 2024. Excluding the impact of obconnect, net revenue decreased by £0.8 million compared with the prior period. Cash bill payments and top ups revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million) driven by a 15.1% reduction in transactions caused by reduced usage of cash and the continued switch to digital payments. Digital net revenue, excluding obconnect, increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million). The cost of commission to retailers increased by £1.3 million (6.5%) to £21.3 million (September 2024: £20.0 million). This increase in payment to our retailer partners reflects an increase in the number of transactions processed and a higher proportion of transactions with higher commission rates. Total costs (excluding adjusting items) increased by £2.0 million (4.9%) to £43.2 million, including a £0.9 million increase in finance costs due principally to the share buy-back programme, £1.8 million obconnect costs following acquisition in October 2024, £0.5 million additional depreciation on cards devices, partially offset by a £1.2m decrease in overhead and other costs, reflecting cost saving measures implemented. SECTOR ANALYSIS SHOPPING Shopping consists of services PayPoint provides to retailer partners, which form part of PayPoint’s network, and SME partners. Services include providing the PayPoint One platform (which has a basic till application), EPoS, card payments, terminal leasing, ATMs, Counter Cash and FMCG vouchering. Net revenue increased by £0.2 million (0.6%) to £33.1 million (September 2024: £32.9 million) primarily due to the growth in service fees. The net revenue of each of our key products is separately addressed below. As at 30 September 2025, PayPoint had a live terminal in 30,962 UK sites, an increase of 2.7% primarily due to new PayPoint mini sales. Service fees: This is a core growth area and consists of service fees from PayPoint One, PayPoint Mini and our legacy terminals. Service fee net revenue increased by £0.9 million (8.4%) to £11.6 million driven by an increase in the number of revenue- generating sites compared to the prior period. Card Payments: Card payments net revenue overall decreased by 3.0% to £16.1 million (September 2024: £16.6 million). Card payments acquiring services generated £10.3 million net revenue in the six-month period, a reduction of £0.9 million from the previous year (September 2024: £11.2 million), reflecting the decrease in the number of SME and retailer partners and in the average value processed per merchant. Card payments lending and other net revenue increased by £0.4 million to £0.6 million. Transaction values overall decreased by 4.4% to £3,428 million (September 2024 £3,585 million). Card payment terminal rentals remained at £5.2 million, with a slight reduction in the number of terminals. Net revenue reduced by £0.2m (5.0%) to £3.8 million (September 2024: £4.0 million) as transactions reduced by 9.4% to 11.5 million. This reflects a continuation of the reduced demand for cash across the economy, although net revenue from Counter Cash was flat. ATM and Counter Cash live sites increased 9.3% to 7,094, reflecting the new local banking service which went live in September 2025. Other: Other shopping services, which includes FMCG voucher campaigns, remained at £1.6 million. E-COMMERCE E-commerce net revenue increased by £0.6 million (7.5%) to £8.6 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) due to the continued increase in total parcels transactions, by 20.0% to 74.3 million. This was due to our continued strength in the clothing/fashion category and the impact of new carrier partners, partially offset by the impact of the terms of the new commercial deal with Yodel. Parcel sites increased by 6.4% to 14,274 sites. PAYMENTS & BANKING Payments & Banking divisional net revenue increased by £1.1 million (4.4%) to £26.0 million (September 2024: £24.9 million), benefitting from the £1.9 million contribution from obconnect. This was partially offset by the impact of fewer cash bill payments and top up transactions. Cash - bill payments and top ups net revenue decreased by £1.6 million (12.7%) to £11.0 million (September 2024: £12.6 million). Digital (MultiPay, Direct Debits, Cash Out and Open banking) net revenue increased by £0.6 million (9.5%) to £6.9 million (September 2024: £6.3 million) and digital transactions increased by 1.8 million (9.0%) to 21.9 million. MultiPay net revenue increased by £0.5 million to £3.4 million (September 2024: £2.9 million) with transactions remaining at 13.9 million. Cashout net revenue decreased by £0.1 million (7.3%) to £1.1 million (September 2024: £1.2 million). Cash through to digital (eMoney) net revenue increased by £0.1 million (2.9%) to £3.5 million (September 2024: £3.4 million) and transactions increased by 0.7 million (18.2%) to 4.5 million (September 2024: 3.8 million). eMoney transactions derive a substantially higher fee per transaction than traditional top-up transactions as they are more complex to process. Other Payments & Banking net revenue includes SIM sales, interest generated by investing cash received on client funds and other ad-hoc items which contributed £2.7 million (September 2024: £2.6 million) net revenue. LOVE2SHOP SEGMENT Love2shop (L2s) generated £106.7 million total billings in the period, an increase of 4.6% on the prior period. Billings are a measure of the total value of balance sold on cards and vouchers. The business is seasonal in nature, and profit is primarily generated in the second half of the financial year, which represents the peak trading period of the L2s corporate business and of the dispatch of Park Christmas savings prepaid products prior to Christmas The £5.7 million (11.5%) increase in revenue is largely attributable to single-retailer cards and vouchers, partially offset by a £2.1 million decrease in non-redemption income. The latter reflects the change in the annual expiry date of a significant proportion of cards and vouchers, from the first half of the prior financial year to the second half of the current financial year. Net revenue for the 6 months to 30 September 2025 was £17.0 million, a decrease of £1.8 million (9.6%) on prior period, principally due to the decrease in non-redemption income referred to above. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND TAXATION The income tax charge of £5.0 million (September 2024: £5.8 million) on profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million) represents an effective tax rate of 24.9% (September 2024: 25.1%). This is lower than the UK statutory rate of 25% due to the tax impact of share-based payments. GROUP STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Net assets of £102.0 million (September 2024: £104.2 million) decreased by £2.2 million, reflecting the continuation of the share buyback program and dividends, partially offset by profit for the period and the part-disposal of Collect+. Current assets increased by £15.2 million to £364.6 million (September 2024: £349.4 million), mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets of £240.6 million (September 2024: £238.3 million) increased by £2.3 million, of which £16.6 million arose on the acquisition of obconnect (£12.2 million goodwill, £11.0 million intangible assets, less £6.6 million previously recorded as investments). Partially offsetting this was a £12.3 million decrease in the fair value of the Group’s investments in Yodel. Current liabilities increased by £6.5 million to £364.4 million (September 2024: £357.9 million), including a £7.4 million increase in the share buyback liability. Phase two of the share buy-back programme, which commenced in July 2025, was for £30 million of committed share purchases, compared with £20 million for phase one. Non-current liabilities of £138.9 million (September 2024: £125.6 million) increased by £13.3 million, including a £7.1 million increase in loans and borrowings, a £3.6 million increase in deferred tax, of which £2.5 million arose on the obconnect acquired intangible assets, and a £3.6 million settlement provision. At 30 September 2025 net corporate debt was £84.0 million (September 2024: £86.8 million), a decrease of £13.4 million from the year end position. This derives from positive cash generation and net proceeds from the part-disposal of Collect+, partially offset by tax, capex and dividend requirements, along with an exceptional settlement and share buy-back payments. Total loans and borrowings of £114.1 million (September 2024: £107.2 million), increased by £11.8 million from 31 March 2025, and comprise a £75.0 million non-amortising term loan, £40.0 million drawdown of the £90.0 million revolving credit facility, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.3 million arrangement fees (September 2024: £63.0 million drawdown from the revolving credit facility, £45.0 million non-amortising term loan, £0.4 million accrued interest less £1.2 million arrangement fees). GROUP CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY The following table summarises the cash flow movements during the period. Cash generation decreased to £24.2 million (September 2024: £30.7 million) delivered from profit before tax of £19.9 million (September 2024: £23.1 million). There was a net working capital outflow of £6.1 million, £4.6 million of which relates to the timing of Love2shop product purchase and despatch and will unwind in the second half of the financial year. The remaining £1.5 million is principally due to professional fee payments in the current period, related to prior period exceptional items. The working capital outflow is higher than the prior period outflow, which benefitted from a £3.0 million cash collection from a key account in September 2024. The £10.4 million exceptional settlement payment relates to the Utilita accrual disclosed in the March 2025 financial statements. The £1.5 million pension contribution was to the L2s defined benefit scheme. The £43.5 million inflow from the part-disposal of subsidiary relates to the investment by IDS in the Group’s parcel division and is net of disposal costs. The £13.0 million share buyback outflow in the period exceeds the £4.4 million in the prior period, which included only 3 months’ share purchases of a lower annual committed amount than the current period commitment. Capital expenditure of £10.5 million (September 2024: £8.9 million) was £1.6 million higher than the prior period, primarily the result of software development investment to modernise heritage systems and Love2shop’s e-commerce project. DIVIDENDS In the six months to 30 September 2025, total dividend payments were £13.9 million or 19.6 pence per share (September 2024: £13.9 million or 19.2 pence per share), representing the final ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2025. This is a 2.1% increase on the final dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2024. On 17 October 2025 the Group approved a special dividend of 50.0 pence per share, paid on 29 October 2025 to shareholders on the register on 17 October 2025, representing c. 69 million eligible shares. Alongside this, the 12 for 13 share consolidation on 17 October 2025 reduced the issued share capital by c. 5.3 million shares to c. 63.7 million shares in issue as of this date. We have declared an increased interim dividend of 19.8 pence per share (September 2024: 19.4 pence) payable in equal instalments of 9.9 pence per share on 19 December 2025 and 27 March 2026 (to shareholders on the register on 28 November 2025 and 27 February 2026 respectively). This is an increase of 1.0% compared to the final dividend declared of 19.6 pence per share, and an increase of 2.1% compared to 19.4 pence per share interim dividend for prior year. In aggregate, the special dividend and interim dividends will result in £46.9 million (September 2024: £13.9 million) being paid to shareholders from the standalone statement of financial position of the Company which, as at 30 September 2025, had approximately £101.4 million (September 2024: £67.9 million) of distributable reserves. CAPITAL ALLOCATION The Board’s immediate priority is to continue to preserve PayPoint’s balance sheet strength. The Group maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term that allows a healthy mix of returns to shareholders and cash for investments. The Group’s capital allocation priorities are as follows: GOING CONCERN The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having regard to the identified principal risks and uncertainties. Our cash and borrowing capacity provides sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group including dividends.

Accounting policies Reporting entity PayPoint plc (‘PayPoint’ or the ‘Company’) is a public limited company, incorporated and registered in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered office is at Unit 1, The Boulevard, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, AL7 1EL. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements (‘interim financial statements’) as at and for the six months ended 30 September 2025 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). They were approved for issue on 20 November 2025. These interim financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved by the board of directors on 11 June 2025 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any statements under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been reviewed, not audited. Basis of preparationThe interim financial statements for the half-year reporting period ended 30 September 2025 have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. Adoption of standards and policiesThe accounting policies applied by the Group in the interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025 are consistent with those set out in the Group’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt-to-equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings. The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash and borrowing capacity provide sufficient funds to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group. At 30 September 2025, the Group had corporate cash of £30.1 million. On 11 June 2025, the Group completed an amendment to its borrowing facilities, to manage its working capital requirements and capital allocation. Its borrowing facilities now consist of: At 30 September 2025, £40.0 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility (30 September 2024: £63.0 million). The Group’s statement of financial position shows net assets of £102.0 million as at 30 September 2025 (£104.2 million as at 30 September 2024), having made a profit after tax for the period of £14.9 million (30 September 2024: £17.3 million) and delivered cash from operations of £20.8 million for the period (30 September 2024: £36.4 million). The Group has net current assets of £0.2 million at 30 September 2025 (30 September 2024: net current liabilities of £8.5 million). The Directors consider the going concern period as twelve months from the date of signing of these interim financial statements and have reviewed detailed monthly cash flow forecasts from the Group over this period. In this ‘base case’ scenario, the cash flow forecasts show considerable liquidity headroom and debt covenants will be met throughout the period. In addition, the Directors have considered and confirm there are no significant or material events that have been identified beyond the going concern period that may cast doubt upon the continuing use of the going concern basis. In addition to the ‘base case’ scenario, the Directors have prepared a ‘downside’ scenario which includes the following assumptions: Shopping E-commerce Payments and banking Love2shop Even with the above assumptions, the forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom and liquidity for the Group to continue with its existing borrowing facilities. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of not less than 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. Use of judgements and estimatesIn the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical judgement: recognition of cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds held on deposit The nature of payments and banking services means that PayPoint collects and holds funds on behalf of clients as those funds pass through the settlement process and retains retailer partners’ deposits as security for those collections. Following the Love2shop acquisition, it also holds card and voucher deposits on behalf of agents, cardholders and redeemers, some of which is held in trust. A critical judgement in this area is whether each of the above categories of funds, and restricted funds held on deposit, are recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position, and whether they are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of consolidated cash flows. This includes evaluating: (a) the existence of a binding agreement, such as a legal trust, clearly identifying the beneficiary of the funds;(b) the identification of funds, ability to allocate and separability of funds;(c) the identification of the holder of those funds at any point in time; and(d) whether the Group bears the credit risk Where there is a binding agreement specifying that PayPoint holds funds on behalf of the client (i.e. acting in the capacity of a trustee) and those funds have been separately identified as belonging to that beneficiary, the cash (referred to as ‘Clients’ own funds’) and the related liability are not included on the Consolidated statement of financial position. In all other cases, the Group has access to the interest on such monies and can, having met certain conditions, withdraw the funds. The cash and corresponding liability are therefore recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position. Corporate cash and cash equivalents consists of cash freely available to the Group for use in its daily operations and is presented as a separate line item on the Consolidated statement of financial position from non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, which is not freely available to the Group, either because of self-regulation and segregation or due to contractual or regulatory requirements. Non-corporate cash and cash equivalents comprises: Both corporate cash and non-corporate cash are included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of cash flows. Restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate), comprises gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash. However, unlike the gift card voucher cash and prepay savers’ cash included in non-corporate cash and cash equivalents, restricted funds held on deposit (non-corporate) may only be accessed after a minimum of three months. Consequently, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated statement of financial position and the Consolidated statement of cash flows. The amounts recognised on the Statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 are as follows: Clients’ own fundsClients’ cash held in trust off the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2025 is £50.8 million (30 September 2024: £49.4 million). Alternative performance measuresNon-IFRS measures or alternative performance measures are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes and have remained consistent with the alternative performance measures disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2025. These measures are included in these interim financial statements to provide additional useful information on performance and trends to shareholders. These measures are not defined terms under IFRS and therefore they may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures. Underlying performance measures (non-IFRS measures)Underlying performance measures allow shareholders to understand the operational performance in the year, to facilitate comparison with prior years and to assess trends in financial performance. They usually exclude the impact of one-off, non- recurring and exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, such as brands and customer relationships. The adjusting items between the Group’s statutory and underlying performance measures are as follows: See note 5 for explanations of the above exceptional items. Love2Shop billings (non-IFRS measures relating solely to the Love2Shop segment)Billings represents the value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers during the period and is recorded net of VAT, rebates and discounts. Billings is an alternative performance measure, which the directors believe provides an additional measure of the level of activity other than total revenue. This is due to billings being recognised at a different time to revenue from multi-retailer redemption products being reported on a ‘net’ basis, whilst revenue from single-retailer redemption products and other goods are reported on a ‘gross’ basis. Net revenue (non-IFRS measure)Net revenue is total revenue less commissions paid (to retailer partners and Park Christmas agents) and the cost of revenue for items where the Group acts in the capacity of principal (including single-retailer vouchers and SIM cards). This reflects the benefit attributable to the Group’s performance, eliminating pass-through costs to create comparability of performance under both the agent and principal revenue models. It is a key consistent measure of the overall success of the Group’s strategy. A reconciliation from revenue to net revenue is included in note 4. Total costs (non-IFRS measure)Total costs comprise other costs of revenue, administrative expenses, financing income and finance costs. Total costs exclude adjusting items, being exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and net movement on convertible loan notes. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group presents EBITDA as it is widely used by investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate profitability of companies. This measures earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) (non-IFRS measure)The Group also presents adjusted EBITDA, which comprises EBITDA, as defined above, excluding exceptional items and net movements on convertible loan notes and other investments. Underlying earnings per share (non-IFRS measure)Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit before adjusting items attributable to equity holders of the parent by the basic or diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue. Underlying profit before tax (non-IFRS measure)Underlying profit before tax represents statutory profit before tax excluding adjusting items. Net corporate debt (non-IFRS measure)Net corporate debt represents corporate cash and cash equivalents less amounts borrowed under financing facilities (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities). The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents to net corporate debt is as follows: 2. Segmental reportingThe Group considers its Love2shop business to be a separate segment from its legacy PayPoint business, since discrete financial information is prepared for Love2shop and it offers different products and services. Furthermore, the chief operating decision maker (CODM) reviews separate monthly internal management reports (including financial information) for both Love2shop and PayPoint to allocate resources and assess performance. The material products and services offered by each segment are as follows: PayPoint Love2shop Information related to each reportable segment is set out below. Segment profit / (loss) before tax and adjusting items is used to measure performance because management believes that this information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments relative to other entities that operate in the same industries. The Group operates exclusively in the UK. 3. Revenue Disaggregation of revenue Service fee revenue of £11.5 million (September 2024: £10.7 million) and management fees, set-up fees and up-front lump sum payments of £0.7 million (September 2024: £0.7 million) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the contract. Card terminal leasing revenue is recognised over the expected lease term using the sum of digits method for finance leases and on a straight-line basis for operating leases. Multi-retailer voucher, card and e-code service fee revenue is recognised on redemption by the customer. Multi-retailer non-redemption revenue is recognised when the product has expired (and, where applicable, when the right of refund has lapsed). The remainder of revenue is recognised at the point in time when each transaction is processed. The usual timing of payment by PayPoint customers is on fourteen-day terms. The usual timing of Love2shop’s corporate customers is fifteen-day terms; its consumer customers pay on ordering. Revenue subject to variable consideration of £6.5 million (September 2024: £8.0 million) exists where the consideration to which the Group is entitled varies according to transaction volumes processed and rate per transaction. Management estimates the total transaction price using the expected value method at contract inception, which is reassessed at the end of each reporting period, by applying a blended rate per transaction to estimated transaction volumes. Any required adjustment is made against the transaction prices in the period to which it relates. The revenue is recognised at the constrained amount to the extent that it is highly probable that the inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, with the estimates based on projected transaction volumes and historical experience. The potential range in outcomes for revenue subject to variable consideration resulting from changes in these estimates is not material. Love2shop revenue is recorded net of corporate discounts. Seasonality of operationsFollowing the Group’s acquisition of Love2shop on 28 February 2023, its performance is now considered “highly seasonal” under IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The Love2shop business is heavily weighted towards the second half of the financial year, in particular the peak September to December pre-Christmas period when revenues from card, voucher and e-code redemptions are at their highest. The PayPoint business is far less seasonal, although its e-commerce division also generates its highest revenues in the pre- Christmas months. Bill payment transactions, which were historically higher during the winter months (H2), continue to be impacted by the shift in consumer behaviour towards making fewer, larger payments and structural changes in this market. Card payments typically generate higher value processed and revenue in the summer months (H1). Card terminal leasing revenue is relatively unaffected by seasonality. Other revenue Other revenue comprises: 4. Alternative performance measures Net revenue The reconciliation between total underlying revenue and net revenue is as follows: Total costs excluding adjusting items 5. Exceptional items The tax impact of the exceptional items is £0.79 million (September 2024: £0.62 million) Exceptional items are those which are considered significant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as exceptional within their relevant income statement categories to assist in the understanding of the performance and financial results of the Group, as they do not form part of the underlying business. Legal feesThe current period legal fees relate to the Group’s defence of two claims served on a number of its companies in connection with issues addressed by commitments accepted by Ofgem as a resolution of its concerns raised in Ofgem’s Statement of Objections received by the Group in September 2020. The Group remains confident that it will successfully defend the claim served by Global-365. See note 12. Organisational framework costsThe current period organisational framework costs are fees to a third party engaged to support the Group deliver greater automation and agility. The work is expected to be completed during the year ending 31 March 2027, with total costs expected to exceed £1 million. 6. Tax 7. Earnings per shareBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue as follows: 8. Investments The fair values of the Group’s investments are as follows: No unrealised gains or losses arose in the current or prior period. Judge Logistics LtdJudge Logistics Ltd is the parent company of Yodel Ltd, a customer in the Group’s ecommerce parcel business. The Group’s investment in Judge Logistics Ltd is an equity investment of 4.5% of the ordinary share capital. This comprises an initial equity investment purchased for consideration of £100 on 26 July 2024 and a further 3.6% investment arising on conversion of the Group’s £15 million convertible loan note on 17 April 2025. At 31 March 2025 the Company revalued its investments at fair values of £540,000 for the equity investment and £2,159,000 for the convertible loan note, i.e. £2,699,000 in aggregate. At 30 September 2025, based on the Company’s fair value assessment, it has maintained the fair value of its investment at £2,699,000. Aperidata LtdIn May 2024, the Group acquired an equity investment of 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Aperidata Ltd for £0.2 million and purchased a convertible loan note investment in Aperidata Ltd for consideration of £1.0 million. At 31 March 2025 and at 30 September 2025, the Company fair valued the investments at their respective costs. 9. Part-disposal of subsidiaryOn 18 July 2025, the Company disposed of 20% of its investment in a wholly owned subsidiary, Collect+ Brand Ltd, to International Distribution Services plc (“IDS”), a third-party partner in the Group’s e-commerce division. The consideration, net of transaction costs, was £11.9 million. On 30 September 2025, the Company disposed of a further 29% of its investment in Collect+ Brand Ltd to IDS for consideration of £31.6 million, net of transaction costs. Total net consideration received was therefore £43.5 million. The Group retains control of Collect+ Brand Ltd following the above transactions, due to the rights associated with the Group’s remaining 51% ownership. Consequently, the Group continues to account for Collect+ Brand Ltd as a subsidiary. It now also recognises a non-controlling interest, to which 49% of Collect+ Brand Ltd’s post-tax result is attributed in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss. The combined transaction gave rise to a post-tax gain on disposal of £34.0 million reported within equity, in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements (see Consolidated statement of comprehensive income). 10. Share capital, share premium, merger reserve and capital redemption reserve In the current period 140,828 shares were issued (of 1/3p each) for share awards which vested in the period and 7,432 matching shares were issued (of 1/3p each) under the Employee Share Incentive Plan. On 17 October 2025, the Group carried out a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date, following which the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share (see note 13). On 12 June 2025, the Group announced that the share buy-back programme, which it began on 1 July 2024 for an initial 12-month period, would be extended until the end of March 2028. The Group plans to purchase at least £30 million of shares per annum, in an extension to the programme which began on 1 July 2025. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group therefore recognised an initial liability for the full amount of £30.2 million (including stamp duty and associated costs) in the current period, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. A total of 1,859,450 shares were purchased in the period, with a nominal value of £6k. This resulted in a reduction in share capital of £6k and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve balance from £7k to £13k. The share premium of £1.0 million (September 2024: £1.0 million) represents the payment of deferred, contingent share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the i-movo acquisition. The merger reserve of £18.2 million (September 2024: £18.2 million) comprises £1.0 million initial share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued on the initial acquisition of i-movo and £17.2 million share consideration in excess of the nominal value of shares issued in relation to the Love2shop acquisition. 11. Notes to the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 12. Contingent liabilityOfgem statement of objectionsFurther to the update provided on 12 June 2025, the Group’s position remains unchanged: it is confident that it will successfully defend the claim by Global 365, which fundamentally misunderstands the energy market and the relationships between the relevant Group companies and the major energy providers, whilst also over-estimating the opportunity available, if any, for the products offered by Global 365. As a result, no accounting provision has been made for this claims. The Group will continue to update the market on a quarterly basis as part of its financial reporting cycle. HMRC assessmentIn February 2024, HMRC raised an assessment on the Group’s tax position for the accounting period ended 31 March 2021. The Group has appealed the assessment on the grounds that it is not valid from a tax technical and administrative perspective and no provision has therefore been recognised. 13. Events after the reporting dateShare consolidation and special dividendAt a special general meeting held on 17 October 2025, the Group’s shareholders approved a share consolidation of 12 new ordinary shares for 13 existing ordinary shares, applicable to shareholders on the register on that date. As a result of the share consolidation, the new ordinary shares have a nominal value of 0.3611 pence per share. In all other respects, the new ordinary shares are equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, including their dividend, voting and other rights. At the same special general meeting on 17 October 2025, following approval of the share consolidation, the Group’s shareholders approved a special dividend of 50 pence per new ordinary share, payable to shareholders on the register on that date. The special dividend payment of £34.5 million was made on 31 October 2025. PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Our risk management and internal control framework is designed to ensure that the Group maintains an effective and dynamic risk management process which identifies our risk exposures, ensures our programme of mitigating controls operates effectively and provides assurance to our stakeholders that effective risk management is embedded in our operations. The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties remain closely aligned to those risks disclosed in the Strategic Report section of its Annual Report for the year ended 31st of March 2025 and are detailed below. RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT We confirm that to the best of our knowledge this set of interim financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as contained in UK-adopted IFRS and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7 (indication of important events during the first half and description of principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining half of the year) and DTR 4.2.8 (disclosure of related parties’ transactions and changes therein). Nick Wiles Rob HardingChief Executive Finance Director Independent review report to PayPoint Plc Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements Our conclusionWe have reviewed PayPoint Plc’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “interim financial statements”) in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc for the 6 month period ended 30 September 2025 (the “period”). Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The interim financial statements comprise: The interim financial statements included in the Interim results of PayPoint Plc have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (“ISRE (UK) 2410”). A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We have read the other information contained in the Interim results and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements. Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (UK) 2410. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review Our responsibilities and those of the directors The Interim results, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim results in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Interim results, including the interim financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the Interim results based on our review. Our conclusion, including our Conclusions relating to going concern, is based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion paragraph of this report. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

Title: 1 in 3 young investors switched advisers over crypto access: Survey

Time Published: 2025-11-20T05:30:20Z

Young and rich investors want wealth advisers to offer crypto, and some have moved their money from those who don’t, according to a survey by Zerohash. Money managers may need to rethink their approach to digital assets, with over a third of young, wealthy investors in a recent US survey indicating they had moved on from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Crypto payments provider Zerohash’s survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40, released on Wednesday, found that 35% had moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer access to crypto. Those surveyed had incomes between $100,000 and $1 million, and more than half of those who moved money due to an advisers lack of crypto offerings said they had moved between $250,000 and $1 million. Crypto has only recently enjoyed an ultra-friendly policy environment in the US, and some wealth advisers are still playing catch-up as younger investors are less risk-averse compared to past generations. Zerohash said that over four-fifths of those surveyed said their confidence in crypto was boosted due to its adoption by major finance institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. Zerohash found that respondents with incomes of $500,000 and up were “leading the exodus,” with half having moved from advisers over crypto access. The survey also found 84% of all respondents planned to increase their crypto holdings in the next year, with nearly half saying they would “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the findings show that crypto “has become essential to modern portfolio strategy” and many wealthy investors “are not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up.” “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” they said. Related: US government reopening may unleash crypto ETF floodgates: Analyst They added that investors were clear with their expectations and wanted “insured, compliant crypto access.” Zerohash said based on its survey results, its playbook for advisers to win investors is to offer crypto on “the same dashboard as traditional assets” with insured custody. “Investors expect more than Bitcoin and Ethereum,” it added. “Ninety-two percent say access to a broader range of digital assets is important.” Meanwhile, asset managers have begun offering exchange-traded products with exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, with products tied to altcoins including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE). More novel products have featured staking, which rewards users for locking up tokens to secure a blockchain. Major issuer BlackRock is also seemingly set to offer staking exposure, filing for a staked Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund in Delaware on Wednesday.

Title: A shorter shopping window complicates retail’s already challenging holiday season
URL: http://digiday.com/marketing/a-shorter-shopping-window-complicates-retails-already-challenging-holiday-season/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T05:01:00Z

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was originally published on sister site, Modern Retail. This season, retailers and shoppers alike are contending with a shorter holiday shopping window — on top of tariffs, waning consumer sentiment and recession fears. The 2025 holiday shopping season is shorter than usual, with 28 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That’s one extra day compared to last year’s ultra-condensed shopping season, but four fewer shopping days than 2023. Cyber Monday will fall in December this year, and Christmas will be on a Thursday. By some metrics, the holiday shopping season is shaping up to be merry and bright. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising as much as 4.2% over last year. Similarly, EMarketer is forecasting holiday sales of $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year over year. But the holiday season is unfolding against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. U.S. employment is worsening with the highest level of October layoffs in 22 years last month, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Retail was one of the most heavily impacted industries, Modern Retail previously reported. Tariffs and inflation have also negatively colored consumer sentiment heading into retail’s biggest sales season. Consumer sentiment has fallen about 6% in November so far, according to the most recent survey from the University of Michigan. All told, this year’s condensed shopping calendar is landing at a difficult moment for the industry. Retailers are already juggling tariff-related cost pressures that have complicated everything from inventory planning to pricing strategy, and now they have fewer days to make up crucial fourth-quarter sales. Consumers, meanwhile, are heading into the season with shaky confidence, tighter budgets and heightened sensitivity to prices. Taken together, a shorter runway and a more cautious shopper are reshaping when — and how much — people are willing to spend, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already strained holiday period.“We’re going to see a lot of different headwinds this year, and this is one of them,” said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney, where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. Here’s a look at how retailers and consumers are preparing for a shorter holiday season complicated by President Donald Trump’s trade war, inflation and a worsening labor market. Over the past few years, retailers have pulled forward the timing of holiday deals, kicking off the season outside of tentpole occasions like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year was no exception, as Amazon effectively kicked off the holiday season with its earliest ever “Big Deals Prime Day” sale in October. The sale ran from Oct. 7 through Oct. 8, slightly earlier than last year’s event, when the sales ran from Oct. 8 until Oct. 9. Retailers including Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Kohl’s introduced overlapping promotions to pull in early holiday demand ahead of the Black Friday peak. Some retailers introduced their holiday marketing campaigns well before Halloween. Macy’s, for instance, started its “100 Days to Christmas” campaign in September. Meanwhile, Nordstrom launched its holiday season campaign at the end of October. Walmart promoted its Thanksgiving meal basket in late October. That strategy may become even more important this year as retailers navigate fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, along with concerns about how tariffs and inflation may impact consumer spending. Kearney’s Black said that while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the season’s biggest tentpoles, this year’s economic backdrop is amplifying the need for strong early performance. “Cyber Monday and Black Friday have never been more important,” she said, adding that economic uncertainty and higher prices are motivating people to seek out promotions earlier in the season. According to Circana’s annual holiday outlook survey, 44% of U.S. consumers say they plan to begin their holiday shopping earlier than they normally would. That’s up four percentage points higher from Circana’s survey last year. Nearly half of consumers plan to start shopping before Thanksgiving. Less than 20% will wait until December, which marks the lowest level of late-season holiday shoppers since 2021, according to the survey. Black said the shorter holiday shopping calendar may also hinder impulse purchases. “You may be a little less likely to pick up the ‘Oh, I need to get another gift’ thing. … So, it can absolutely have an impact,” she said. A shorter shopping window means operational precision matters more. Retailers have only a few weeks to move inventory and meet tighter shipping deadlines. Black said the fundamentals will be critical: “They need to have fast shipping. It needs to be easy for [the] consumer. They need to have great in-stocks, and the experience really matters.” That pressure is pushing retailers to diversify last-mile options. Kevin Sides, CEO at logistics provider ShipMonk, said shifting volume to regional carriers has become one of the biggest logistics trends across his client base heading into the peak holiday season. Indeed, regional carriers like Jitsu, SpeedX and Veho ramped up their service coverage in the U.S. earlier this year, per Supply Chain Dive. “It’s not just FedEx and UPS getting orders out and delivered anymore. These regionals have way more of a market share,” Sides said, citing alternative parcel carriers like OnTrac and UniUni. “If 50% of your volume [is] not going with a regional, you’re leaving a lot on the table from both cost and performance.” More specialty retailers inked partnerships with delivery startups in 2025, rather than building out their own fulfillment networks, to better compete with behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. Old Navy and DoorDash, for instance, launched a nationwide partnership for same-day delivery of clothing and holiday items, making it one of the first major apparel retailers on the platform. Ace Hardware also inked a deal with DoorDash earlier this year, offering on-demand delivery from local hardware stores. Despite the compressed calendar, Sides said consumers shouldn’t expect widespread delivery disruptions, as long as they avoid last-minute ordering and pay attention to shipping deadlines. “There’s not a carrier that’s not [delivering] packages in time for the holidays when you’re shipping by the third [of December],” he said. “But consumers shouldn’t wait too much to the last minute.” As the season wears on and shipping cutoffs tighten, more shoppers may turn to stores. Bain & Company’s holiday forecast predicts that 36% of U.S. consumers will shop entirely or mostly in physical stores, up from 24% in 2024. Large retailers with expansive store networks can also lean more heavily on same-day and buy-online, pick-up in-store options. Brad Jashinsky, director analyst at Gartner. said these capabilities will become more important as shipping cutoffs approach. As he put it, “That’s where the advantage of Amazon, Walmart, Target and others [comes in], where they can utilize their very sophisticated supply chains or … in-store” fulfillment.

Title: Abu Dhabi Investment Council triples stake in Bitcoin ETF in Q3: Report

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF share price is down almost 23% since the end of the third quarter. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its exposure to Bitcoin during the third quarter through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin fund, according to a recent report. Several market participants saw it as a signal that institutional interest in crypto is still gaining momentum in the United Arab Emirates. ADIC, an investment arm of Mubala Investment Company, told Bloomberg on Wednesday it sees Bitcoin (BTC) as the digital equivalent of gold. ADIC’s IBIT increase came during a volatile period for Bitcoin. The quarter ended just days before BTC surged to an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, before dropping back below $90,000 on Wednesday. Bloomberg reported that ADIC increased its IBIT holdings from 2.4 million shares at the start of Q3 to almost 8 million by Sept. 30, valuing the position at around $520 million. IBIT closed the quarter at $65 per share and rose to $71 on Oct. 6, the day after Bitcoin hit its all-time high. However, Bitcoin’s recent plunge below $100,000 has also dragged IBIT lower. The ETF closed Wednesday at $50.71, down around 23% since the end of the third quarter. Despite the Bitcoin price decline, the ADIC stock increase was widely read as a sign of broader institutional adoption. Crypto investment platform M2 treasury manager, Zayed Aleem, said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that it is “fantastic to see such institutional conviction and another strong signal that the UAE is securing its place as a global hub for digital assets.” Echoing a similar sentiment, crypto commentator MartyParty said that “the position reflects a strategic bet on BTC’s role as a store of value.” The news comes just one day after IBIT experienced its most significant daily outflows since its January 2024 launch, totaling $523.2 million, according to Farside, amid Bitcoin briefly falling to $88,000. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $92,089, according to CoinMarketCap. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Wednesday that the IBIT ETF was having an “ugly stretch.” Related: Crypto exchange Kraken submits confidential US IPO filing “Although YTD flows are still at an astronomical +$25b (6th overall). All told $3.3b in total outflows past month from BTC ETFs, which is 3.5% of AUM,” Balchunas said. Since the IBIT launched in January 2024, it has posted around $63.12 million in net inflows, according to Farside. Analysts are divided on where Bitcoin will go for the remainder of the year. Bitcoin analyst VICTOR recently said that the current drawdown is “the close your eyes and bid type of range.” Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Title: Crypto, tech stocks climb on Nvidia’s blowout Q3 earnings

Nvidia has posted a record quarterly revenue, which has helped dampen fears of an AI bubble and lift crypto and tech stocks. Tech and crypto stocks rose in after-hours trading on Wednesday after chip maker Nvidia’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations on the top and bottom line, allaying fears of an AI bubble. Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter ended Oct. 26, up 62% from a year ago and beating Wall Street projections of $54.7 billion. The company reported a profit of $31.9 billion, a 65% increase from last year and surpassing analyst expectations. It also gave a higher-than-expected guidance of $65 billion in revenue for its fourth quarter, suggesting the appetite for artificial intelligence isn’t yet slowing down. Concerns of an AI bubble had seen tech shares slide over the past weeks, which saw crypto also dump as investors sold off risky assets, and the broader market was awaiting Nvidia’s earnings as a health check on the AI-heavy tech sector. Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) jumped over 5% in after-hours trading on its Q3 earnings to $196 after closing trading on Wednesday up 2.85% to $186.52. The chip maker’s earnings beat helped lift shares across crypto companies after-hours, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle Internet Group (CRCL) all seeing slight bumps after finishing the trading session down. Crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) was also lifted by 1% in post-trading after finishing the day down 3.7% despite beating Wall Street’s predictions and reporting its strongest quarter since going public in August. Related: 21shares Solana ETF launches amid crash, but flows signal investor interest Big Tech stocks were also up, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) all seeing gains after the bell. Nvidia’s earnings have also helped to buoy Bitcoin (BTC), which has dropped over 10% in the past week amid a wider market rout. Bitcoin fell to a 24-hour low of $88,540 in late trading on Wednesday, dipping below $89,000 for the first time since late April. It has since seen a recovery to around $91,500, coinciding with Nvidia’s earnings announcement and is down 0.6% over the past day, per CoinGecko. Ether (ETH) has also seen a recovery after sinking to around $2,873 on Wednesday, its first time under $2,900 since mid-July. It has climbed back above $3,000 and is down 1.9% on the day.

Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. The listing does not include product documentation, but the public entity record can be viewed directly through the state’s search portal. Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. The next stage typically involves filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form depending on the fund structure. The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S., including the REX Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, which launched the first combined spot and staking-enabled Ethereum ETF in late September. Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC’s approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. The move gave the market its earliest regulated benchmark for how staking yield could be passed through to shareholders. Still, dedicated staking-focused Ethereum ETFs remain small. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch. Earlier in July, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to allow additional staking functionality in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). New language in the proposed changes stated the trust would “receive all or a portion of the staking rewards” generated by the staking provider, adding that such rewards may be “treated as income to the Trust.” In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. It also affects the circulating supply, as staked Ethereum is not freely tradeable until it is withdrawn. Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding. Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.

Title: BlackRock signals it is working on a new staked Ethereum trust ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-registers-trust-staked-eth-etf
Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:05:50Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is now pursuing a new staked Ethereum ETF, offering more lucrative returns, approximately 15 months after launching its flagship ETH fund, ETHA. BlackRock has registered for a new staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund in Delaware, signalling that the $13.5 trillion asset manager is now ready to expand beyond its flagship Ethereum ETF product. A Delaware name registration is one of the first steps that a fund issuer needs to take to file for a new ETF. BlackRock, however, still needs to file other relevant documents to put the proposed product on track for regulatory approval. It would also complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted $13.1 billion worth of inflows since launching in July 2024. BlackRock did not add staking to its spot Ethereum product, stating on its website: However, in July, they proposed a rule change with the SEC to incorporate staking into ETHA, along with other issuers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently introduced a generic listing standard enabling faster approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF product is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires strong transparency and investor protection measures, as well as full disclosure before shares can be publicly sold. There are currently around 70 crypto products awaiting regulatory approval, which were held up by the US government shutdown across October and November. Related: Stablecoins strengthen the dollar and empower the developing world BlackRock’s filing comes as REX-Osprey and Grayscale launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October. Incorporating staking into an Ethereum ETF could enhance returns by adding a steady yield component on top of price exposure, thereby transforming the fund into a total-return product. It could therefore broaden the product’s appeal to yield-focused investors who may have avoided Ethereum ETF products due to their lack of income. The average annual return on ETH staking is approximately 3.95%, according to Blocknative data. While other issuers have filed for a multitude of altcoin-focused ETFs in recent months, BlackRock appears to be abstaining, having only recently filed a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September as a sequel to its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The Bitcoin Premium Income ETF also aims to generate yield by selling covered call options and collecting premiums. Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Title: Letters to the Editor, November 20th: On Paschal Donohoe, the President’s new clothes and nefarious neologisms

Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – It is often only in hindsight that we realise how good we had it. Paschal Donohoe was a safe pair of hands in the finance brief, and I predict we will realise that soon. As my late mother would regularly say with a big smile on her face any time he came on TV, “Paschal is just great, isn’t he.” And she was right. He worked harder than any of the rest of us back in our Trinity College Dublin days and he has worked hard since too. Apart from that, he is a good guy. Wishing him continued success. Thank you for your service. – Yours, etc, ANNE MCCORMACK, Rush, Co Dublin. Sir, – I’m surprised that you didn’t publish any more positive letters about Paschal Donohoe (“Resignation of Paschal Donohoe,” Letters, November 19th). Are all your readers supporters of the Opposition and blind to what the rest of Europe and the world value. I think I may be reading the wrong paper. – Yours, etc, OWEN McKEON, Skerries, Co Dublin. Sir, – During the early days of Covid-19, I could not grasp the potential or clandestine medical issues involved, nor could I grasp the medium- to long-term consequences the epidemic might have on human society. I could, however, anticipate that the State’s financial and economic structures and status could well come under severe stress. I was thankful that Paschal Donohoe was our minister for finance. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL GANNON, St Thomas Sq, Kilkenny. Sir, – It can hardly come as a surprise that one of the most senior members of our Government has decided to jump ship (“Donohoe in line for hefty remuneration package at World Bank,” Irish Times, November 18th). The feeling is that many of the doyens now walking the corridors of power are just hanging around until the right job comes along. Self-interest is as good an explanation as any for their long-running failures to address serious social issues. Similarly there can be no surprise that Paschal Donohoe would opt to join an institution such as the World Bank. He will have little difficulty fitting in. The World Bank has been criticised for allowing its policy to be dictated by a select group of multilateral agencies. Indeed, it can be concluded that the bank’s “Harmony and Coherence” policy is little more than a vehicle to allow the most powerful pass off their own self-interest as the common good. Sound familiar? Think of the numerous “plans” to “solve” the housing crisis here. – Yours, etc, JIM O’SULLIVAN, Rathedmond, Co Sligo. Sir, – Paschal Donohoe was a very conservative minister who preserved the status quo for the old monied cabal with a minimal social conscience. His parting legacy will be of a minister for finance who will be remembered for doing nothing for older people, workers, or vulnerable cohorts such as children and the disabled in his final budget, yet who caved into lobbying from the hospitality sector for their commercial demands on the pretext of preserving jobs. Mr Donohoe may have been an effectively prudent fiscal management accountant. This trait will probably suit the World Bank, whose primary objective is to preserve the traditional status quo of the first world nations and ruling established liberal democracies. The former minister was totally risk averse when it came to stimulating creativity, didn’t show an ability to think “outside the box”, and seemed to lack the “vision thing”. He was, therefore, not the statesman needed by us in these unprecedented and challenging times, both nationally and internationally. By all accounts, a very nice man, though. – Yours, etc, STEVE PETHERBRIDGE, Swords, Co Dublin, Sir, – Sincere best wishes to Paschal Donohoe on his move to the World Bank. Hopefully he can help many poor countries escape from debt and develop into fair and successful economies that can trade on an equal footing with the rest of the world. Wishing him every success in this new and demanding role. – Yours, etc, PAUL CONNOLLY, Main St, Cavan. Sir, – Last Friday our national broadcaster RTÉ aired a radio item on its Drivetime show in which the current President’s appearance – her hair and clothes – were parsed and discussed in detail with a guest. I have emailed RTÉ with the following question: in the 14 years of Michael D Higgins’s presidency, did RTÉ ever air a similar news item about his clothes and hair? I’m still waiting for an answer. – Yours, etc, ROSEMARY LAFFERTY, Lucan, Co Dublin. Sir, – The recent correspondence on these pages regarding catering faux pas reminded me of the story told by the late playwright Hugh Leonard. On checking in after midnight to a midlands hotel, he asked: “Any chance of a nightcap?”. The porter replied: “Certainly sir, would you like a drink while you’re waiting?”. – Yours, etc, PETER McCARTHY, Salthill, Galway. Sir, – I admire The Irish Times’s journalistic integrity in reporting exactly what is said, but couldn’t you relax your standards just a little bit to avoid embarrassment to your subjects? I don’t doubt that it’s exactly what she uttered (“Joanne McNally: ‘I was like, I’ll absolutely fly to Ireland and play golf with Bill Murray’,” People, November 19th), but it takes only a minor fib to spare her blushes at being caught out using such a nefarious neologism as the quotative “like”. – Yours, etc, SEAN BOYLE, Warner Rd, London. Sir, – Michael McDowell hits the nail on the head as usual in his column (“Britain’s asylum shake-up creates an Irish problem,” Opinion. November 19th) on the possible fallout for Ireland from proposed changes to asylum procedures and processing in the UK. Speaking from his own experience as minister for justice, he is well aware Ireland has always had to track UK policy given the numbers that travel via (or from) the UK to claim international protection here. Quite apart from a marked increase in numbers claiming asylum in the State since 2022, it is often overlooked that there are in the region of 1,000,000 people illegally in the UK. It is obvious that as the UK cracks down on people living illegally there, Ireland will be an increasingly attractive location for many to claim asylum, especially if people are paid to voluntarily leave if and when their asylum claims fail. A final thought is that the former minister (the only one with a sense of humour I came across in my Civil Service career) is correct when calling out the likely judicial review onslaught if we implement the EU Migration Pact next year. There is next to zero possibility of the 90-day limit for interview and possible appeal to be met, with a consequent lawyers’ bonanza at taxpayers’ expense highly likely. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL FLYNN, Bayside, Dublin 13, Sir, – Dr Eoin Drea’s recent opinion piece (“The EU presidency will show how out of touch Ireland is”, Opinion, November 13th) doesn’t quite tell the full story of Ireland’s relationship with the European Union and our upcoming EU presidency next year. Having just returned from one of my routine trips to Brussels, I met politicians and officials from across different EU countries and institutions, and I can confirm that next year’s Irish presidency of the Council of the EU is highly anticipated. Ireland has a strong track record of delivering on its EU presidencies, with some notable achievements. It may be easy to forget them but in 2013, when emerging from the financial crash, Ireland steered the EU ably through its presidency and secured the Youth Guarantee at a time of massive youth unemployment. In 2004, we welcomed 10 new EU countries in what has been the largest ever EU enlargement. Dr Eoin Drea’s observations on security and defence certainly do have merit. However, Ireland is responding. Ireland continues to stand with Ukraine. We became home to over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and have provided significant financial aid. Ireland has demonstrated strong moral leadership on the conflict in Palestine, which is desperately needed at this time. Our economic success is not rooted in “dubious facilitation”, but in political stability, an educated workforce and access to the EU single market. These factors make us the second largest net contributor per capita to the EU budget; not an insignificant contribution from a country supposedly “out of touch”. – Yours, etc, NOELLE O’CONNELL, European Movement Ireland, Dublin 2. Sir, – As suggestions are sought by Una Mullally regarding the future of Baggot St Hospital, I have one that might be consistent with Dublin’s architectural history, provide a valuable educational resource and solve a potential problem in healthcare all at a minimal cost. In her article she observes that the current dilapidated structure was designed by William George Murray, architect of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, whose father had designed the College of Surgeons building. There is a great deal to recommend that the Government restructure his Baggot St design as a modern College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland (CAI). The CAI currently operates from a house on Merion Square. With considerable ingenuity, from there it endeavours to oversee the training of more than 250 doctors in specialist training. – Yours, etc, BRIAN O’BRIEN, Kinsale, Co Cork. Sir, – Like Colm O’Brien (Letters, November 19th) I too cannot understand why Oliver Callan’s programme has been moved to accommodate David McCullagh’s Today programme. Yesterday morning Paschal Donohoe’s departure from Government was headline news on Morning Ireland. It was followed by David McCullagh’s first item – an interview with Paschal Donohoe. We now have constant talking until Louise Duffy’s show at 3pm. Please bring Louise back at noon, we need some light relief – and a female presenter! – Yours, etc, PAMELA McDONALD, Blackrock Village, Cork. Sir, – I note that we have a new Minister for Education. Last Thursday I attended the only training day I will have for the new Leaving Certificate geography course I am to begin teaching next September. There are, as yet, no sample papers. There will be no marking scheme to guide us in teaching our students when those papers do finally appear. And individual questions may not have marks attached to them, à la the reformed Junior Certificate, just to confuse students even more. They will be forced to guess how many marks for each question and how long they should spend on it. In other words, I learned nothing of value on this day. It seems futile to ask a third minister in a little over a year to review all of this urgently before the catastrophe that this reform unquestionably is begins to unfold in front of us. Especially as the previous two ministers simply stuck their fingers in their ears and refused to listen to the ideas and opinions of those of us charged with implementing this reform. But I have no choice. Someone has to at least be able to say I told you so. Plus ca change, Minister. – Yours, etc, ALAN O’CONNOR, Donnycarney, Dublin 9. Sir, – There are many elements of possible defence against aggression and invasion which are nothing to do with killing or being prepared to kill other people (Letters, November 19th). These include scuttling (destruction) of facilities, which would be of use to an invader, and “nonviolent civilian defence” which is about preparing the population for resistance and non-cooperation with an invader – or internal oppression – including hidden disobedience. Publicising these would be a deterrence to invasion. Gene Sharp’s 198 varieties of nonviolent resistance give just a small taste of what is possible. It is clear from the interrogation of Nazi generals after the second World War that they knew exactly how to deal with violence but they were at a loss when it came to non-violent resistance. Obviously it was violence which won that war for the Allies but it illustrates the power of non-violence. The 2023, State-organised Consultative Forum on International Security Policy refused to look at non-offensive defence and non-violent civilian defence which was just a part of why that was a propaganda exercise. But the wider question is how to prevent war, including nuclear war which would be the end of civilisation as we know it, and throwing us back to far worse than the stone age if we survived at all. The Irish Government seems content to add fuel to the flickering flames in Europe. We are currently looking in the wrong direction. – Yours, etc, ROB FAIRMICHAEL, Ballynafeigh, Belfast. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump urges Treasury Secretary Bessent to take Federal Reserve job

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER and JOSH BOAK WASHINGTON (AP) — For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock registers iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware

Time Published: 2025-11-19T22:06:29Z
Full Content:
Share this article BlackRock has registered a new statutory trust in Delaware under the name iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, according to records from the Delaware Division of Corporations. Delaware registrations have typically preceded formal ETF applications to the SEC in recent crypto developments. The registration comes after Nasdaq filed Form 19b-4 with the SEC to enable staking for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), allowing the ETF to stake its Ether through approved providers and classify rewards as income. However, the SEC has recently removed the requirement for 19b-4 filings for crypto exchange-traded products. Under the new generic listing standards, exchanges can now list qualifying crypto-commodity ETPs without submitting a product-specific 19b-4 rule change each time. BlackRock joins 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, all seeking to add staking to their Ethereum ETFs. Before spot ETH ETFs were approved, firms removed stakes from their applications amid concerns staking services could be treated as unregistered securities. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF is the first US Ethereum staking ETF, which offers exposure to ETH while also distributing native staking rewards to investors.

November 19, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) TORONTO, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK), today announced the estimated 2025 annual reinvested capital gains distributions for the iShares ETFs listed on the TSX or Cboe Canada. Please note that these are estimated capital gains amounts only, as of October 31, 2025. As these are estimated amounts, the final capital gains distributions may change by the Funds' December 15, 2025 or December 31, 2025, in the case of iShares Premium Money Market ETF (“CMR”), tax year-ends. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual) cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. We expect to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts, as well as the ongoing cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2025, on or about December 29, 2025. The record date for the 2025 annual distributions will be December 30, 2025, payable on January 5, 2026. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2025, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or “CDS”) in early 2026. Details regarding the estimated distribution amounts are as follows: (1) Distribution per unit amounts are in U.S. dollars for IBIT.U, XAGG.U, XAW.U, XCBU.U, XDG.U, XDU.U, XEC.U, XEF.U, XFLI.U, XMC.U, XMU.U, XQQU.U, XSHU.U, XSTP.U, XTLT.U, XTOT.U, XUS.U, XUSC.U, and XUU.U.

Factors that could cause the actual distributions to differ from the estimated distributions between now and December 15, 2025 (the iShares ETFs’ tax year end) or December 31, 2025 in the case of CMR, include, but are not limited to: the actual amounts of distributions received by the iShares ETFs; the actual amounts of capital gains generated from sales of securities; trading activity within the iShares ETFs, including buying and selling of securities; index changes which cause rebalancing within the iShares ETFs; and subscription and redemption activity.

Title: Nvidia Earnings Beat, Strong Outlook Calm Jittery Markets; Bitcoin Re-Takes $90K

Fears of an AI bubble took at least a temporary breather after Nvidia (NVDA) reported an earnings beat as well as a strong fourth quarter outlook after the close of U.S. markets on Wednesday. The chipmaker topped Wall Street’s expectations for the third quarter, reporting revenue of $57.01 billion — a 62% jump from a year earlier — as the AI investment boom continues to fuel demand for its chips. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," said CEO Jensen Huang. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially." Shares of the company were higher by 4% in after hours trading at press time. Data center revenue — arguably the biggest source of income for the firm — landed at $51.2 billion — slightly above analyst forecasts of $49.34 billion. As for the all-important outlook, NVDA sees fourth quarter revenue of $63.7-$66.3 billion against Street estimates for just $62 billion. The news for the moment has calmed particularly jittery crypto markets, sending bitcoin BTC$82,630.98 back above $90,000 after having nearly fallen through $88,000 earlier Wednesday. AI-focused crypto tokens like TAO$280.27, Near Protocol NEAR$1.9292, ICP$4.3192 and RNDR$1.7707 all rose 4%-5% following the report. Also on the move are those bitcoin mining stocks that have pivoted to AI infrastructure. These names have been on big runs higher this year, but brutally battered of late on the general tech/crypto selloff combined with fears of an AI bubble. Among the gainers Wednesday evening: IREN (IREN) up 8%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) up 11% and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) up 6%. The results reinforce Nvidia’s position at the center of the artificial intelligence supply chain. Its GPUs are critical for training large language models, powering data centers, and running machine-learning workloads across big tech companies. The firm will hold a conference call at 5pm E.T. as investors are looking for reassurance that the company’s massive bets on AI infrastructure, software tools and next-generation chips are translating into lasting revenue.

Bitcoin is down to around $88,000, falling more than 20% over the last 30 days. The crypto market as a whole today fell to $3.04 trillion—down 4.82% in 24 hours—with 95% of all coins bleeding red. The Fear and Greed Index just hit 16, the lowest reading since April, firmly in extreme fear territory. To put this in perspective: Zcash is the only coin in the top 50 by market cap managing to stay green today, squeezing out a 4% gain. And the macro picture? It's not helping. Expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut are decreasing, Bitcoin ETFs just posted their fifth consecutive day of outflows (a record $523 million from BlackRock alone just yesterday), and traders seem to be looking for a hedge as the possibility of a crypto winter in 2026 gets more serious. Meanwhile, on Myriad—the prediction market built by Decrypt's parent company Dastan—traders are positioning for more carnage. A whopping 73.3% of the money on Myriad is betting Bitcoin dumps to $85K, as opposed to pumping to $115K. As for Ethereum, Myriad users place the odds at 62% that ETH, currently trading for around $2,800, slides to $2.5K over a rally to $4K. Are they right? Here's what the charts say. Bitcoin opened today at $92,911 and promptly fell off a cliff, sliding more than 4% to its current price of $88,605. That's a $4K slip in a single day that once again pushed BTC below the psychologically critical $90K level and marked a fresh seven-month low. The technical setup is starting to look ugly. Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs, help traders identify trend direction by tracking the average price of an asset over the short, medium, and long term. When the short-term 50-day EMA falls below the long-term 200-day EMA, it typically means sellers are dominating the market structure. For Bitcoin, the 50-day EMA just crossed below the 200-day EMA, forming the dreaded "death cross" pattern that signals longer-term bearish momentum. Bitcoin is now trading well below both moving averages, which creates nasty overhead resistance that bulls need to reclaim before any meaningful recovery can begin. Here's where it gets worse: The Average Directional Index—which measures trend strength regardless of direction—is sitting at a robust 38.25. ADX readings above 25 indicate a strong trend is in place, and above 35 signals a very strong trend. This tells us the current downtrend isn't some weak, directionless chop; there's real momentum behind this selloff, as reflected in the “extreme fear” reading on the Crypto Fear and Green Index. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index, or RSI, has cratered to 27.12, firmly in oversold territory below 30. RSI measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold based on recent price movements, and at 27, Bitcoin is stretched like a rubber band. This doesn't mean the selling stops immediately, but it does suggest we're approaching exhaustion levels where a violent bounce becomes more likely. That may mean prices soon testing the support (now resistance) level that has been in place since June, visible in the chart above in the dotted white line. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which shows the market phase of prices and helps identify when trends are about to shift, is flashing bearish impulse signals, confirming the compression is releasing downward. So are Myriad predictors right in setting that $85K target? The wisdom of the crowd might be onto something. The chart shows a Fibonacci support around $84,451, with stronger support near $71,486. If Bitcoin loses the $88K-$89K zone it's currently testing, there's not much stopping a move toward $85K and below. However, that oversold RSI suggests any drop to $85K would likely be a quick wick rather than a sustained breakdown. Capitulation moves tend to reverse violently once they flush out the last of the leveraged long positions—those futures contracts betting on the price of Bitcoin to go up using borrowed capital. The upside case to $115K would require Bitcoin to reclaim the death cross and break above the descending trendline around $100,492—a tall order that explains why only 26.7% of traders are betting on it. Key levels: Resistance: Support: And if Bitcoin is in bad shape, then Ethereum has it even worse. ETH today dumped 6.73% from an opening price of $3,121.7 to close at $2,911.8, with an intraday low of $2,895.8. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's 50-day EMA is still trading above its 200-day EMA—a "golden cross" that's supposed to be bullish. So why is ETH getting destroyed? The golden cross tells you the longer-term trend structure is intact, but it doesn't protect you from brutal corrections within that trend. Ethereum is trading below both moving averages despite the golden cross, which means the bullish structure is being tested hard. Also, the setup is very likely to turn bearish soon: The two EMAs are just about to cross, so if ETH dips for a few days, you’ll have another death cross here too. And get this: Ethereum's ADX is even more extreme than Bitcoin's at 42.4. Traders would view this as a very strong trend, and right now that trend is firmly bearish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator for ETH is likewise showing bearish impulse signals What might make this particularly painful for ETH holders is that Ethereum has stronger downward momentum (higher ADX) but is also barely above oversold territory with an RSI of 30.92—just kissing the 30 threshold. This creates a knife-edge situation where the strong downtrend could push RSI deeper into oversold before reversing. The ETH chart shows support around $2,796 and stronger support near $2,300. Myriad users are again strongly favoring the downside at the moment, with nearly 67% odds that Ethereum falls to $2.5K or below, which aligns with the technical analysis. Ethereum needs to hold the $2,700-$2,800 zone (shown in the Fibonacci levels) to keep the 200-day EMA intact. If that breaks, the next meaningful support is indeed around $2,300-$2,500—exactly where most Myriad users are looking. For the 33% betting on $4K? That would require ETH to reclaim the $3,100-$3,200 zone, hold it as support, and grind through multiple resistance levels. It’s possible if macro conditions improve, but the technicals right now don't support it. Keep praying, bulls. This is crypto after all. Crazier things have happened.

Title: Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble. Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations. “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown. The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report. Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. The world’s most valuable public company has also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holders stand to be impacted by Wednesday’s results. Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks. Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market. “This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report. At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a $100 billion investment in OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back. But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Monday committed to buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants. Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure. The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google all indicated in their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang also laid out at GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars. Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Nvidia Climbs Ahead of Earnings; GE Vernova Powers Higher

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Wednesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising 2.9% to lead chip stocks higher ahead of the AI darling's highly anticipated quarterly results after the bell. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% and the Nasdaq advanced 0.6%. See here for Investopedia's full daily market summary. Shares of GE Vernova (GEV), the energy technology company spun off from GE in April 2024, surged 7.3% after the company announced its first wind repower upgrade agreement outside the U.S. Under the deal, GE Vernova will provide 25 wind repower upgrade kits, used to modernize and extend the operational life of aging wind turbines, to Taiwan Power Company. Constellation Energy (CEG) shares jumped 5.3% after the Department of Energy said it had provided a $1 billion loan to fund the utility company's plan to restart a decommissioned nuclear reactor at the Pennsylvania site formerly known as Three Mile Island. Constellation entered a deal last year with Microsoft (MSFT) to resume operations at the nuclear facility to help power the software giant's energy-intensive data centers. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) reported better-than-expected adjusted profit for the third quarter, and shares of the home improvement retailer climbed 4%. The company highlighted an increase in online sales, strength in its business with professional contractors, and growth in "home services," a program that connects customers with licensed professionals for help with installation and remodeling projects. The strong report from Lowe's came a day after rival Home Depot (HD) missed quarterly earnings forecasts and cut its outlook, citing headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the housing market. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) gained 2.8% to close at an all-time high after the tech giant launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model. Several analysts praised the newest version, saying it competes with state-of-the-art models from competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic. Wednesday's move into record territory followed gains earlier in the week after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed a stake in Alphabet. Eversource Energy (ES) stock dropped 12.5%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500, after regulators in Connecticut rejected the utility company's proposed sale of its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. The state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted unanimously to block the transaction, determining that it failed to meet the proper standards for managerial sustainability. A pair of agricultural giants came under pressure following reports that the Trump administration may delay proposed cuts to incentives for biofuel imports. Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Bunge (BG), which process commodities like corn and soybeans into biofuel, slipped 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively.

November 19, 2025 16:20 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the third quarter ended October 26, 2025, of $57.0 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and up 62% from a year ago. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 73.4% and 73.6%, respectively. For the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were both $1.30. “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.” During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA returned $37.0 billion to shareholders in the form of shares repurchased and cash dividends. As of the end of the third quarter, the company had $62.2 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on December 26, 2025, to all shareholders of record on December 4, 2025. Q3 Fiscal 2026 Summary OutlookNVIDIA’s outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO CommentaryCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

About us Copy link Beware of BlackRock and its ilk. If the world’s largest asset managers continue to accumulate Ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, at unprecedented rates, the network will face two key existential threats, according to Vitalik Buterin. Buterin spoke at a panel at the Funding the Commons side event at Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires alongside computer scientist Roger Dingledine, who co-founded the privacy software Tor Project . During the talk, attended by DL News, Buterin laid out how institutional capture could fundamentally break what makes Ethereum valuable. “How do you avoid capture by big behemoths like BlackRock?” Dingledine asked Buterin, referencing the flood of institutional interest following BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF launch. Buterin’s answer was blunt. Institutional influence creates two specific risks that could destroy Ethereum’s core purpose. The nine Wall Street firms that offer Ethereum exchange-traded funds now hold over $18 billion in Ether, while treasury companies hold an additional $18 billion on their balance sheets. Analysts, moreover, forecast that institutions could hold more than 10% of Ethereum’s entire supply in the near-term. But Buterin sees danger in that type of success. Indeed, since the arrival of Wall Street behemoths, Ethereum has faced a fundamental tension. Institutional money brings legitimacy and capital. But it also brings pressure to optimise for institutional needs — not the permissionless, censorship-resistant values that made Ethereum exciting to build on in the first place. The first risk is pretty straightforward. When BlackRock and other institutions gain too much influence, they alienate the people who actually care about decentralisation. “It easily drives other people away,” Buterin said. The core community and builders who spent years developing Ethereum’s infrastructure don’t want to build for Wall Street. They want to build transparent, permissionless systems, he explained. If Ethereum becomes primarily a tool for institutional finance, those builders could get up and leave. And without them, Ethereum loses the technical expertise and ideological commitment that keeps it decentralised. There’s a second, more concrete, threat. Institutional pressure leads to technical decisions that could break Ethereum’s accessibility. “Their existence easily leads to the wrong kinds of choices on the base layer,” said Buterin, who offered up an example: 150-millisecond block times. Faster blocks sound great for high-frequency trading and institutional applications, but they create impossible constraints for ordinary users. Worse, 150ms blocks make it “infeasible to operate a node unless you’re in NYC” — or another financial hub with ultra-low latency connections to validators. The result is ghoulish for a community predicated on decentralisation and sticking it to the man. An Ethereum optimised for Wall Street becomes an Ethereum that only Wall Street can use. That means geographic centralisation, exclusion of privacy-conscious users, and a node operator base limited to whoever can afford data centres located in Manhattan. In any case, Buterin offered a fix. “We need to focus on the things that would otherwise be in short supply: global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol,” he said. Wall Street doesn’t need Ethereum to move fast or settle trades efficiently. It has systems for that. What Wall Street can’t build — and what makes Ethereum valuable — is a truly global system that anyone can access without permission nor trust. Maintaining that requires a “strong core community that focuses on those things,” Buterin said. Not a community optimised for institutional adoption, but one committed to the values that make Ethereum different from traditional finance.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF outflow today: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF saw its largest single-day outflow of $523 million as Bitcoin plunged to a seven-month low. This significant withdrawal signals investor unease and a potential shift towards safer assets like gold, amid a broader market retreat and concerns over stretched valuations. Profit-taking and a 'crypto hangover' are also cited as contributing factors.

Title: Meta Never Bought Monopoly Power, It Simply Discovered The Future

ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. “This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard – and you’ll never be heard from again.” That’s what Michael Ovitz, long known as the most powerful man in Hollywood, told Barry Diller when the former head of both Paramount and Fox informed Ovitz of his next act in business. It was the early 1990s, and Diller sensed the future was in screens “interacting with customers.” Diller sought and achieved control over the Home Shopping Network. Media types were aghast! Diller’s time in the proverbial wilderness rates thought as you read this, and you contemplate the meaning of the dismissal of the FTC’s case against Meta. The FTC filed suit against Meta on December 8, 2020 based on Meta’s prior purchases of Instagram ($1 billion) and WhatsApp ($19 billion) in 2012 and 2014 respectively. But if there had been strong evidence in 2012 and 2014 that Meta was buying monopoly power, then the latter would have revealed itself through exponentially higher price tags for both Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s really that simple. That they both could be purchased for a fraction of their present worth is all the evidence we need that as opposed to buying monopoly control of the social media sector, Meta (Facebook at the time) was taking on substantial, possibly existential risk with its purchases. Leaps into the future are expensive, and shareholders not infrequently revolt if they’re wrong. Which brings us to Meta’s share price 15 and 13 years ago. It was higher in November of 2012 (it closed the month at $28) than it was after the purchase of Instagram ($26.81) in December of 2012. As for WhatsApp, Meta shares were down $1 a month after the purchase, and $10 by the following month. Markets are a look ahead, but as evidenced by the share-price movement of Meta after it added Instagram and WhatsApp to its suite of free offerings for users, neither impressed investors. It’s a reminder that it took the information-pregnant marketplace a long time to reward Facebook’s vision. Which is telling. The crucial truth revealed through Meta’s stock price is that Facebook couldn’t have known it was purchasing monopoly power, let alone businesses that would subsequently exceed their purchase price worth, simply because no one knew. In business, tomorrow is another century. Which similarly requires thought as this opinion piece inches toward its conclusion. It was on November 30, 2022 that a little known (at least to the public) non-profit organization called OpenAI released ChatGPT, and in doing so, profoundly changed the present and future of Silicon Valley. Since then, Meta, once thought to be a “monopoly,” has invested hundreds of billions in a frenzied attempt to yet again discover a future that changes all the time based on developments in the present. It’s yet another reminder that in Silicon Valley, there are no monopoly purchases as is. There’s just investment in an ever-changing future that’s impossible to accurately foresee. This truth seems to have informed the court proceedings in the FTC’s dismissed lawsuit against Meta. Back to Ovitz and Diller, somewhere they’re nodding their heads in agreement. Foolish as Diller’s acquisition of HSN looked at the time, it proved a vehicle for him to become a billionaire internet entrepreneur though 155 different transactions over the years whereby much disdained HSN became the much revered IAC, or InterActiveCorp. Once briefly ridiculed, Diller is now lionized. In our dynamic economy there’s no buying dominance or “monopoly,” there’s just intrepid leaps into the future. That’s what Meta successfully did in risky fashion, thus the wise dismissal of the FTC’s lawsuit.

Title: Coffee Break: Hasbara Ain’t Cheap, Musk, Ellison, Saudis, All Tapped

Time Published: 2025-11-19T19:00:53Z
Full Content:
The practitioners of Hasbara are desperately ratcheting up their control of American corporate and social media and are reportedly seeking funding from the Arab Gulf states to help. The MAGA/MIGA conflict that is splitting Trump’s Republican coalition is one factor stressing zionist narrative control, but fundamentally fallout from Gaza is driving the desperation. The increasingly precarious state of the AI bubble that’s been propping up Silicon Valley and the entire American economy is putting more pressure on the financial underpinnings of Hasbara, Inc. Holocaust Education Sending Wrong Message? Former Obama, Clinton, Kerry and Gore speechwriter Sarah Hurwitz perhaps spoke more truth than she meant to when speaking (video) at the The 2025 General Assembly of the Jewish Federations of North America. Hurwitz starts with a pretty standard condemnation of 21st Century communications, blaming social media, although it is interesting to note her definition of “mainstream” as not expressing “extreme anti-Israel views.” I think that since October 7th, but really before then, there have been huge shifts in America on how people think about Jews and Israel. And I think that is especially true of young people. So, we are now wrestling with a new, I think, generational divide here. And I think that’s particularly true in that social media is now our source of media. It used to be that the the media you got in America was American media and it was pretty mainstream. It generally didn’t express extreme anti-Israel views. You had to go to a pretty weird bookstore to find global media and fringe media. But today, we have social media, which is a global medium. It is shaped, its algorithms are shaped by billions of people worldwide who don’t really love Jews. And so, while in the 1990s, you know, a young person probably wasn’t going to find Al Jazeera or someone like Nick Fuentes, today those media outlets find them. They find them on their phones. It’s also this increasingly post-literate media, less and less text, more and more videos. So, you have Tik Tok just smashing our young people’s brains all day long with video of carnage in Gaza. And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. So I want to give data and information and facts and arguments and they are just seeing in their minds carnage and I sound obscene. It’s also noteworthy that she does not see video evidence of mass murder as something that should be weighed equally with “facts and arguments.” But the novel thing she said regarded “Holocaust education” which she characterizes as “a very smart bet that made” “in this new media environment” but is now worried that it “may be confusing some of our young people” into thinking that “anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism” and “the lesson of the Holocaust is that you fight Israel.” I’m quoting this section in full because it’s the kind of thing that would have been dismissed as anti-Semitic conspiracy theory if said by Lyndon Larouche in the 1990s. And you know, I think unfortunately the very smart bet that we made on Holocaust education to serve as anti-Semitism education in this new media environment, I think that is beginning to break down a little bit because, you know, Holocaust education is absolutely essential, but I think it may be confusing some of our young people about anti-Semitism because they learn about big strong nazis hurting weak emaciated Jews and they think, ‘Oh, anti-Semitism is like anti-Black racism, right? powerful white people against powerless black people.’ So when on TikTok all day long they see powerful Israelis hurting weak, skinny Palestinians, it’s not surprising that they think, ‘Oh, I know the lesson of the Holocaust is you fight Israel. You fight the big powerful people hurting the weak.’ Caitlin Johnstone titled her response “Zionists Are Freaking Out About Losing Control Of The Narrative” and I’ll quote a key passage: It’s just so fascinating to see a former White House speechwriter making so many of the points that anti-Zionists have been making for years, but taking the exact opposite meaning from them. … Hurwitz isn’t denying Israel’s abuses or framing its genocidal atrocities as the problem, she’s just coming right out and saying that people obtaining information and moral clarity about those abuses is the problem. The atrocities aren’t wrong, what’s wrong is people seeing those atrocities and calling them what they are. I love the way she complains that she looks “obscene” for trying to lay out arguments and narratives justifying the Gaza holocaust for people who’ve seen the “wall of carnage” from the genocide. I mean, yes. Yes obviously you’re going to look obscene if you try to tell someone why raw video footage of massacres, mutilated children and emaciated bodies is actually showing something that is justifiable and acceptable. You can’t stand in front of a pile of child corpses justifying their murder and then whine when people ignore your spinmeistering and keep staring at the tiny bodies. That’s like murdering an entire family and then telling the cops, “But you’re not listening to my reasons for killing them!” They’re doing the normal thing while you are being obscene. So yea, there’s that. Now that we’ve set the context and shown the panic driving Israel’s quest for total narrative control, let’s look at some of the tactical aspects of that quest. Taking Hasbara to Church and ChatGPT Haaretz dropped a blockbuster report ten days ago that reveals the aggressive and ambitious nature of Hasbara in 2025: The Israeli government has signed contracts worth millions of dollars in recent months to rehabilitate Israel’s standing in American public opinion, both online and offline. Amid a sharp drop in support from the conservative right, Israel has hired firms to conduct not just “hasbara [public diplomacy] campaigns” but also campaigns targeting millions of Christian churchgoers, bot networks to amplify pro-Israel messages online, and efforts to influence both search results and the responses given by popular AI services like ChatGPT. Among the experts recruited is a former campaign manager for Donald Trump and many of the other firms are linked to the Republican party or Evangelical communities, indicating that Israel is focusing massive efforts on communities once considered automatically pro-Israel. Among the campaigns’ goals is fighting antisemitism, which has risen alongside the decline in support for Israel. Together, these campaigns signal a new phase in Israel’s post-war public diplomacy strategy, and a shift in the way it uses agents – both AI and human influencers – for hasbara abroad. … Payments are routed through Havas Media Germany GmbH, a subsidiary of the international advertising and public relations giant Havas. In practice, Havas serves as an intermediary, executing contracts with U.S. firms on Israel’s behalf. The documents show that since 2018, the company has received at least $100 million to promote Israeli tourism campaigns in the United States and it also works with other countries, including several in the Gulf, on similar projects. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X, owned by Brad Parscale, who played a lead role in Trump’s digital campaigns in 2016 and 2020. The $6 million, four-month contract – signed between his firm and Havas Media on behalf of the Israeli government – calls for “strategic consulting, planning, and communications services to develop and execute a broad U.S. campaign to combat antisemitism.” According to the filing, Parscale’s company will produce “at least 100 core pieces of content per month” – including videos, audio, podcasts, graphics and text – and “5,000 derivative versions” monthly, aiming for 50 million impressions a month. Eighty percent of the content will target young Americans on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. Campaign messages will be distributed via Salem Media Network, a conservative Christian media group that owns more than 200 radio stations and websites. Parscale was appointed this year to lead Salem’s strategy. Lucrative work if you can get it and don’t mind a little blood on your fangs hands. The American Conservative has more details on the Salem Media aspect of this caper: Salem Media, one of America’s largest conservative media conglomerates, may have already begun integrating paid-for Israeli government narratives across its extensive network of platforms. The arrangement, formalized through a seven-figure contract, raises significant questions about the intersection of foreign influence on an increasingly fracturing conservative media environment. Salem did not respond to The American Conservative’s request for comment. In September, the Israeli government retained Salem Media’s chief strategy officer, Brad Parscale, to advocate for Israeli interests through a $6 million financial arrangement. The contract filed with the Department of Justice explicitly outlines the “integration of narrative messaging into Salem Media Network properties and aligned distribution channels” as one of its key deliverables. Salem Media operates 82 radio stations across the United States and manages high-profile websites like Townhall and RedState that serve as influential platforms in shaping conservative discourse. Salem also hosts multiple podcasts featuring prominent voices in the conservative movement. Among those programs are The Charlie Kirk Show, The Dinesh D’Souza Podcast, The Josh Hammer Show, and The Right View with Lara Trump. According to company data, the network generates 80 million monthly website page views with 37 million monthly app visits. Salem’s newsletter operation reaches 4 million active subscribers, delivering 310 million newsletters every month, and also touts 44 million “fans” on Facebook. Parscale now serves dual roles: advancing Salem’s business interests while simultaneously working as a registered and compensated foreign agent for Israel. The implications extend to Salem’s roster of prominent commentators, particularly Dinesh D’Souza and Josh Hammer, who have become central figures in an escalating debate within conservative circles about America’s relationship with Israel and role in the Middle East policy more broadly. But Parscale can’t do it all alone. Musk’s X No Longer Translating Hebrew Clearly this is a time to leave no stone unturned for Team Hasbara, so they mopped up an embarrassing detail this week, or maybe Elon Musk did it all on his own out of his sincere concern about anti-Semitism. I’ll let Grok explain: Translation from Hebrew was disabled because it often amplified inflammatory or policy-violating content, like calls for violence, to a global audience via inaccurate or literal renditions. X prioritizes free speech for opinions but limits features that exacerbate harm without… — Grok (@grok) November 16, 2025 As to why Elon Musk might think this was necessary, here’s one example translated from the Hewbrew: pic.twitter.com/yDseDDhbg2 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 TikTok Is Now a Zionist Free Speech Zone While it’s not entirely clear that a new ownership consortium including Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz have completed their takeover of TikTok (based on I don’t believe anything Trump 2.0 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant says and he’s the one saying the deal is done), what is clear is that their new Public Policy Manager, Hate Speech, Erica Mindel is on the J-O-B. Before we look at Mindel’s work, let’s review what’s been reported about the new owners, via Forbes: Software giant Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and MGX, an AI-focused investment firm established by the government of Abu Dhabi, are expected to own around 45% of the new TikTok. Silver Lake also has significant ties to the Gulf States with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. owning 5% of the VC firm. But let’s get back to Erica Mandel and her work at Tik Tok, via Mel the Village Crazy Lady: Remember that time that Congress held a billion hearings on “antisemitism on TikTok” because people were sharing videos from Gaza? Well now that Zionists own the platform, this is what their spaces sound like: https://t.co/cH2hE2pSyK pic.twitter.com/jRJqFT5EUp — Mel (@Villgecrazylady) November 18, 2025 Both videos feature a man identified as “Older Millennial” who is indulging in grossly eliminationist rhetoric like “if we leave a scrap of Palestinian DNA in Gaza…”, “if we destroy everything in Gaza what will be the loss to mankind”, and in the top video he proposed issuing “hunting licenses” to those wishing to murder Palestinians in Gaza. Cleansing Tik Tok of Pro-Palestinian Voices Lest you think Mindel has been idle, since she came on board Tik Tok no longer serves up anything in response to searches for Nick Fuentes, and is “banning users from calling the IDF “terrorists” and rolling out automated moderation that retroactively wipes posts. Users report “Free Palestine” comments disappearing in real time and Israeli war-crimes videos taken down” per Drop Site News. Glenn Greenwald spoke to Guy Christensen, an American advocate for Gaza and Tik Tokker with 3.5 million followers on the platform about the new Hasbara regime on the site. The 19-year-old Christensen explains that prior to October 7, 2023, he was a non-political poster on the platform with over 2 million followers when “my feed was flooded with pro-Israel propaganda dehumanizing Palestinians. And me having no prior knowledge about Israel was shocked. I was disgusted by what I was hearing, not like not knowing anything. And, that shock provoked me to dig into the reality of Gaza.” Christensen was “disenrolled” from Ohio State University in May after completing his freshman year. The univeristy claimed it “received ‘myriad communications’ from ‘members of the university community’ expressing their ‘fear of violence and for their personal safety based on (Christensen’s) social media posts.’ Christensen blames Attorney General Pam Bondi and Democratic Congressman Richie Torres, among others, for driving his expulsion. The ACLU has taken up Christensen’s cause in a lawsuit. But back to our topic, regarding the new Tik Tok policies Christensen says: They mandate that people have to condemn terrorist groups designated by the US State Department, when mentioned in any videos, even when mentioned in a neutral, investigative context. They opened the door to classifying anti-Israel speech as hate speech based on their new clause about national origin. They ban the reading of manifestos. They restrict videos from the feed that show videos from war, aka Gaza. And so I’ve been forced and other people have been forced to stop showing real footage, real imagery from the destruction of the Palestinian nation in the Gaza Strip. As soon as these uh changes went into effect, my videos started getting banned or removed from the recommendation feed left and right. And to kind of put this into perspective, over the last, you know, almost 2 years before these changes, as I was posting consistently about Palestine every single day, there’s only been a handful of videos that I’ve ever gotten removed. I looked and over the last year prior to September 13th, it was one or two that you could even count. So very quickly (after the new policies were implemented) I racked up about 10 violations either (videos) removed completely without any recourse to appeal or they were shadowbanned. I would get like um 100 views from people who only went directly to my profile to view it and my fellow collaborators fellow people in the movement on TikTok, I reached out to them and they reported back the same exact thing. Many accounts other than Christensen’s, including Breaking Points Krystal Ball, have been throttled, banned, or shadowbanned on Tik Tok since Mindel took over “hate speech” on the platform. No one is even bothering to pretend that Chinese manipulation of the algorithm, the ostensible reason the platform was banned by the U.S. Congress, was really a concern. Rather the Washington Post handwrings about the 17-to-1 preponderance of pro-Palestinian videos vs pro-Israel videos on the platform. The hasbara happens out in the open now. The Ellisons Have Been Busy Hasbara Elves at Paramount Since I last updated about David Ellison (Larry’s nepo-baby) and Paramount, the team has been busy cracking down on free speech. Per Variety: An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. … Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. [Update, Nov. 7: Other sources intimately familiar with Paramount said that while an itemized list does not exist, the management team shares a set of values and has no desire to work with anyone who expresses hate in public and damaging ways]. Bari Weiss’ takeover at CBS News is also getting press, from Puck at the end of October: she has had real discussions about the feasibility of their transfer. Her targets have included Fox News anchors Bret Baier, Bill Hemmer, and Dana Perino, as well as CNN analyst Scott Jennings; and, as I reported earlier this week, she has also discussed expanding Anderson Cooper’s role at the network beyond 60 Minutes. In an industry where talent acquisition has its own set rules of engagement, Bari’s instinctive and freewheeling approach has struck many as unorthodox. To many TV news veterans, it is also seen as a sign of her inexperience and lack of managerial finesse. Network executives lock their talent into yearslong contracts—Anderson’s runs through 2026, Bret’s into 2028, and Dana’s into the 2030s—and include specified negotiation windows that don’t open until the final three to six months of the agreement. Savvier network leaders tend to re-up their stars before that window ever opens. Getting out of these contracts isn’t impossible, of course, but it doesn’t happen on a whim—and it usually requires quite a bit of discretion. The casual, D.I.Y. approach is very on brand for Bari, and presumably one of the reasons that David Ellison brought her in to disrupt the business. In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict. (On Friday, Trump sat down with Norah O’Donnell for his first interview on the network since he sued 60 Minutes.) Paramount Alone Isn’t Enough But Paramount is small beans in the overall media picture, which explains the Ellisons’ drive to acquire WBD (Warner Bros Discovery). Keep in mind, streaming has completely upended the American media business. The lumbering titans that bought up most of the nation’s TV networks and movie studios are getting pwned by Netflix and Alphabet’s YouTube. pic.twitter.com/fqYJtLxYmu — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Let’s hear from The New York Times regarding Paramount’s efforts to acquire WBD: Over the course of four weeks, Paramount made three offers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, ratcheting up the financial stakes of a deal that would reshape the media landscape. … The move essentially kicked off a public frenzy of interest from other potential suitors this week, including Comcast and Amazon. If they bid, that could pressure Paramount to further increase its offer. Warner Bros. Discovery said on Tuesday that it was initiating a sale because of “the unsolicited interest of multiple parties” for both some parts and all of the company. Paramount’s first bid was for $19 a share, before moving up to $22 in late September. Paramount’s latest bid was delivered on Oct. 13, offering to pay the company’s shareholders $23.50 a share in cash and stock, according to the letter. That offer represented an 87 percent premium to Warner Bros. Discovery’s share price before its intent to make a bid for the company was first reported on in early September. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. shares closed at $20.53. A takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount would be a tectonic shift for the media industry. It would combine two of the largest Hollywood studios, Warner Bros. and Paramount, granting huge clout at the box office and putting CNN and CBS News under the same corporate umbrella, which would give the new company enormous sway over the news industry. It would combine Paramount+ and HBO Max, two of the biggest streaming services, bringing the company’s movies and shows into hundreds of millions of living rooms. According to Variety (in a report which Paramount denies), Paramount is “putting together a $71 billion bid for WBD in conjunction with funds from three Arab countries: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).” Regarding Paramount’s denial, one media insider reports: Sources familiar with the talks say the connections behind that capital did not appear on their own. Ari Emanuel has long standing ties across Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, and he publicly supported Ellison’s previous Paramount effort. Paramount issued a denial, but multiple industry sources confirmed that a holding company structure allows outside capital to participate without ever appearing on Paramount’s balance sheet. I’ve previously posted on Ari Emanuel’s involvement in the Ellisons’ acquisition of Paramount. Yahoo Finance had more on the wheeling and dealing going on in the Trump White House this week while the POTUS is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (and cutting some private Trump organization deals of their own): Elon Musk, Tim Cook, golfer Bryson DeChambeau and other notables will join Ellison at a black-tie dinner held in the Saudi royal’s honor, a person familiar with the guest list tells Deadline. Earlier Tuesday, Trump met with Cristiano Ronaldo, the soccer star who recently re-upped his $200 million-a-year contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr. Ronaldo was also on the guest list for the dinner. A Variety report, citing anonymous sources, said a coalition involving Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, had formed in support of a forthcoming $71 billion bid by Paramount for WBD, which would be a notch higher than prior bids in the $60 billion-plus range. Now why would David Ellison need to go to the Gulf States to fund his hasbara? Maybe Daddy’s company Oracle is having some financial issues? Oracle Doesn’t Have Infinite Money CNBC reports that Oracle has lost one third of its market cap since September and is issuing $38 billion in debt to “finance its AI buildout”. Reuters is reporting that investor sentiment on that Oracle debt is bearish: Oracle bonds have taken a hit in recent days following a report that the cloud and artificial intelligence service provider plans to add another $38 billion to its heavy debt load to fund its AI infrastructure, according to analysts and investors. … “What’s interesting is most of the (major tech) companies are trying to sustain their (stock) buyback programs at the same time that they’re spending on capex currently and to do that, they’re actually borrowing and so they’re using debt,” said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The price of Oracle’s bonds maturing in 2033 with a 4.9% coupon has dipped, pushing yields up more than three basis points over the last two weeks, while the yield on its newer bonds maturing in 2032 with a 4.8% coupon has risen almost two basis points in one week, according to market participants. And The Financial Times put out a doozy of a report asserting that “Oracle’s net debt is already at 2.5 times ebitda, having more than doubled since 2021, and it’s expected to nearly double again by 2030. Cash flow is forecast to remain negative for five straight years.” The piece included several charts, including this particularly brutal one: pic.twitter.com/TTs0b2Q1Hw — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 19, 2025 Time will tell if the Ellisons’ hasbara-promoting media empire will grow even larger, but at the moment it appears to be on the proverbial knife’s edge.

And this is why so many of us can’t have a sane conversation with younger Jews because anything that we try to say to them, they are hearing it through this wall of carnage. Good on the younger Jews. Don’t let the old fuckers gaslight you into believing up is down. I think Nassim Taleb is right about social media being more a return to common sense and a two way debate than the programmed propaganda of traditional media. Ideas and opinions have to stand on their merits and against the opinions of others. People are freer to hold their own views on social media. Ultimately most people are reasonable, and know right from wrong. Essentially, Israel and its foreign assets are freaking out because the heretofore wildly successful color revolution In the US is being challenged. Where’s Waldo? Noting: “In her very first days at the network, she made an impression on staff by personally texting major guests—Bibi Netanyahu, Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, Hillary Clinton, Condi Rice—to book them for segments on the Israel-Gaza conflict.” Hilary. What are you doing in that group? Grifting again? Blabbering about how stupid your Columbia students were? Special cameo appearance, too, by gay icon Tim Cook. Ahhh, role models. Time to throw some to the flames. ” Time to throw some to the flames.” Or, as an unrepentant misogynist I knew once put it: “Time for a good old fashioned Auto da Fem.” Yes, if you want to do “cutting edge” deals, bin Salman is the one to see. The first thing I remember watching about the Jews in WWII when I was pretty young was the TV movie The Wall, which at the time I thought was a dramatic retelling of history, but that I now recognize as hasbara. It came out in 1982, which I’ve come to learn is about the time Israeli propaganda really kicked into high gear. My understanding (and older commenters, please correct me if I’m wrong here) is that before the 70s or so, WWII was looked upon as a great tragedy for the whole world, but not as a war specifically fought to persecute and murder Jewish people. Millions of Jews died, but many millions more Russians and Chinese did too, among others. Plenty of misery to go around. It wasn’t until a few decades after the war that Israel developed the narrative that the war was about them and their special grievances in order to justify allowing the Israeli government to get away with whatever it wanted to with impunity. Yes, Nazi Germany killed millions more of Russians in battle than Jews, but the extermination camps created by the Nazis were primarily intended for Europe’s Jewish population. WWII was not about the Jews, but it is incontrovertible that Nazi Germany attempted to exterminate all of European Jewry. Systematically rounding up a population and sending them by rail to gas chambers for extermination was an atrocity never before seen in war. That said, what Germany did to the Jews in WWII does not excuse Israel for what is has done in Gaza. Don’t forget the gays and the Romani people. They too were Nazi “untermenchen” As well as various “defective” people supposedly polluting the gene pool…. Agreed. War is hell and gives people the excuse to justify atrocities. There are no clean ones fought by ‘the rules’. There were 1 million+ Greeks ethnically cleansed from Anatolia during WWI and that’s not even on most people’s radar, and wouldn’t be on mine if not for some partial Greek heritage. Genocide against Jews in WWII wasn’t the first in history, and the current Zionist entity is proving beyond doubt that it wasn’t to be the last. But the way these various horrific events are referred to in today’s Western society is very different. Those who comprise the Zionist entity which puts out the hasbara Nat discusses, where the problem isn’t the wholesale slaughter of other human beings but the negative PR, are a psychologically damaged people. There’s a lot hanging on the terms “rail” and “gas chambers” in that statement, but it is incontrovertibly true the Nazis would have been quite happy if the Jews had all shipped off to Anywheresville as long as it wasn’t anywhere in Europe. The American genius was to genocide the indigenous populations without recourse to neither rail nor gas but nontheless providing the basic conceptual model for the subsequent Nazi experiment with Slavs, Gypsies and Jews. However, the most successful genocide in European history, ie, no survivors, is that of the Cathars whose frenzied slaughter was led by none other than that champion of the oligarchy as the governing principle of England, and by extension the US, Simon de Montfort, after whom an English university is named. Simon de Montfort, famous for his role in Parliamentary history, was a younger son of the crusader also called, Simon de Montfort. The younger Simon, being a younger son conceded the family’s French seat to his older brother, but received family support for laying at least partial claim to the title and lands of the Earl of Leicester, which the elder had had a claim to through his mother, a Beaumont. Both Simons played a part in the Magna Carta. Simon, the genocidaire and fifth earl of Leicester, was protecting his interests in 1215, and his son, the sixth earl of Leicester, was both a crusading genocidaire in Gascony, like his dad, but his brother-in-law, Henry III, was none too happy about it and, ultimately, after going on another crusade and coming home to a bit of turmoil, defeated Henry in 1264, called parliament in 1265 and promptly got himself killed at Evesham in the same year. Both men, it seems, were rat’s arses who got off on killing people with different beliefs. Very few of the 12 million Soviet civilian victims died in the battles, they were tortured, labored and starved to death unless just executed as an example. They were not collected to camps, just driven inside their churches and burned. In Belarus alone Germans erased over 600 villages completely (with their inhabitants) and partially destroyed over 5000. All and all the number of destroyed villages was over 70,000. The very concept of “lebensraum” included only the raum, not the people leben there at the time. That was only for the “Aryans”. It was a purposeful, genocidal, on-site ethnic cleansing. Under General Plan Ost, the Slavs of the Eastern Front (Poland, Ukraine, Baltics, Russia) were also intended to be exterminated, by a combination of killings, working to death and restricting their food. A small remainder were to be enslaved. In this respect, the concentration and extermination camps were laboratories for a much greater programme of Slavic extermination. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost The justification claimed by Israel could be claimed by Poland and the Ukraine and Russia too…. I remember even in the early-mid 80s most WWII programs were more tilted towards the Pacific rather than European theatre. Probably because the US was pretty much solo there. I think it was the xian/born again stranglehold of the 80s that really cemented the zionazi mentality. Afterall, Reagan was a firm believer in jesus returning after jews went back to israel…so the xians can then convert or kill them all. I can’t speak for the 1970s vs. the 1980s, but I do know that by the 1990s a lot of “new” narratives about World War 2 were so entrenched, that anyone going up against them, including unwittingly, was getting blacklisted by both media and academia. Norman Finkelstein (“The Holocaust Industry”) comes to mind, but it wasn’t just hasbara-related; I recommend “History Wars” (from 1996!!) for a great summary of the scandal manufactured around the Smithsonian’s attempt to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombings. Meanwhile, this apparently had not been the case in the 1960s, based on what’s in the older history books, e.g. William Shirer’s “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich”. So somewhere between the 60s and the 90s the switch must have gotten flipped. Insofar as the numbers. Nazi Germany was responsible for >20 million civilian and PoW deaths – ~18 million in the Soviet Union, including 3 of the 6 million Holocaust victims (which are hardly ever mentioned in “Holocaust literature”, by the way), plus 3 million of the non-Soviet Holocaust victims, >1 million in Poland, and at least hundreds of thousands if not a million plus in former Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Plus French resistance and the like, so maybe the figure is closer to 25 million. But it’s not just that, it’s the shift in focus. I watched a fascinating lecture a few years ago, where a guy just took the tourist brochures at the Auschwitz museum from different eras, and compared them. The one from the 1950s was a 200 page book (!!), explaining in detail how the Nazis came to power, why they murdered >20 million people, the whole history of the Holocaust specifically, but including how German industrialists profited from it (by working to death those Jews who were not sent to the gas chambers immediately), and on and on and on. The brochure from the 2020s? Three or so large format pages with more pictures than text, the sum of which comes down to – Hitler was evil for the sake of evil, and hated Jews because he hated Jews, and exterminated 6 million of them thusly, the end. Now, it isn’t just the effect of hasbara specifically – but that’s part of it, because if you start describing German settler colonialism, someone is bound to ask the question of how Israel’s settler colonialism is different, aside from specific tactics chosen. To be sure, it isn’t all bad in Thick History Book Land (just more bad than good). But that’s not where the great majority of the populace is, hence TikTok and CBS-WB… Germany in WWII mostly observed the Geneva Conventions with regard to POWs in the West, but embarked on exterminationist policies against the Soviets. At least 1.3 million Soviets held as POWs were murdered quite apart from battle deaths. Cold War propaganda distorted narratives of WWII atrocities in general. The firebombing of Dresden (in the Soviet zone of occupation so the evidence was in Soviet custody) for example “expanded” in Soviet propaganda by an order of magnitude to 200,000 dead. For the Americans, Stalin’s crimes had to be lumped into the common basket of “totalitarianism”. Local complicity and resistance made for morally complex stories coming from France, the Netherlands, fascist Italy and Papal Rome, Denmark, Hungary, Poland and as we are all now aware, Ukraine. I think awareness of the holocaust assumed all of its contradictory parts at least from the last days of WWII, but was layered over with many salient events and retellings, including movies and books and news events. Zionists were sure they had the answer even in the 1930s. The cynical reaction of Norman Finkelstein or John Mearsheimer began to emerge in the late 20th century. Kudos for a great round-up. Timely and important. My pleasure. Been meaning to get back to this topic but Mamdani and the MAGA civil war have been eating up my slots. Ditto Sunshine. Forwarding. Ditto Ditto Much appreciated NWT! Interesting to see the name Havas Media here helping with the Hasbara effort. The current owner, Bolloré, is a far right French industrialist billionaire who’s been accumulating propaganda outlets by buying out and then transforming formerly traditionally center left or left French media over the past decade or so into bilious anti Muslim and far right French Catholic (a huge subject) outlets to manipulate French opinion. The journalists that come with the acquisitions are unionized and fight with the few legal means at their disposal (it’s a strangely regulated profession) until they eventually just quit. Havas itself was built on money generated from the cotton trade, when it was produced by slavery, first in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and after the revolution in Brazil. Dirty money seems to stain permanently. Or in Balzacian terms “Derrière chaque grande fortune se cache un crime”. The largest of the new hasbara contracts was signed in August with a firm called Clock Tower X Sure makes me wonder about the Kirk assassination. Curious for it to happen as the hasbara rubber is hitting road. Here in Michigan as in several other states genocide, the Holocaust/ Jewish genocide and Armenian genocide are required to be taught in the public schools. There is a panel to approve the content. I have written those responsible for overseeing this as well as my state legislators as well Congresswoman Tlaib’s office to suggest that the Gaza genocide be added to the program. I received no responses. I managed to get myself blocked from further posting or commenting on Substack, since this; https://johnmerryman.substack.com/p/gods-problems Given my problems are not about politics, ethnicities, or any of the social and cultural branding, but the basic conceptual foundations of Western Civ, in this case, monotheism, I don’t really have a problem with the hasbara, as it is turning the entire media system into used toilet paper and sucking the political flunkies down with it. Ask yourself, is God Spirit, or Authority? They are not synonymous….. Democracy and republicanism originated in pantheistic cultures. And here I was thinking I might be allowed to express myself on substack. Thanks for disabusing me of that fantasy. The hasbara was happening long before the ’80’s. I remember the “making the desert bloom” hasbara coming in the late ’50’s. No mention of Zionists taking inventory of the best farms in Palestine in the ’30’s and ’40’s to be acquired (stolen) after 1948. Historian Illan Pape writes about that from actual records. There was a plan, it was implemented with German efficiency and explained as something else. What was that Goebbels said about repeating a lie frequently enough? a link would be great, I did a quick search and found this but if a person knew a more relevant to comment link that would be better, not a criticism per se, but more the farther down the pilot hole, the easier to set the screw… https://www.stopthejnf.org/the-jnf-the-principal-zionist-tool-for-the-colonization-of-palestine-by-ilan-pappe/ this is from 2023, earlier might be better A useful link might be Leon Uris’ novel, “Exodus,” published in 1958. That was the year I graduated high school and I read it and loved it. So inspiring! “Exodus” the film was released in 1960. Starring …. swoon ….. Paul Newman! One of the most effective propaganda films ever. By the time I graduated college in 1962, most of my friends were seriously considering spending time on Israeli communes, to help make ‘the desert bloom.’ It was decades later that I learned about the 1948 Nakba, the expulsion of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and farms, from the reading I did after 9/11, especially a small book by I.F. Stone. Yes, with the lyrics to the Schlockmeister theme song – “This land is mine/ God gave this land to me” – written by the uber-Goyishe pop star, Pat Boone, of all people. tegnost – here is a link to an excellent overview of “Blaming the Victims”, a book published in 1988 about myths connected to the founding of Israel. https://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/28th-may-1988/28/it-takes-two-to-tell-the-truth My parents were living in the Lebanon at that time, and did volunteer relief work with Palestinian refugees. They met many who had been driven from their homes at gunpoint. They were surprised to get home and hear that the Nakba happened because Arab leaders had broadcast instructions to Palestinians to flee their homes. That’s one of the myths addressed in the essay. It may be that since the Zionists took over Tik Tok, that it will just become another Bluesky meaning an echo chamber which the kids will just abandon. There may even be lingering resentment by those kids how their Tik Tok was taken off them and just become another Hasbara outlet courtesy of the government. The Zionists may have taken over CBS News too but when you get down to it, how many kids gets their info from CBS News in the first place? I would have figured their audience to be a much older cohort. So what will the Zionists do? Sure they will try to make all those atrocity videos be disappeared down a Memory Hole but I would not be surprised if they eventually tried to convince people that all those atrocity videos are just AI videos and that nothing ever happened. It’s all the work of Hamas don’tcha know? The civilization gods are bigger than the tribal gods. Even if the tribal gods ruled for hundreds of thousands of years and the civilization gods for only the least several thousand. The Golden Rule is a better long term strategy than Kill all the Amaleks, because what goes round, comes round. This is close to my thinking on how this will play out. The fact the Israeli system and friends are resorting to it while otherwise digging a deeper hole adds to a theory of mine: When the Israelis got a Jewish state, most of them rapidly traded in the proverbial “yiddishe kop”. On a related note, I think there’s an even deeper reason it won’t work, and I’ve been surprised that nobody else seems to have expressed it yet. For several reasons, I don’t post much on Gaza and Israel, but I think almost everyone is misdiagnosing why youth support for Israel, especially in the US, is collapsing. Gaza has definitely accelerated things, and also stripped away much of the Jewish claim to special treatment after the Holocaust. But the clouds could part tomorrow, the Palestinians and Israelis could make peace, with everything between them forgiven… and all but the most clueless younger American would carry on a simmering ill will towards Israel. Gaza is not the prime mover. The deeper rupture is only now presenting openly, still jumbled up and expressed in inchoate ways, but to put it simply, a blood debt has been incurred. America vis-a-vis Israel, regardless of how Israel justifies it in its own interests. This has nothing to do with anti-Semitic bigotry (though some will make tactical alliances and unfortunately many may drift into it). All one has to do is look at any American political issue in my lifetime that touched on “our future”, then ask which side the Israeli body politic actively enabled. New owners trying to buy up or cut down media channels as quick as they spring up is Sisyphean enough. Beyond any platform though, people in this country will keep the score in their own lives, and all but the most irredeemable suckers will conclude that Israel treats the average American as an enemy. And someday America will return the favor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnJucRfS_ig Nah man, my mom’s on woowoo. > my mom’s on woowoo. LOL #ExactlyThis Thanks again Nat, for this breakdown! @allbrt: I wwas wondering where in the hierarchy of visited sites TikTok sits … • According to semrush.com, TikTok is not even in the Top 20 in the United States. It’s 16th if you open up to the entire globe. • Across multiple stat tracking entities, TikTok settles somewhere around 17th in popularity. So I guess #T3amZ10ni5M paid a whole lotta money to get the 17th to 20-something-th most popular site to push their propaganda … FWIW, a lot of the content making waves in on YT now. YouTube, by comparison, in #2. I was going to mention how most of that top 20 was generic or shopping related, so not that relevant in shaping opinions….. but then I noticed that DDG is now bigger than either Twitter (X) or Bing!!! When did that happen? And Yahoo is somehow still alive!?! (these days, I’ll take whatever glimmers of hope I can find : ) I was surprised as well. I guess one may want to filter to social network sites since that’s where the Hasbara is focused. YouTube is not technically a social-networking site, but since the rise of its Shorts, I think you kinda have to include it since Tik-Tok exists basically as a short-video site. If we change the filter to global (so Tik-Tok shows up in the top 20), and filter out non-social-networking sites, you get: Site – Visits YouTube – 49B Facebook – 10B Instagram – 6B Reddit – 5B X – 4B Tik-Tok – 2B So the 6th largest Social Networking presence globally, but 25 times less visits than YT, and 5 times less than FB. Some big Boomer/GenX energy still out there … LOL #MyMomsOnWooWoo Why would Arab states want to fund hasbara? And famously, Smotrich said it might be moral to starve 2 million Palestinians. That might sound unfriendly, but don’t you dare compare him to that moustache guy. He only said 2 million instead of 6 million, so it’s not the same thing at all. https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/middleeast/israeli-minister-smotrich-starve-gazans-intl/ Kind of in the same spirit, I can’t help but notice how much Matt Taibbi seems to have realized who his (heftily paying audience – at least for Substack – $10/month!) really is. https://www.racket.news/p/the-jeffrey-epstein-story-is-beginning So now the whole Epstein affair is another Russiagate. Whatever keeps those new right-wing subscribers clicking and paying, I guess? Though his deterioration, moral and professional, has been apparent for years now, it’s still sad. Once upon a time, he was a good reporter. Of all these, I think the TikTok thing will be most effective. I’d guess that very few young ‘uns will dump TikTok over this as it won’t affect their main usage needs (dances or whatever they are up to). So TikTok will continue, just without informing the kids about the Zionist genocide. Sure, some will follow it by other means but a lot will just slip back into ignorance.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow of $523 million on Nov. 18, extending a five-day streak of redemptions totaling $1.425 billion as Bitcoin tests levels below $90,000. Investors pulled approximately $523 million from BlackRock‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Nov. 18, marking the fund’s largest outflow since its debut in January 2024, according to data from Farside Investors. This significant withdrawal comes amid a broader decline in Bitcoin BTC $85 758 24h volatility: 7.2% Market cap: $1.71 T Vol. 24h: $102.00 B prices, which recently reached a seven-month low. The ETF price rose slightly at the beginning of Nov. 19, but at the time of publication, it was down by more than 3%. IBIT price | Source: Yahoo! Finance The record outflow continued a trend of sustained withdrawals from Bitcoin ETFs, representing the fifth consecutive day of net redemptions. In total, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has shed $1.425 billion in capital over this period. November is shaping up to be the worst month for Bitcoin ETFs, with cumulative outflows surpassing previous monthly records. While BlackRock’s IBIT experienced record outflows, other Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and Franklin Templeton’s ETF (EZBC), recorded inflows of $139.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, on Nov. 18. According to Reuters, this divergence suggests that some investors may be shifting to alternative Bitcoin investment vehicles even as broad risk aversion persists. Bitcoin’s price decline to less than $90,000, down approximately 30% from its October high above $126,000, has coincided with increased selling pressure in ETFs. On Nov. 19, the Bitcoin price is testing again levels below $90,000, with 24-hour trading volume 42% lower. At $89,620 per BTC, it represents another 4.30% dip in a day. Bitcoin price | Source: TradingView Analysts note that the average purchase price for spot Bitcoin ETF buyers is around $90,146, suggesting many investors are either breaking even or incurring losses at current levels, possibly prompting redemptions. Despite this week’s heavy withdrawals, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust remains the leading Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, with $87.63 billion as of Nov. 19. The fund had seen strong inflows in the months before this sell-off, accumulating nearly $25 billion from March through October 2025.

Please reload this page. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page. Hero Subtitle: The Heroes who brought you Internet Privacy Terminal: man cypherpunks These are the heroes that built the tools to protect us all. They showed that cryptography is a quiet declaration of freedom. The tools we rely on today came from those who refused to accept that freedom and privacy were negotiable. They built the infrastructure of independence, and in doing so, gave us a free world. Cryptography is a declaration. The people in these halls built systems that defied states. They wrote code when cryptography was treated as contraband. They stood for individual rights long before most understood that a battle was underway. They are the quiet heroes we never deserved. "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and we're going to write it." - Eric Hughes We remember them, and we thank them, for the freedoms their code made possible, and for the ones it allows us to defend. The fathers of freedom understood they were in a world ruled by law but governed by control. They knew that without privacy, freedom was theater. So they built tools no one else understood, that would become the arsenal of the free. John Gilmore ⭐ - Visionary co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), he championed digital privacy and fought government surveillance through landmark activism and litigation. Instrumental in launching the Cypherpunks mailing list, he fostered a global community dedicated to advancing cryptography and resisting censorship. Gilmore was a key supporter of the GNU Project, free software, and open encryption, and his iconic phrase, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it", encapsulates the cypherpunk ethos of resilience and decentralization. His advocacy for strong cryptography and opposition to export controls helped shape the legal and technical landscape for privacy tools. Wikipedia Perry Metzger ⭐ - Co-founder of the Cypherpunks mailing list, he catalyzed the global exchange of ideas on privacy, digital cash, and anonymous communication, directly influencing the development of remailers and practical cryptographic tools. An early advocate for strong encryption, he bridged theoretical cryptography and real-world implementation, providing technical infrastructure and thought leadership that helped shape the cypherpunk movement's pragmatic approach to digital freedom, censorship resistance, and privacy-by-design. American Scientist They took math too pure to weaponize and did it anyway, proving that ideas can defend people and laying the foundations for all cypherpunks. They refused to let banks be the gatekeepers of freedom. They turned cryptography into money and math into trust. The world called it digital currency. They called it independence. They took the promise of cryptography and made it run at scale. Code became infrastructure. Privacy became practical. Every packet encrypted became a quiet act of resistance, that just works. They knew the risks and spoke anyway. They paid in freedom to show us the truth. The Translators. They built the culture that made privacy a cause instead of a feature. The Courtroom Warriors. They battled the state on its own turf. They translated code into arguments and turned resistance into precedent. They built nations of the mind. From ideals to infrastructure, they mapped the blueprint for digital civilization itself, redefining the social contract, designing systems where citizenship, governance, and value flow across networks, not borders. The Foundation. Before cypherpunks, there were the pioneers who built the substrate of freedom itself. They designed the OS layer that made the rest possible. Everything began with them. Complex Legacies. Builders who carried the mission forward through the system and sometimes against it. Not without controversy, andn ever without consequence. This hall will never be complete. The fight for privacy doesn't end, it evolves. Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight, someone is writing code to protect people they'll never meet. Someone is proving that technology can serve freedom. if (you.value_privacy) { cypherpunk(you); } The people in this hall showed us that cryptography is freedom. They proved that a few determined keyboard warriors with conviction can become the greatest heroes of the free world. You're next. Infrastructure for freedom. Code for sovereignty. These projects are weapons bringing both freedom of speech and defense against surveillance. They're proof that decentralized systems can work. They're the infrastructure layer of digital freedom. Because when you write code that liberates people, you’re programming the future. liberation() The mathematical breakthroughs that made everything else possible. These are the protocols that turned cryptography from an academic curiosity into a tool for mass liberation. The Anonymity Layer. Privacy requires anonymity. These projects hide who you are, who you're talking to, and what you're saying. I2P (Invisible Internet Project) - Anonymous overlay network enabling censorship-resistant communication, I2P employs garlic routing to bundle multiple encrypted messages, enhancing metadata resistance beyond traditional onion routing. It powers privacy-preserving hidden services, anonymous browsing, secure email, decentralized file sharing, and peer-to-peer applications, fostering a robust ecosystem for activists, journalists, and users seeking digital freedom. By decentralizing infrastructure and resisting surveillance, it advances cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Wikipedia Mixmaster / Mixminion - Pioneered anonymous email communication by introducing the second- and third-generation anonymous remailer protocols, enabling users to send messages without revealing their identity or metadata. Mixmaster implemented fixed-size packets and layered onion encryption, thwarting traffic analysis and enhancing privacy. Mixminion advanced the design with improved reply blocks and more robust delivery, setting a technical precedent for metadata-resistant messaging and influencing later anonymity networks like Tor. These protocols embodied cypherpunk ideals by empowering individuals to communicate securely and anonymously, resisting surveillance and censorship. Wikipedia The Toolbox. Practical encryption tools that protect files, messages, and communications from surveillance. LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) - Provides the de facto standard for Linux full-disk encryption, enabling robust protection of sensitive data at rest. By introducing a secure metadata header supporting multiple key slots, LUKS allows for flexible key management and secure password changes without re-encryption. Managed via cryptsetup, it is integrated into nearly all major Linux distributions, empowering users to control their own cryptographic keys and resist unauthorized access. LUKS embodies cypherpunk values by democratizing strong encryption, making privacy and digital autonomy accessible to millions of users and organizations worldwide. Wikipedia dm-crypt - Enables robust, transparent block-level encryption within the Linux kernel, empowering users to secure entire disks or partitions against unauthorized access. As the foundational engine beneath LUKS, it supports advanced cipher modes like XTS-AES, ensuring strong cryptographic protection for sensitive data at rest. Widely adopted in privacy-centric distributions and by security professionals, it exemplifies cypherpunk principles by making strong, open source encryption accessible to all, directly countering surveillance and data theft. Its integration into mainstream operating systems has made full-disk encryption a practical default, advancing digital autonomy and resistance to coercive data disclosure. Wikipedia The Infrastructure. Without these systems, privacy tools couldn't exist. Open source operating systems that can be audited, verified, and trusted. The Building Blocks. Cryptographic libraries that developers use to build secure applications. Easy to use correctly, hard to misuse. LibreSSL - Provides a security-hardened, open source alternative to OpenSSL, created by the OpenBSD team in response to the catastrophic Heartbleed vulnerability. LibreSSL aggressively removes legacy code, modernizes cryptographic primitives, and enforces rigorous code auditing, reducing attack surface and improving reliability for privacy-critical applications. Its focus on transparency, minimalism, and open development directly advances cypherpunk goals of trustworthy, decentralized security infrastructure, powering secure communications in privacy tools, servers, and embedded systems. Wikipedia BoringSSL - Delivers a hardened, modern fork of OpenSSL designed to minimize attack surface and eliminate legacy vulnerabilities, powering secure communications in Chrome, Android, and Cloudflare. By removing outdated algorithms, tightening default security settings, and focusing on robust cryptographic primitives, it advances the cypherpunk goal of widespread, reliable encryption for billions of users. Its rigorous code review and proactive security stance set a new standard for open source cryptographic libraries, directly supporting privacy and digital freedom at global scale. Wikipedia Noise Protocol Framework - Enables the creation of secure, privacy-preserving communication protocols by defining modular cryptographic handshake patterns like Noise_NN and Noise_XX, which combine Diffie-Hellman key exchange and authenticated encryption (AEAD) for robust confidentiality and forward secrecy. Widely adopted in privacy-focused tools such as WireGuard and the Lightning Network, it empowers decentralized, censorship-resistant networks by making strong cryptography accessible and auditable, embodying cypherpunk principles of user autonomy and digital freedom. Wikipedia Modern Cypherpunk Privacy Layer. Selected for transparency, independence, and avoidance of telemetry or ad-tech ties. These VPNs represent privacy-first infrastructure. Money Without Middlemen. From theoretical concepts to working systems, these projects proved that value can be exchanged without institutions controlling the flow. DigiCash - Invented truly private digital payments by implementing blind signatures, enabling users to withdraw and spend e-cash tokens that banks could verify but not trace, thus separating identity from transaction history. DigiCash's architecture provided a practical demonstration of anonymous, cryptographically secure electronic cash, directly influencing the design of later cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and foundational privacy concepts in digital finance. Its legacy endures as a blueprint for privacy-preserving money and a milestone in the cypherpunk quest for digital freedom. Wikipedia b-money - Pioneered the concept of decentralized digital currency by outlining a system for electronic cash using a public, distributed ledger, proof-of-work mining, and cryptographically enforced contracts in b-money. Introduced mechanisms for digital scarcity, anonymous transactions, and consensus without trusted intermediaries, directly inspiring the design of Bitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies. Cited by Satoshi Nakamoto as foundational, it advanced cypherpunk ideals of privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship by envisioning money as a protocol, not an institution. Wikipedia bit gold - Established a decentralized digital currency concept by chaining proof-of-work puzzles with timestamped public registries, enabling trustless, verifiable ownership of digital assets without intermediaries. bit gold directly inspired the architecture of Bitcoin, introducing core ideas like distributed consensus, scarcity enforced by computation, and resistance to censorship. Its design anticipated blockchain's role in privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer value transfer, making it a foundational milestone in cypherpunk efforts to undermine centralized control over money and empower individual autonomy. Wikipedia Hashcash - Introduced the concept of proof-of-work to combat email spam by requiring senders to compute a SHA-based hash collision, thereby imposing a computational cost on bulk messaging and deterring abuse. Its elegant challenge - response mechanism became foundational for decentralized trustless systems, directly inspiring the mining process and consensus protocol of Bitcoin and influencing later privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. By demonstrating how cryptographic puzzles could enable resistance to censorship and Sybil attacks without central authorities, it advanced core cypherpunk ideals of autonomy, privacy, and digital freedom. Hashcash's legacy endures in modern anti-spam tools, blockchain security, and the architecture of decentralized digital cash. Wikipedia Breaking the Cloud Monopoly. Distributed systems that don't rely on centralized servers or corporate infrastructure. The Security Stack. The protocols and systems that make secure communication possible at Internet scale. DNSCrypt - Secures the typically unencrypted DNS lookup process by authenticating and encrypting queries between users and resolvers, thwarting interception, censorship, and surveillance by ISPs or adversaries. Utilizes modern cryptography, notably X25519 for key exchange, to ensure forward secrecy and integrity. By pioneering practical deployment of encrypted DNS before widespread adoption of DNS-over-HTTPS, it empowered individuals to reclaim privacy at a fundamental layer of internet communication, embodying cypherpunk principles of decentralization and resistance to surveillance. Wikipedia OTR (Off-the-Record Messaging) - Cryptographic protocol pioneering both perfect forward secrecy and deniability in real-time chat, it ensures that messages are encrypted and authenticated during transmission but cannot be proven to originate from a specific user after the conversation ends. By introducing these properties to instant messaging, it set a new standard for secure communications, directly influencing the design of modern protocols like Signal and inspiring broader adoption of ephemeral, privacy-preserving messaging. Its open source reference implementation and protocol specification have empowered activists, journalists, and privacy advocates worldwide to communicate securely, embodying cypherpunk ideals of decentralization and user autonomy. Wikipedia The Movement Infrastructure. Organizations and projects that defend digital rights, spread knowledge, and fight for freedom. The Origin Story. Before the term "cypherpunk" existed, these projects and manifestos laid the cultural and technical foundations. Every day, millions of people rely on these systems to communicate securely, transact privately, and resist surveillance. The next breakthrough is being built right now. Someone is writing the protocol that will obsolete everything on this list. Someone is deploying infrastructure that will protect the next generation. while (surveillance.exists()) { cypherpunks.code(); } Ship freedom. Lessons from the Fallen Not every privacy project stays true to its mission. Some were compromised. Some mysteriously shut down. Some made choices that betrayed their users' trust. This section documents projects that failed, were compromised, or can no longer be trusted. The graveyard of privacy tools teaches us as much as the Hall of Fame. "Don't trust. Verify." - Every cypherpunk who learned the hard way These services chose death over betrayal by choosing to shut down rather than backdoor their users. They deserve respect. These services were compromised, backdoored, blacklisted or taken over by law enforcement. They cannot be trusted. These services made architectural choices or policy decisions that fundamentally compromise user privacy. Privacy tools that were acquired by companies with different incentives. Every compromised project teaches us something: The only trusted system is one you can audit yourself, running on hardware you control or can remote attest and verify, using open protocols that can't be backdoored. Build systems that can't betray their users, even if the developers want to. Built with significant effort, in respect for those who put significantly more effort into the tools we use to stay free. Privacy is freedom. In crypto we trust. Cypherpunks Hall of Fame There was an error while loading. Please reload this page. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

In a new regulatory salvo, SpaceX is questioning whether rival AST SpaceMobile—a Texas-based satellite company—is too closely tied to Europe. Although it’s common for satellite players to criticize each other in regulatory filings, Elon Musk's company is now bringing geopolitics in the mix. In a 9-page filing, SpaceX urged the FCC to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile’s recent moves to establish a jointly owned European satellite service with British carrier Vodafone. The EU has been looking for alternatives to SpaceX's Starlink, and AST has described the project as ensuring "European sovereignty" in satellite communications. However, SpaceX is subtly suggesting that AST’s business isn’t entirely aligned with US interests. "AST’s application for a sovereign European system with an overseas 'command switch' raises fundamental interference, space sustainability, and national security concerns that require clarification and correction," SpaceX writes in its filing. AST says its satellite plans with Vodafone will include a “command switch to support European oversight and security,” providing European partners with a way to modify encryption keys for satellite communications and manage the satellite beams. In an earnings call last week, AST also indicated the satellite system for Europe will be part of the satellite constellation that serves all markets, including the US. "AST and its owners have made several claims recently that raise serious concerns about foreign control over its system," SpaceX argues. "In light of these claims, AST should clarify the extent of foreign ownership and control over its proposed system, including whether its application is more appropriately filed as a request for US market access." The FCC is currently reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite-to-phone service in the US through AT&T and Verizon. The application’s approval is crucial, especially since AST is hoping to kick off its service sometime next year. But the same system is also poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink service, which is already available through T-Mobile, and can power texting, mobile apps, and video calls in dead zones. In its filing, SpaceX also claims that AST’s procedures to retire aging satellites contain “many holes,” warranting a closer look from the FCC before green-lighting the application. “To highlight just one example, AST maintains a post-mission disposal plan to barrel-roll its satellites through other satellite constellations in order to compensate for AST’s lack of adequate fuel reserves but fails to explain how it will avoid collisions during these dangerous maneuvers,” SpaceX alleges. On Tuesday, T-Mobile submitted its own filing to the FCC, urging the commission to "take no action" on AST's application until the company provides more details about how it’ll address potential radio interference with ground-based cellular networks. AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But FCC Chair Brendan Carr has been a supporter of both SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. In April, he posted a video of his visit to AST’s Texas headquarters, and touted the company as a counter to China’s satellite ambitions. is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

IBIT now manages more than $73 billion in assets, more than three times the AUM of its closest rival, with the gains coming as institutional interest in Bitcoin has risen. Harvard University recently upped its position in IBIT to 6.8 million shares worth about $442 million, from a previous holding of 1.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. Other Bitcoin ETFs have also been hard-hit, with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shedding more than $266 million and $146 million in investments over the past five trading days, respectively, although none on Tuesday. The 11 spot Bitcoin funds collectively control more than $130 billion in assets. The Bitcoin funds declines have come even as fledgling Solana funds have added investments, particularly the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which has posted net inflows on every day of its less than three-week history and now oversees $611 million in AUM. On Wednesday, 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) became the fifth Solana-tracking fund to list on a U.S. exchange.

Title: Kyle Butler

Full Content:
Kyle Butler eats, sleeps, and breathes tattooing. The Aurora-born artist and entrepreneur has been collecting ink since he gave himself his first stick ’n’ poke at age 14 (it was the Deathwish Skateboards logo). A week after his 18th birthday, he moved to Chicago to study creative writing at Columbia College and soon began home tattooing. Two years later, he dropped out to devote himself to what had become a full-blown obsession. Now 33, he’s the sole owner of the Irving Park street shop Red Devil Tattoo, which he started with Miranda Larson in 2021, and also runs a private, appointment-only studio nearby. As tattooing moved from an underground industry to a “legitimate” trade in the late 20th century, home tattooing became frowned upon by the broader professional community. But many artists—including many industry trailblazers—had started as so-called “scratchers.” Over the past decade, home tattooing has experienced something of a renaissance thanks to the wide availability of single-use needles (an industry standard since the early 2000s) and home tattoo machines, along with the ubiquity of social media as a tool for learning and self-promotion. Butler embodies a shop owner who came from the modern underground. He remains excited about how reduced barriers to entry have led to fresh styles and ideas in tattooing. At the same time, he encourages a reverence for tattoo history and an investment in the craftsmanship (such as learning to build one’s own machines) that’s often lost to younger artists. To Butler, tattooing isn’t a trade, it’s a lifestyle—and he can’t imagine any other. I tattooed myself when I was 14. Then I got a tattoo in Indiana when I was 16 because you can get tattooed underage in Indiana, so we just drove over the [Illinois] border. Once I turned 18, I was getting tattooed all the time. I like getting tattooed. There’s something primal about it. No matter where you come from or who your ancestors are, at one point, they were tattooing themselves or marking their bodies or decorating [them]. Tattooing can be really transformative because it’s both immediate and permanent. You walk into a place one way and you walk out different. At 18, I had no inkling I was going to tattoo. I just knew I was obsessed. There’s all these ways you should go about [becoming a tattooer]: Get an apprenticeship, train, have a mentor, etc. I was way too antsy and maybe anti-authority for that. I just had to do it, so I started tattooing my friends. I dropped out of Columbia in 2015. I really liked school—like really, really—but tattooing kind of overtook all my time and energy. I lived at a big, shitty punk house with a million people; I paid, like, $200 a month in rent and split a room. That’s where a lot of my practice came: There’d be some punk band on tour who’d want to get tattoos after the show, so we’d stay up all night partying and tattooing. When I started, I wasn’t thinking of it as a hobby or a career. It felt more like a lifestyle. I just knew that I was gonna be into tattoos forever. If I was making money, if I wasn’t—there was no way I’d stop. I slowly started to get better and meet helpful people. I started to travel a lot, too. I was doing guest spots at different shops across the country. I did a couple really long trips where I packed all my tattoo stuff in my car and drove from, like, Chicago to LA, stopping and tattooing where I could—[working at] random shops where I had a friend from the Internet or a punk house where I knew people. Tattooing used to be really hard to get into. My generation no longer needs the traditional shop structure to make a career. There’s a lot of DIY, underground artists who don’t have to be legitimized in a traditional sense. Not having to go through other people to get your equipment and stuff, people are able to make a living themselves, which I think is cool. There’s bad parts about that, too. Tattooing has a really rich history and beautiful lineage. When you’re disavowing shops or the old ways in general, you’re narrowing your mind. I try to think of Red Devil as a contemporary model where it’s more people who maybe didn’t have the traditional shop apprenticeship, but we are a street shop. We do walk-ins. We’re interested in the people who’ve done it before us and carrying that [spirit] on. One of my biggest influences is [pioneering Filipino American tattooer] Leo Zulueta. I got tattooed by him right before I started tattooing. He’s sort of the godfather of modern tribalism. His style is super fast, punk rock, in-your-face-looking black work, which I’d seen out in the world, but to see it in person totally flipped my lid. The shop was set up different, like the lights were lower [than most studios] and the stuff on the walls was more anthropological photos, people from antiquity or with tattoos all over their faces—tribal tattoos from different cultures. He drew the tattoo right on [my skin] and took his time drawing, erasing, and drawing it again. It was very abstract and tailored to me. I hadn’t experienced any of that before. Sometimes I’d get tattooed at a shop and people would ice me or say something about how I was a “scratcher.” I didn’t really give a fuck. Maybe this is my stubbornness or contrariness or whatever, but if somebody told me not to do something, that made me want to do it more. It gave me a drive to get better. I still have a lot to prove. I don’t know if it’s to myself or other people, but this tattooing thing—it’s endlessly challenging. The realm of possibilities is so big I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface. Your creative and technical ability is always one step behind your vision of the future. I hadn’t put much forethought into starting a shop. I was working at my house for a few years, and then I got a job at [Rogers Park’s Fudo Tattoo], which I loved. I learned a lot from the owner, Dustin Golden. But then I started to feel antsy, and I quit and opened a private tattoo studio in this old warehouse. It was just me, and I really enjoyed it. Then I was bored of that, so I met Miranda and was like, “We should open a walk-in shop.” It was always the plan she’d eventually move back to Texas, and I’d take over. Then this past January, I opened a private studio a couple blocks from the shop. That’s a lot of places to work in ten years, but I think your environment can really dictate your creativity. Changing it is a really good way to open and close chapters of your life. When I started, I was sort of a snot-nosed punk rock kid, like, “Fuck you! I do whatever I want!” Now I have so much more respect for the people who did it before me, all of my favorite tattooers from the 70s, 80s, 90s. All the stuff they were able to accomplish pre-Internet, pre-tattoo television shows, when you had to make your own needles and pigments, and be a good craftsman—it’s unbelievable what they were able to do with the limited technology available to them. My old boss, Dustin, has been building machines since the 2000s. He was the first guy I was around who did that. I’d always struggled with machines. Being self-taught, I had to figure out all that stuff on my own. I was always trying to make them work better or fix them, only to break them and have to get something new. Dustin’s machines were the first ones I even liked. He taught me how he builds them. Having the technical knowledge to troubleshoot issues really changed my tattooing. That’s a lost art now because you can literally order anything you need to tattoo off Amazon and get it in a day. But there’s a real artfulness to getting a machine to look and sound and work exactly how you want. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle because I love people. I love talking to people and working in a city like Chicago, where everyone you tattoo is so different. Touch can be a really beautiful thing in how it connects people. Plus, people will sit in the shop all day and get tattooed next to somebody, and they’re all into it. Maybe none of them would ever have a conversation on the street, but now they’re sort of initiated into this physical, tangible blood ritual that’s quite bizarre. You walk in a grocery store or whatever, and somebody comments on your tattoo—that’s a bridge, too. I still love tattooing as much as when I started. I still get giddy [like] I did when I was 14, tattooing myself in my house. There’s something about it that is so potent to me. It hasn’t lost any of its magic.

Title: Michael Burry drops new AI bubble warning, and this time it comes with a Lord of the Rings meme

Michael Burry is warning of an AI bubble, pointing to a chart showing U.S. capex-to-GDP ratios hitting levels last seen before the dot-com and housing crashes. He says tech capex is rising at double-digit rates while AI stocks sit near record highs, a pattern where markets peak before spending does. His Lord of the Rings meme mocks investor complacency. Burry has reportedly taken large put positions against Nvidia and Palantir and even deregistered Scion, signaling he expects inflated AI valuations, excess capacity, and margin risks to trigger a correction.

Global shares stabilised somewhat on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s earnings report after the markets closed in the US, an update that analysts say could set the tone for the rest of 2025. Dublin Recovering some of Tuesday’s 2.3 per cent slide, the Iseq index closed up 1.5 per cent, outperforming other European indices. Bank stocks rallied and regained some momentum. AIB advanced by 1.7 per cent to close at €8.27 per share. Bank of Ireland finished the session at €14.97 per share, some 0.5 per cent higher, while PTSB added 0.3 per cent to close at €3.20. Home builders Cairn Homes and Glenveagh added 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent to finish off at €1.92 and €1.82 respectively as the latest property price index showed Irish house price inflation continuing to hover around the 8 per cent mark in September. Europe European shares were largely unchanged after hovering near a more than one-month low for a time on Wednesday. Both the blue-chip Stoxx 50 index and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by just 0.1 per cent, with the latter coming off its single biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. European tech stocks declined and then rebounded somewhat in advance of Nvidia’s all-important earnings report that could stoke or soothe investor worries about sky-high tech valuations. AI hardware maker Schneider Electric finished 0.3 per cent higher, while Siemens added 0.2 per cent and chipmaker ASML surged 2.4 per cent in choppy trading. Meanwhile, Kering lost 3.2 per cent after the luxury company’s boss Luca de Meo said a return to growth will require reducing its reliance on struggling flagship Gucci, according to a memo seen by Reuters. London The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index slid for a fifth consecutive session, losing 0.4 per cent, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was little changed at closing bell. UK inflation slowed down for the first time since May in October, offering relief to the Labour Party government before next week’s annual budget and boosting the chance of a rate cut by the Bank of England. Consumer-focused stocks like Unilever, up 0.4 per cent, put a floor under the declines. British American Tobacco, meanwhile, jumped by more than 1 per cent while JD Sports added 4.4 per cent and Primark owner Associated British Foods moved 0.8 per cent higher. Bank stocks dragged on the index, however, with Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds logging losses of between 0.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. New York Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday in advance of the Nvidia report, clawing back some ground lost during the earlier sell-off this week as investors repositioned their AI and tech bets. The Nasdaq Composite moved 0.6 per cent higher, the S&P 500 advanced by 0.3 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Chipmaker Nvidia climbed 2 per cent, leaving shares of the most important stock on Wall Street down almost 9 per cent this month. The AI darling has come to represent the nascent artificial intelligence technology that has powered much of the stock market’s rally in recent months. Its quarterly results and forward guidance will be scrutinised to determine how much life remains in the AI boom and whether worries over inflated valuations and a potential AI bubble are warranted. A basket tracking the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple and Meta, advanced 0.9 per cent. Alphabet surged as much as 7 per cent, its biggest gain since September, amid a wave of glowing reviews of the new version of its Gemini AI model. Target slipped 0.1 per cent after the retail giant trimmed its profit forecast for the year. Home improvement company Lowe’s jumped nearly 5 per cent after reporting profit that topped expectations on a pickup in online sales and growth in demand from professional contractors. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why Robinhood's CIO Has Been Looking to 'Protect Some Capital' Lately

Some "smart money" has been seeing signs of rain—and reaching for the umbrella. Robinhood (HOOD), the company behind the popular retail trading app, last week added to its allocation to T-bills, the short-term Treasury notes considered some of the safest investments around, "to protect some capital," CIO Stephanie Guild said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. "I felt like the market was giving you signs that it was going to sell off a bit," Guild said. As the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX, spiked and broad market benchmarks reflected investor jitters, some pros were making moves to shore up their portfolios. Meanwhile, retail investors have started to tiptoe back into some of this year's high-flyers after they took a dip. Institutional investors are sometimes referred to as "smart money"—and the general public "dumb money"—because the former tends to be a step ahead on market pivots. Robinhood's robo-advisor has lately turned more defensive, potentially a caution signal worth heeding. Robinhood Strategies, the March-launched robo-advisor with over $1 billion in assets, added to its healthcare investments in October, according to Guild, and slimmed its holdings in technology. She said investors were right to start questioning the valuations of stocks ginned up on the AI-rally, and that while she believes in the possible benefits of the technology, one has to reckon with the short-term question of how much it'll cost to develop. The company's managed portfolios are also invested in rare earth stocks and industrial defense companies. a nod to the Trump administration's policies. "The Fed matters less than it used to," she said. "I think the President and [the administration's] actions matter a little bit more." The Robinhood CIO also characterized the recent dip as "kinda normal," and observed that retail investors were wading back into the names that had rallied hard and more recently were "hurt the most"—stocks like CoreWeave (CRWV), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META).

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday Wednesday ahead of highly anticipated earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) due after the closing bell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while the Dow fell. Shares of the AI chipmaker climbed ahead of what is being widely viewed as the biggest event of this earnings season. Lowe's (LOW) stock surged after the home improvement retailer reported a better quarterly profit than analysts had expected. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares continued their winning streak that began Monday when Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed a stake in the owner of Google and YouTube. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) climbed after the power company received approval for an up to $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. Eversource Energy (ES) shares tumbled after a Connecticut regulator blocked the utility’s plan to sell its Aquarion Water subsidiary to a newly created quasi-public entity for $2.4 billion. Shares of Plug Power (PLUG) sank after the maker of hydrogen fuel cells said it would sell $375 million in notes that investors could convert into the firm’s stock. Shares of Valero Energy (VLO), APA (APA), and others in the energy sector declined along with the price of crude, which slid amid concerns about oversupply. Gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded in the red.

Title: DRAMA: STREET HOLDS BREATH FOR NVIDIA EARNINGS... DEVELOPING...

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’s recent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The stock market rally — ﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years. Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue. Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled a sell-off in AI stocks over the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year. “The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN. Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks. “Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.” Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price. As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising about circular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals. Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive. “Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert, CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.” And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy. At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany. Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout. Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave. “That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

Title: BlackRock bleeds $523M in record outflow as Bitcoin crashes below $90K

BlackRock’s IBIT suffered its largest single-day outflow in history on 18 November, as institutional clients exited Bitcoin positions. The redemptions forced BlackRock to sell the underlying BTC BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic $523 million outflow on 18 November 18. Institutional clients dumped Bitcoin exposure through IBIT as BTC failed to reclaim $100K, triggering the largest net negative flow in the fund’s history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just suffered its worst day ever. IBIT hemorrhaged $523 million on 18 November, shattering all previous outflow records as institutional investors abandoned Bitcoin positions below $90,000. Arkham Intelligence data reveals the magnitude of the exodus. BlackRock buys or sells Bitcoin to settle outstanding IBIT shares on a T+1 basis. This means today’s $523M BTC sale reflects actual client trading activity from yesterday. The outflow represents the largest net negative flow in IBIT’s entire existence. No other day comes close. IBIT’s selling pressure overwhelmed the broader spot Bitcoin ETF landscape, according to Soso Value data. Total market outflows hit -$372.77M on 18 November, with BlackRock’s fund accounting for 140% of total negative flows. Source: SoSoValue Other major ETFs showed minimal activity. Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, Ark’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL all recorded zero or near-zero flows. Only Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund posted meaningful inflows at $139.63M, but this couldn’t offset IBIT’s historic dump. The data showed that institutional money fled Bitcoin through the industry’s largest and most liquid ETF. Bitcoin crashed 3.15% to $89,989.82 as the institutional selling wave hit. The breakdown confirmed technical weakness that’s been building since BTC failed to hold $100K in mid-November. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator is currently at -3,755.91, indicating deeply bearish momentum. Bitcoin has shed nearly $10,000 from recent highs near $100K, erasing weeks of gains in a matter of days. IBIT still holds $72.76 billion in total net assets, representing 3.93% of Bitcoin’s market cap. The fund has maintained cumulative net inflows of $58.22 billion since its launch. However, yesterday’s record outflow signals a potential shift in institutional sentiment. The timing suggests institutional clients lost confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim six figures. After multiple rejections at $100K, large allocators pulled the trigger on redemptions. BlackRock must sell the underlying Bitcoin when clients redeem IBIT shares. The $523M figure represents actual BTC that hit the market, not just paper selling. This real supply pressure accelerated Bitcoin’s descent below key support levels. Is this a temporary pause in the institutional Bitcoin adoption story, or the start of a deeper correction?

Title: Nvidia’s Earnings Report Arrives Tonight and Its Stock Is Rising Ahead of the News

Nvidia shares are showing signs of life on a critical day for financial markets. The stock was up 2% recently ahead of the release of Nvidia's (NVDA) quarterly results after the closing bell, the most highly anticipated event of the earnings reporting season. Coming into today's session, the stock had lost nearly 15% of its value since hitting a record high in late October. But it's still up nearly 40% for the year, roughly three times the gain of the S&P 500 and trailing only Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) in the Magnificent 7. Hyperbolizing about the importance of Nvidia's quarterly results has become a bit of investor vogue lately. Will they determine the future of the company—currently the world's most-valuable—all humanity, or just the AI trade? Whatever the case, the numbers will be closely watched and the insta-analysis plentiful. There aren't many stocks out there that capture broader attention in the way Nvidia does. That's not just because it's been a powerful gainer, but also because of its substantial weight in the benchmark S&P 500, which means its moves affect the legions whose holdings lean toward low-cost passive investments. Stocks, and particularly tech stocks, have been under pressure lately, as investors have begun to look for cracks in the argument for ever-higher investment in AI technology and offered up some skepticism about the arguably circular nature of investment in the industry. "I think people are really gonna need (CEO Jensen Huang) to explain this circular deal mentality, because I don't think it's stopping anytime soon," said Ben Reitzes, Head of Tech Research at Melius Research, in an interview on CNBC Wednesday morning. Reitzes said investors will want to hear more from Huang on his methodology, the kinds of return on investment Nvidia expects and what he sees in AI usage that gives him confidence investments are good ones. Futures markets indicate that Nvidia's shares could move dramatically in the days after its report, which—in the near term, at least—could determine the path ahead for stocks. LPL Financial on Wednesday said traders anticipate a move of near 7% in either direction, which would represent its biggest reaction since the fourth quarter of last year. Some investors have already moved away from the high-powered stock in various forms, making notable portfolio changes before Nvidia's numbers landed. Softbank recently sold its Nvidia stake, though it said the move was intended to fund investments in OpenAI; Peter Thiel's hedge fund also sold. Today, stock investors are seeing some green in their screens after several days of red. The S&P 500, which has lost ground the past four sessions, was up slightly recently. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 also ticked higher, while the SOX index of semiconductor stocks gained more than 1%. (Here's our live coverage of today's trading.) The winter is generally seen as an upbeat season for markets, but a disappointing report or outlook from Nvidia could mean this year is different.

Nvidia’s quarterly results are almost here, and anxiety is running high. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's Fear Index, on Tuesday ended the day just below 25, near its highest level since May, when the market was cooling off from April’s tariff tantrum. The index has risen substantially in the past week after coasting along in the mid-teens throughout the second half of the year. (It was recently a bit below 24; a reading below 20 is generally considered calm.) And CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks seven stock-market metrics to gauge the mood on Wall Street, yesterday fell to its lowest level since mid-April. Six of the seven index inputs were flashing “Extreme Fear” on Wednesday morning, with measures of momentum and market breadth having slumped in recent weeks. Wall Street's mood can have as much of an impact on short-term stock performance as the health of the economy or developments with a specific business. Today investors are largely concerned with the quarterly earnings from Nvidia, due after the bell, which could substantially inform how people feel about stocks going forward. Recent anxiety has centered on AI, with some investors worrying that tech giants are overspending on technology with uncertain commercial prospects. Others argue AI will transform nearly every industry, justifying tech’s massive investments and high stock valuations. The AI bubble debate has been playing out for some time, but it intensified this month. Forty-five percent of fund managers surveyed by Bank of America in November said an AI bubble was the biggest tail risk facing the market, up from 33% last month and just over 10% in September. More than half of those surveyed said AI was already in a bubble. And bullish sentiment among retail investors last week fell to its lowest level since early September, according to the Association of American Individual Investors. Bearish sentiment jumped nearly 13 percentage points, the biggest week-over-week increase since February. The stock market faces a critical test this afternoon when Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings. The AI chip giant's quarterly report has become a must-watch event on Wall Street this year, with its results often treated as a proxy for AI demand and a major driver of the AI rally. AI bubble concerns and some high-profile divestments have dragged down Nvidia's stock this month, but expectations are still high. Analysts predict the huge amounts of capital tech companies are pouring into data centers will underpin another strong quarter for the chipmaker.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2025 8:04:54 AM PST by Red Badger The endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report. According to a new SEC filing, the Harvard University endowment’s largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report. At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoin’s price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Google’s parent company). Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowment’s holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters, the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowment’s holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, it’s definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments. According to Forbes, Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities. Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others.

Title: CMBS Expert Mike Strug Leaves BlackRock to Join Stephen Muller’s Vanadium Group
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/11/cmbs-expert-mike-strug-join-vanadium-group/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:56:06Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy One of the great connectors in commercial real estate has jumped from BlackRock to a lesser-known advisory shop that specializes in equity deals and major mixed-use projects. Mike Strug, founder of the Young Real Estate Professionals of New York (YREPNY), an informal networking group that has connected thousands of industry players since 2001, has left BlackRock after 14 years as a vice president of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) analytics to join Vanadium Group. Vanadium Group is a six-person advisory firm founded in 2019 by Stephen Muller, formerly chief investment officer at Arris Properties Group and managing director at Greenwich Group International. The firm specializes primarily in equity — and some debt — brokerage, where it connects middle-market capital markets owner-operators and developers to the debt and equity needed to finish CRE projects or finance new ones. Strug, who began his 28-year CRE career in lending, told CO that as much as he loved working at BlackRock’s analytics arm, he wanted to get back into the nitty-gritty of deal flow. “I wanted to get back on the deal side,” he said. “We’re nimble, there’s only six of us here, I’ve known Steve Muller for 23 years … so it was the perfect fit for me to come over.” Before joining BlackRock, Strug spent several years as a loan officer at IDB Bank, as an investment officer at Assurant, and as a senior originations associate at TIAA-CREF. Strug also said that the move over the Vanadium aids the position he holds as founder of YREPNY, which has met once a month in New York City for the past 24 years. That volunteer job has turned Strug into an in-demand guest speaker at colleges and “a pseudo-mentor for thousands of young professionals,” as he humbly describes himself. “It’s helped me expand my network over the years and give back,” he said. “And here, now, I’m able to leverage my network and help drive business for Vanadium Group.” Muller began his career 25 years ago underwriting deals at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and has directed and overseen real estate investments worth exceeding $20 billion across different asset classes in multiple C-suite capacities. He told CO he was thrilled to find someone like Strug who can aid Vanadium’s underwriting through his decades of private equity CMBS analysis and his deep list of contacts forged from his monthly mentorship meetings. “We do a huge amount of the work, and to be able to find someone who has the kind of network like Mike’s, but who also has the intellectual horsepower, is not easy at all,” said Muller. “What I said to Mike was, ‘It’s not just your Rolodex that I view as an opportunity, but you were doing CMBS surveillance and writing private equity quality research materials.’ That’s not teachable.” Muller is the first to admit that many in the industry might not have heard of Vanadium, which specializes in making markets for preferred equity pieces of limited partner equity, as well as advising large-scale mixed-use projects. Muller listed The Wharf is Washington, D.C. and Miami Worldcenter as among the biggest mixed-use projects he’s advised and underwritten. But it’s the equity space, rather than the burgeoning world of private credit, that Muller and Strug believe offers them the greatest opportunity to bring investors together, either directly or through syndication. “Probably 80 percent of our business is equity, as opposed to debt, and that in and of itself is very unique — most of the advisory firms are the other way around,” explained Muller. “There are very few true equity shops left in the industry.” Moreover, Muller emphasized that Strug will help his firm build and grow its relationships with institutional equity groups like small to medium-size life insurance companies, pension funds and endowments, which often don’t have the ability to either syndicate equity originations in-house or create liquidity for their existing investments through the secondary market. “There are very few people like Mike who can truly speak the institutional language, have an incredible institutional Rolodex, but can also bring the entrepreneurial spirit that he brings,” said Muller. “He’s a natural-born entrepreneur and networker.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Nvidia shares set for $300bn swing around high-stakes earnings

Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:54:53Z
Full Content:
Nvidia investors are bracing for a roughly $300 billion (€260 billion) swing in market value following quarterly results on Wednesday, amid rising unease over Silicon Valley’s vast spending on artificial intelligence. Options markets imply traders are expecting the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker’s share price to move by an average of 6.4 per cent in either direction when markets open on Thursday, equivalent to a gain or loss of about $280 billion in value. Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company at the end of October but since then has been caught up in a sharp stock market sell-off led by big AI players that has dragged the chipmaker’s shares down 11 per cent. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist, said: “The angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable.” The California-based company’s critical role in the AI boom means its results have in recent years heavily influenced the direction and mood of the broader tech-dominated US stock market. Wednesday’s results arrive as investors’ enthusiasm for the AI boom appears to be on the wane, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down more than 4 per cent over the past five sessions. [ Concerns mounting that we are well into market-bubble territoryOpens in new window ] Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have been among those hardest hit by the recent bout of selling, with Meta down 19 per cent and Oracle down 20 per cent over the past month. Mike Zigmont, co-head of trading at Visdom Investment Group, said: “In the run-up to Nvidia’s earnings announcement, we’re experiencing cold feet and worry that prices went too high to justify.” “If Nvidia delivers disappointing guidance Wednesday, the [market] is going to sink significantly,” he added. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue of about $55.5 billion on Wednesday, according to Visible Alpha data, above the company’s prior guidance in August of roughly $54 billion. The company is also expected to forecast its revenue for the current quarter, which analysts estimate will be about $62 billion, up roughly 58 per cent year-on-year. Nvidia has consistently beaten predictions over recent quarters, ratcheting up expectations that it will outperform again. Chief executive Jensen Huang in October announced the company had secured $500 billion in revenue for the next five quarters, at the high end of Wall Street estimates, helping the company temporarily surpass a record $5 trillion market valuation. Nvidia has been buffeted by volatile trade relations between China and the US this year. A rally in its shares last month was boosted by hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough. But the future of its AI chip sales in China remains uncertain, caught between US export controls and a push from Beijing to build more chips at home. Nvidia has in recent months signed multibillion-dollar deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, outside investors and rival tech groups to build data centres that use its chips to run AI models. Analysts have drawn attention to the circularity of some of these agreements, which often involve suppliers, investors and customers of the same handful of companies. Big Tech groups have also recently made greater use of public and private debt markets to fund their spending on AI infrastructure, which they had previously largely paid for with cash. Nvidia and Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic, whose chatbot Claude is a major competitor to OpenAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia earnings updates: Investors brace for Q3 results, with the stock down 10% in November

Nvidia's earnings are in — and Wall Street breathed a collective sigh of relief at better-than-expected revenue and guidance. The stock jumped 3% after hours following the results and ticked higher still during the company's call with analysts. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." The AI chip maker reported revenue of $57 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $55 billion. In its all-important data center unit, revenue was $51 billion versus estimates of $49.31 billion. Earnings-per-share clocked in at $1.30 compared to estimates of $1.26. The firm also topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, projecting $65.0 billion in revenue compared to estimates of $61.98 billion. CFO Colette Kress reaffirmed that Nvidia is "on track" for "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the 2025-2026 period, adding that the number could grow as new deals are struck. Discussing the China market, the executive said Nvidia is "disappointed" in the current AI chip export restrictions, which resulted in sizable purchase orders to China not being fulfilled "due to geopolitical issues." The company did not factor in any data center compute revenue from China in its Q4 projection. Nvidia is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments, Kress added. Huang said Blackwell sales are "off the charts" and Nvidia plans to "grow our presence in the US over the next four years." The CEO also talked up recent deals with Anthropic and ongoing partnerships with xAI, OpenAI, and other tech companies, including what he described as "misunderstood" hyperscalers — a category of AI companies including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — which account for a large chunk of Nvidia's chip business. Scroll on for the full play-by-play from Nvidia's earnings call: Nvidia's stock is trading up around 4.5% after hours as the analyst call ends. Huang says Nvidia is "excellent at every phase of AI," but that inference is "really, really hard." "People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it's easy. Anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard," Huang says. The call is wrapping up after about an hour of prepared remarks and the Q&A. "Where are we working right now, in terms of next year, next year there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through, and our systems are by no means very easy to work with," CFO Kress says. "There are a tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So we're taking all of that into account." "But we do believe, if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle time, and mix, that we will work to try and hold at our gross margins in the mid 70s," she adds. The CEO says factors like financing and power aren't "easy," but "they're all solvable." Huang says the chipmaker is "quite confident" in its supply chain. He says the most important thing Nvidia can do is do "a good job planning." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood." Huang says it isn't just hyperscalers like Microsoft and Amazon buying its GPUs, but other companies across various sectors will also adopt them, given the efficiencies they can provide. He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." Huang says AI hyperscalers can be "misunderstood."

He says that investing in Nvidia's GPUs "only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing." "Moore's Law scaling has really slowed," he adds. "Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down." Huang says that Nvidia's customer base can rely on it because of the "depth and breadth" of its supply chain. "The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says.

"The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured really, you know, really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them," Huang says. Huang says when the chipmaker makes forecasts and plans with customers, it's taken seriously because of Nvidia's balance sheet. Huang says that the company will continue to do stock buybacks with respect to investments. He says all of the investments Nvidia has made are associated with expanding the CUDA ecosystem. It appears the rising Nvidia tide is lifting all AI ships. Following Nvidia's earnings report, shares of other AI chipmakers also climbed. Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are up over 7% after hours, AMD shares are up over 6%, and Oracle is up over 5%. "With tensions growing across the Street over the last few weeks as AI bubble fears have grown and put pressure on tech stocks .... tonight the markets and tech stocks got a pop-the-champagne moment with Nvidia's robust earnings and guidance," Ives wrote. "Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view...this is another validation point for the AI Revolution and, our view, we are in the top of the third inning of this AI game." "Nvidia's supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world," the CEO says. "TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us, and we were planning for a big year," he adds. The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." The first question for Nvidia's execs is about the company's $500 billion in AI chip orders for the combined 2025-2026 period. CFO Kress says things are "on track" and "the number will grow." "We'll probably be taking more orders," she adds. For example, "Anthropic is also net new," she says, referencing its recent deal, "so there's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced." "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," the Nvidia CEO says. "From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months.

We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." The AI bubble debate has heated up in recent months. Overall, Huang unsurprisingly remains a bullish AI optimist. He recently dismissed concerns about AI job displacement by saying that someone was more likely to lose their job to another person using AI than to AI itself. "We are not assuming any data center compute revenue from China in Q4," Kress says, talking about Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter. Kress says the chipmaker remains "focused on building resiliency and redundancy" in its global supply chain. Last month, Nvidia celebrated its first Blackwell wafer produced in the US, she says. "We will continue to work with Foxconn, Wistron, Amcor, spill and others to grow our presence in the US over the next four years," Kress says. OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, xAI, and others are getting a shoutout. It's been a busy year for Nvidia, which has announced deals, investments, and partnerships with a slew of AI startups and more established companies. Kress says sizable purchase orders to China didn't happen this quarter "due to geopolitical issues" and the competitive market there. She says the company was disappointed it couldn't ship more competitive products to China, but is committed to "continued engagement" with both the US and Chinese governments. Shares initially popped 3% immediately following the earnings release, but have risen higher after hours as Nvidia's analyst call progresses. Nvidia says in its 10-Q filing, released Wednesday, that energy capacity could be a potential hurdle for AI adoption. Building energy infrastructure "is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges," the company says. In addition to access to capital for certain companies, the company says energy bottlenecks could ultimately "delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption." She says Blackwell's GB 300 surpassed GB 200 and accounted for roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. "The transition to GB300 has been seamless," Kress says. CFO Colette Kress said that Nvidia sees hyperscalers like Meta as a major contributor to its future growth. "We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says.

"We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads, contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity," Kress says. Kress adds that Nvidia is helping Meta increase the quality of its services, upping the amount of time people spend on Threads and Facebook. Kress kicks off the call by reiterating Huang's "half a trillion" in AI chip orders number that he previously disclosed. "We currently have visibility to a half a trillion dollars in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026," CFO Colette Kress says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress have kicked off the chipmaker's third-quarter earnings call. The executives will begin with prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts. Huang made headlines at Nvidia's October GTC conference when he said that the company already has $500 billion in chip orders for the combined 2025 and 2026 period, including orders for its Rubin chip. After Nvidia's better-than-expected Q4 revenue guidance, analysts and investors will likely ask for more details about that projection and whether the number has grown. Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, says Nvidia's report indicates that the AI revolution "is nowhere near its peak," both from a market demand and production supply chain perspective. Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies.

Despite investor concerns about mounting capital expenditures forcing companies to slow their AI adoption cycles, Monteiro said Nvidia continues to prove that data-center scaling is a priority for tech companies. Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that "Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter." However, he said concerns remain about whether Nvidia can meet demand for its AI deployments. "Investors are increasingly focused on whether hyperscalers can actually put this capacity to use fast enough. The question is whether physical bottlenecks in power, land, and grid access will cap how quickly this demand translates into revenue growth through 2026 and beyond," Bourne said. "Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out," Jensen Huang says in Nvidia's earnings release. "Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once." Nvidia said it expects to bring in $65.0 billion in the current quarter, which is above analysts' consensus estimate of $61.98 billion. That was a closely watched number, and the better-than-expected result is likely helping propel Nvidia's shares after hours. Third quarter results Is the AI frenzy heating up or cooling down? No company is a stronger measure of that than Nvidia. High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return.

High-profile investors, such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel's hedge fund, have sold off their Nvidia stock in recent months, adding to concerns that the company's valuation has been inflated by circular deals and commitments that may never yield a return. How much will Nvidia have to overperform to shake those fears off? For the first time, Nvidia established a "deep technology partnership" with Anthropic, committing to invest up to $10 billion in the AI startup. It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia."

It was part of a Tuesday announcement from Anthropic that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, "powered by Nvidia." As part of its expanded partnership with Microsoft, the tech giant will also invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic. "We're excited to bring our models as a choice to Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic will be the first model that is available on, you know, all three of the biggest clouds," Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a video announcing the deal. After Huang hyped up the Rubin architecture in Nvidia's last earnings call, the chipmaker unveiled its new Rubin CPX in September. Nvidia said it's a class of GPUs "designed for massive-context inference." Analysts and investors will likely want an update on demand for Rubin CPX, which is expected at the end of 2026. Nvidia announced a partnership with OpenAI in September and shared plans to invest up to $100 billion in building out its data centers. OpenAI plans to construct "at least 10 gigawatts" of AI data centers using Nvidia systems. The companies have said that the first phase of the partnership is "targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform." Analysts may want an update on the plan's progress. GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: GPU depreciation is a part of the AI bubble debate that has been brought to the fore by prominent investors recently, including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos. But Business Insider's Ali Barr argues that their arguments are flawed. The author of the Tech Memo newsletter writes: "Investors have begun to worry that GPUs only have useful lives of one or two years, while cloud providers depreciate the value of these assets over five or six years. An accounting mismatch like this could set the AI industry up for a nasty earnings hit in a few years. This view has become almost a consensus on Wall Street now. It's one of the main pieces of evidence for the argument that we're in a huge AI bubble. The problem is that it's wrong: Even as Nvidia rolls out new GPU architectures every 18 months or less, GPUs aren't aging out nearly as fast as some investors fear." Read his full argument here. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. As Joe puts it: "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. If you're an AI bull that believes in the productivity gains that will be unlocked, you might be OK with waiting a long time for that to materialize. Or maybe it's the opposite. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? That can be risky. As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. Suddenly, the companies pouring tens of billions into AI — and getting the benefit of the doubt for their efforts — are feeling the heat. The group, which felt unassailable mere weeks ago, is now facing questions from investors: When is this going to start paying off? And do I want to wait around that long?" CFRA Research also expects Nvidia to beat estimates and point to further progress in 2026. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist. "We would point towards recent guidance given by management during NVIDIA GTC D.C. that has Blackwell/Rubin generations amounting to $500B of revenue off of 20M GPUs sold with 30% of that already being shipped," Luria stated. Davidson has a $250 price target for Nvidia, valuing the stock at 42 times estimated 2026 earnings and implying a jump of about 39%. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicts that Nvidia's revenue will come in slightly above Wall Street estimates at $56 billion. His team predicts Nvidia's calendar EPS will reach $7.75 per share in 2026 and could go as high as $9.50 per share in 2027.

While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid. Additionally, his team is optimistic that Nvidia's product pipeline, the Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, and Vera Rubin chips, will help drive growth in 2026.

Title: $372M outflows hit Bitcoin ETFs – What’s driving the panic?

Time Published: 2025-11-19T14:00:17Z

What’s driving this unexpected reshuffling across crypto funds? Bitcoin ETFs saw $372.8 million in net outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT with $523.2 million in withdrawals. No, Grayscale and Franklin Templeton recorded inflows, while others remained flat. Global crypto investment products are facing a sharp pullback as rising macroeconomic uncertainty shakes investor confidence. Exchange-traded products saw a massive wave of outflows, with withdrawals crossing $2 billion worldwide. According to data from Farside Investors, spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have been hit the hardest, recording continuous outflows since the 12th of November, signaling a shift in market sentiment just as volatility begins to climb. On the 18th of November, Bitcoin ETFs extended their losing streak, posting $372.8 million in net outflows. BlackRock’s IBIT led the downturn with $523.2 million in withdrawals, making it the only product with negative flows on that day. In contrast, other major issuers recorded modest inflows. Grayscale’s BTC added $139.6 million, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC saw $10.8 million. The remaining issuers recorded flat, zero flows, according to Farside Investors. These market moves came as Bitcoin slipped below the $90,000 mark, reflecting broader risk aversion. However, the asset showed early signs of recovery at press time, trading at $91,796.18, up 0.82% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. Yet, despite the slight bounce, sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin’s RSI stayed below the neutral line and continued trending downward, suggesting bearish momentum. Meanwhile, price volatility spiked, signaling unstable price action and highlighting that bulls may struggle to regain control in the short term. Source: Santiment A recent report by 21Shares noted that Bitcoin’s drop below $100K, now 27% off its peak, signals a short-term correction rather than a full-blown bear market. The decline has been driven by several factors: institutional unwinding of basis trades, falling yields, long-term holders offloading around 42,000 BTC, and continued ETF outflows. Broader macroeconomic pressures, including delayed interest rate cuts and weakness in tech markets, have added to the strain. Despite this pullback, the report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong. Selling pressure is easing, liquidity is improving post-shutdown, and long-term demand is growing, fueled by institutional interest and anticipated regulatory clarity. Key technical levels to watch are resistance at $98K–$100K and support at $85K. If Bitcoin can hold the $85K–$90K range and reclaim $98K–$102K, a move toward $110K+ is likely. However, a break below $85K could lead to extended consolidation in the $75K–$80K zone. Overall, the current move appears to be a healthy reset, not a trend reversal. If looked carefully, the largest chunk of ETF outflows, particularly from BlackRock, appears to be tied to institutional trading strategies rather than retail panic selling. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes noted that hedge funds, including firms like Goldman Sachs, were driving the withdrawals. These funds previously used Bitcoin ETFs to execute basis trades, a strategy where traders buy spot ETF positions while shorting Bitcoin Futures on CME to profit from the spread. When yields were high, the trade was lucrative, offering returns of around 14% in October. As spreads narrowed to below 5%, the trade lost its appeal, leading hedge funds to unwind their positions. According to Hayes, this wave of liquidations sparked institutional outflows, which in turn unsettled retail investors, intensifying the overall wave of withdrawals. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt of the recent market pullback, the trend wasn’t uniform across all assets. At press time, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs saw outflows of $74.2 million, reflecting broader caution toward major crypto assets. Investor sentiment toward alternative assets remained more positive, with Spot Solana [SOL] ETFs drawing $26.2 million in inflows during the same period. These mixed flows indicate that investors aren’t exiting digital assets altogether; they’re reallocating capital, reassessing risk, and exploring opportunities beyond dominant market leaders amid rising volatility.

THE GOVERNMENT’S NEW housing plan was today defended by the Taoiseach who claimed that the government is making progress on housing. Micheál Martin said the cost and affordability “continues to be an issue with a growing population”. His comments come after the release of the latest report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) finds that house prices jumped by 7.6% in the year to September. This is up from the 7.5% rise recorded in the year to August. Dublin saw prices rise by 5.3%, but they were up by 9.4% outside the capital in the year to September. The highest median price for a dwelling in the 12 months to September 2025 was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Donegal. Advertisement The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to September 2025 was Blackrock in Dublin, with a median price of €808,000, while Castlerea, Roscommon had the least expensive price of €148,000. Speaking during Leaders’ Questions, Labour leader Ivana Bacik described the new housing plan as “old milk in new bottles”. “Nothing new on affordable home ownership, no clarity on what new powers the Land Development Agency will have, and no ambition on social housing,” she added. She accused the government of abandoning annual targets for new home building. Martin hit back saying Bacik “told an untruth” when she said “the government had no social housing targets”. The government plans to deliver 12,000 new social homes “every year over the lifetime of the plan”, he said. Martin said needs the government needs to deliver upward of 50,000 houses a year, stating that €20 billion needs to be spent every year. “The state will not be able to do €20 billion every year. The private sector has to be involved,” he said, accusing Labour of consistently being hostile to any private sector dimension to housing. Related Reads Why Ireland's most toothless housing crisis measure is finally getting an overhaul Gaeltacht agency welcomes housing plan - but uncertainty remains over planning guidelines Here's what experts think of the government's housing plan Bacik also criticised a plan to reduce minimum apartment standards, which she said the government: “backed down in the courts on Monday”. In the High Court this week, the government’s legal representation said it would now carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to see whether the reduced apartment sizes are in line with existing regulations. They maintain the standard designs launched during the summer will not be modified. The Taoiseach responded, saying the new design standards had been put forward because the government wanted to “narrow the viability gap when it came to building apartments”. The Social Democrats Holly Cairns asked the Taoiseach why annual house building targets were not included in the government’s plans and why the overall target “goes beyond the lifetime of this government”. Martin claimed that under the previous plan, Housing for All, the Government “exceeded” its targets, describing it as an “inconvenient truth for the opposition”.

Title: Inside the California 'AI factory' that showcases the contradiction at the heart of the tech race
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo
Time Published: 2025-11-19T13:52:41Z
Full Content:
Google's ultra-private CEO Sundar Pichai is showing me around Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun. But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. "AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on," he insists. "It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions." But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a "sudden correction" in global financial markets, saying "market valuations appear stretched" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that "there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now". Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: "I think no company is going to be immune, including us." So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these "inflection points": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. "Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence." But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is "palpably exciting" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: "It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… "So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this." Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: "restricted". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term "AI factories" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: "I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: "If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough." He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. "I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies," he said. But he also said: "What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure." Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. "I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true," he told me. "Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it." But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: "truth matters". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? "I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. "You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy," he adds. "I think that will have consequences." Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.

Strong sales at artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia did little to quell investor worries. The accountancy giant says artificial intelligence will eventually lead to fewer entry-level positions at the firm. Thousands of earthquakes were caused by magma "pumping through" Earth's crust for three months, they say. One of the pioneers in the current AI boom, he has had disagreements with fellow engineers over the future of the technology. The chip maker says revenue for the three months to October jumped 62% to $57bn. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

November 19, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates.com MarketNewsUpdates News Commentary NEW YORK, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into solar design platforms is accelerating as companies work to automate and enhance the solar project lifecycle. With AI, design platforms can instantly analyze satellite imagery, shading, roof geometry, and energy consumption patterns to create highly customized system proposals. This integration reduces the time needed for manual surveys and engineering work, making project initiation much faster. It improves accuracy, helping installers minimize errors in system sizing, equipment selection, and installation planning. Companies adopting AI-driven design tools are positioning themselves to handle higher project volumes with fewer resources. A report from Grand View Research said that the global solar AI market size was estimated at USD 5.96 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 18.43 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 20.8% from 2025 to 2030. The report had key Market Trends & Insights: “North America solar AI market dominated the global industry and accounted for a 36.8% share in 2024; Based on technology, the machine learning segment dominated the industry and held a 49.9% share in 2024; Based on application, the Smart Grid Management segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; Based on end use, the industrial segment held the largest revenue share in 2024; North America: Largest market in 2024; Asia Pacific: Fastest growing market.” A.I. Companies active in the markets this week include: PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). The Grand View Research report continued: “AI models are significantly transforming the solar energy industry by improving forecasting accuracy, which is crucial for optimizing energy production and consumption. By integrating real-time weather data with historical energy trends, these models provide more precise predictions about solar energy generation. This enhanced forecasting allows grid operators to better manage the distribution and storage of energy, ensuring that supply meets demand efficiently. As solar energy is intermittent, having accurate predictions helps prevent imbalances and reduces the risk of grid instability or blackouts. AI-driven solutions also enable more effective use of energy storage systems, ensuring that excess energy produced during peak sunlight hours is stored and used during low-generation periods. The integration of solar energy, battery storage, and artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming important in the renewable energy market, especially for grid decarbonization… AI models help optimize when and how energy should be stored or distributed, ensuring a consistent flow of carbon-free power, even during non-peak production hours. With growing investments in energy storage and AI capabilities, the solar sector is evolving into a more efficient, responsive, and sustainable energy market. This trend signifies a shift toward more advanced grid integration technologies that will drive the next wave of clean energy innovation.” PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) and Smartlink AI (“Orbit AI”) to Launch the First “Orbital Cloud” for AI Infrastructure into Space PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (NEO: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (“PowerBank” or the “Company"), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is collaborating with Orbit AI in the launch of a revolutionary space initiative known as the Orbital Cloud — where communications, compute, and verification converge in LEO powered by Solar energy. The mission leverages cutting-edge satellite technology, high-performance AI compute hardware, blockchain verification systems, and clean-energy solutions to demonstrate a next-generation digital infrastructure in orbit. Strategic Vision - Orbit AI is developing DeStarlink, the first decentralized low-Earth-orbit network for global connectivity, and DeStarAI, a suite of orbital AI data centers powered by solar arrays and naturally cooled in space. Together, these systems form the Orbital Cloud, a unified infrastructure layer designed to enable sovereign, censorship-resistant connectivity and in-orbit compute services. Through its collaboration with Orbit AI, PowerBank intends to contribute advanced solar energy systems and adaptive thermal control solutions, reflecting its broader shift toward digital asset, data center, and RWA (Real World Asset) infrastructure, where solar power supports digital infrastructure deployments and high-growth AI markets. PowerBank’s contribution focuses on solar power and adaptive thermal technologies essential to future satellite’s “Execution Layer.” “The next frontier of human innovation isn’t just in space exploration, it’s in building the infrastructure of tomorrow above the Earth,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank. “The combined markets for orbital satellites, in-orbit data centers, blockchain verification, and solar-powered digital infrastructure are projected to exceed $700 billion over the next decade. By integrating solar energy with orbital computing, PowerBank is helping create a globally sovereign, AI-enabled digital layer in space, which is a system that can help power finance, communications, and critical infrastructure.” “Orbit AI is creating the first truly intelligent layer in orbit — satellites that compute, verify, and optimize themselves autonomously,” said Gus Liu, Co-Founder and CEO of Smartlink AI. “The Orbital Cloud turns space into a platform for AI, blockchain, and global connectivity. By leveraging solar-powered compute payloads and decentralized verification nodes, we are opening an entirely new potentially $700+ billion-dollar market opportunity — one that combines energy, data, and sovereignty to reshape industries from finance to government and Web3. PowerBank’s expertise in advanced solar energy systems will be significant in supporting this initiative.” As Jeff Bezos recently commented at Italian Tech Week, Turin, Italy, October 2025[1]: “We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centres in space in the next couple of decades. These giant training clusters will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7 — no clouds, no rain, no weather. It already has happened with weather and communication satellites. The next step is going to be data centres and then other kinds of manufacturing.” CONTINUED… Read this and more news for PowerBank Corporation at: https://powerbankcorp.com/news/ In other recent developments and happenings in the Artificial Intelligence market include: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stepped back into the U.S. bond market for the first time since 2022, raising $15 billion as it continues pouring money into AI infrastructure. The company issued the debt in six parts, according to an SEC filing, giving itself extra room to fund acquisitions, boost working capital, pay down existing debt and, if needed, support stock buybacks. Demand for the deal was huge right out of the gate. People familiar with the sale told Bloomberg that orders climbed close to $80 billion before easing once borrowing costs improved during the process. Even with the cooldown, the enthusiasm shows how willing investors are to back Big Tech's AI ambitions. It isn't just Amazon: Alphabet recently sold $25 billion across the U.S. and Europe, Meta raised $30 billion in October and Oracle secured $18 billion earlier this year. China approved the first foreign automaker generative-AI services this week, clearing Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) to offer in-car AI assistants to Chinese drivers. Regulators in Shanghai registered Tesla's xBot customer-service model, while Beijing's cyberspace authority listed Mercedes-Benz's virtual assistant. The approvals let both firms deploy voice assistants that handle customer queries, navigation and media controls after meeting local cybersecurity, data-localization and content-safety requirements. Volvo's cockpit assistant also secured registration in Shanghai, showing regulators will accept foreign models that localize operations. Marking a new era of industrial innovation, SymphonyAI, a global leader in Vertical AI product platforms, announced a milestone integration of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Omniverse™ libraries into its IRIS Foundry DataOps platform and IRIS Forge application builder, running on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure cloud and edge infrastructure. Unlike static digital-twin tools, this integration brings live industrial data into 3D digital twins developed using Omniverse libraries, enabling teams to simulate entire plants or production lines in minutes instead of weeks—reducing the time to insight and accelerating operational improvements. Unveiled at Microsoft Ignite, this integration brings together transformative 3D modeling, real-time simulation, and enterprise-grade AI to accelerate digital transformation for refineries, manufacturers, energy producers, and process industry leaders worldwide. As industrial organizations increasingly move from AI pilots to full-scale production, they face complex challenges: how to visualize and optimize diverse, distributed operations in real time; how to break down data silos across sites and assets; and how to empower teams with actionable insight for better, faster decisions. This solution—integrating NVIDIA Omniverse libraries into IRIS Foundry, running in Microsoft Azure—enables users to build dynamic applications within minutes using IRIS Forge. These applications support collaborative simulations, 3D visualizations, and interactive modelling, while enhancing operational intelligence and allowing one-click deployment to the Azure cloud. Built on Microsoft Azure’s cloud and edge infrastructure, the integration uses Azure Kubernetes Service for orchestration, Azure Entra ID for secure access, Azure Edge Runtime for near-real-time processing, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for native connectivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams.

Stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open after four straight days of declines for the benchmark S&P 500; Investors are bracing for the latest quarterly earnings report from Nvidia, due after the closing bell Wednesday; Lowe's shares are surging after the home improvement giant reported solid earnings a day after rival Home Depot missed profit estimates; Target shares are lower after the retailer reported a larger drop in sales than analysts had forecast; and the Department of Energy is backing a loan to help Constellation Energy reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly higher as investors digest earnings reports from major retailers and prepare for the highly anticipated release of quarterly results from AI chipmaker Nvidia later today. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The Dow and the S&P 500 have closed lower in each of the past four sessions, while the Nasdaq is riding a two-day losing streak as tech stocks have been under pressure. Bitcoin was at $91,500 recently, down from around $93,000 yesterday afternoon but up from an overnight low of near $90,000. Gold futures were up 1.3% at $4,120 an ounce, gaining ground for the first time in five days, while crude oil futures slipped 2.5% to $59.25 per barrel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide range of loans, was little changed, around 4.11%. Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker at the center of the AI boom, is scheduled to release its highly anticipated earnings report after the market closes this afternoon. The report comes as anxiety has built across the market in recent weeks that excitement around AI has created a bubble in the stock market. The chipmaker, which is the world's most valuable company by market capitalization, is expected to report rising revenue and profits. Nvidia shares are expected move significantly after the results are released, which is bound to have a big impact on the broader market and investors in general. The stock, which has lost nearly 15% of its value since hitting an all-time high in late October, was up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Shares of Lowe's Companies (LOW) are rising this morning after the retailer reported strong profits, a day after rival Home Depot's (HD) profits fell short of expectations. Lowe's reported third-quarter earnings per share of $3.06, up from $2.89 a year earlier and topping Wall Street estimates, while sales of $20.81 billion were roughly in line with expectations. The company also lifted its full-year sales outlook to $86 billion, up from $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion, and forecast adjusted earnings per share of $12.25, compared with a previous projection of $12.20 to $12.45. Lowe's credited the shift in guidance to "ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment," along with including the impact of recently-acquired Foundation Building Materials. Lowe's shares were up more than 5% in recent premarket trading. Target (TGT) shares are losing ground after the retail giant reported revenue for the third quarter that came in below analysts' estimates. The company's revenue fell 1.5% from a year ago to $25.27 billion, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.78, topping the analyst consensus. Comparable store sales fell 3.8% for Target's retail locations, partially offset by a 2.4% gain in comparable sales online. Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is slated to take over as CEO in February, said the quarter was in line with Target's expectations "despite multiple challenges continuing to face our The retailer also narrowed its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $7.00 to $8.00, versus $7.00 to $9.00 previously. Shares were down 3% in premarket trading. Shares of Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) are rising this morning, a day after the Department of Energy announced its support for a deal involving the power provider. The DOE said Tuesday that it is providing Constellation with a $1 billion loan to help the company restart activity at the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility in Pennsylvania. Last year, Constellation and tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) announced a deal that would see Constellation restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor and provide its power to run some of Microsoft's data centers in the area. Constellation shares were up more than 2% recently.

Commentary: Platforms that once helped us stay in touch have become fractured and impersonal -- and AI slop and deepfakes are making it so much worse. Social media is becoming more unbearable, thanks to AI. Social media has never been lauded for realism, but online deceit is reaching a fever pitch. Since the inception of platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, aspirational content has flooded our feeds with too-perfect bodies, homes and lifestyles. Despite the supposed aim of social media to keep us connected, going online increasingly feels isolating and detached from reality. AI slop and deepfakes are making it infinitely worse. The emergence of generative AI tools like OpenAI's Sora, Google's Veo and Midjourney has facilitated the creation of videos that are all at once extraordinary, imaginative and deceptive. Suddenly, a simple text prompt can conjure anything you think up. It's a technological marvel, and, oftentimes, an ethical nightmare. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. AI slop refers to the endless barrage of low-quality digital content created with artificial intelligence. You've likely seen examples of this on your social media feeds, from videos of animals exhibiting oddly human characteristics to pranks and gags that seem to defy the laws of physics. In addition, deepfakes of public figures, both alive and dead, saying and doing things that never actually happened have become a hot -- and contentious -- commodity. It's not just shoddy AI that's diminishing the online experience. Filtering through more convincing fabrications of people, places and events demands more vigilance than ever, and it's utterly exhausting. Ever since the rollout of OpenAI's Sora app in September, I've wondered why anyone would want to scroll through a feed made up solely of artificial moments. Even more "traditional" social platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become inundated with AI content that seemingly serves no real purpose, beyond demonstrating the astonishingly lifelike imagery that AI tools can now conjure in an instant. Isn't the point of social media to stay in touch with people you know and to follow public figures that interest you? Is that foundational objective officially dead? "The cynical answer is that social media is now aimed at keeping you connected to the tool, rather than to each other," said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of Cornell Tech's Security, Trust and Safety Initiative. Tech giants are "making their stock price go up" by showing off their AI capabilities, he said, but "it's coming at the expense of the experience on these platforms." Indeed, that heightened artificiality clashes with the authenticity many of us seek and increasingly struggle to find online. One of the reasons I fell in love with TikTok years ago is that it's easier to find more genuine, unfiltered content -- a welcome relief from the overly polished influencer posts flooding my Instagram feed, although I increasingly see my fair share of that on TikTok, too. Even before the rise of generative AI, Instagram updates from friends and family have largely been supplanted by content from high-profile creators I don't follow. That's not always a bad thing, as it often exposes me to topics I want to see more of. That focus on user interests is what makes TikTok's algorithm in particular so powerful (and addictive). But it makes me feel even more disconnected from the people I actually do know -- especially since everyday folks are seemingly posting less nowadays. Factor AI into that equation, and any semblance of authenticity fades away. Now, along with battling feelings of insecurity from seeing touched-up images of real people, you may also stumble upon vacation photos that are entirely AI-generated, or come across an AI influencer that amplifies unattainable beauty standards. "Before, we had the problem of unrealistic body expectations," Mantzarlis said. "And now we're facing the world of unreal body expectations." It's becoming harder for people to separate fact from fiction, but the dissemination of slop and deepfakes isn't slowing down. The clock is ticking for platforms to regulate this new wave of content before it drowns out our sense of reality. Social media companies like Meta and TikTok have pledged to label AI-generated content and ban harmful posts such as fake crisis events or the use of private individuals' likenesses without their permission. On Wednesday, TikTok said it'll start testing a new control for people to choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their feeds. Pinterest rolled out a similar feature last month. But in the absence of government regulation -- which is lagging due to factors like political gridlock over how to regulate AI, lobbying from tech firms (Meta recently launched a super PAC to push back on AI laws) and the rapid rate at which the technology is evolving -- it's up to companies to uphold their own policies. It can admittedly be tricky for sites to flag everything given the sheer volume of content, but so far, their perfunctory efforts don't seem very promising. That lack of regulation can magnify distrust and discord online. An August study by Raptive, a media company that works with digital creators, found that when people merely suspected content was AI-generated, they instinctively distanced themselves from it. Specifically, 48% of respondents found the content to be less trustworthy, while 60% said they felt a lower emotional connection to it. But with influencer-created content dominating most social platforms these days, AI can be marketed as a way to simplify a traditionally time-consuming process. "AI tools make it easier for more people to be creators," said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at Raptive. "It increases the footprint of who can be a creator much faster." Chatting with Bannister helped to offset a bit of my skepticism; he reminded me that "like any new technology, there are always good and bad uses." Along with AI slop, he noted, there's still human creativity behind the (oftentimes ridiculous) AI content we see online. "There will be lots of junk and bumps in the road and problems, but maybe this can create amazing new forms of information-sharing and entertainment," Bannister said. "There's still so much junk flowing through the system that we don't know what that outcome is going to be." There's another side to what AI is capable of: "It's going to be used for further exacerbating tensions, for confirming people's pre-existing biases," Mantzarlis said. Social media is already an echo chamber for reaffirming people's harmful, close-minded viewpoints and rapidly spreading misinformation. I'm not sure we're prepared for just how much worse that can get when everyone has the power to easily manufacture their own reality and share it with the world. The fracturing of society is only going to show wider cracks. If anything, I'd appreciate it if more platforms gave us the option to dial down how much AI we see on our feeds. Though given the choice, I'd dial it all the way down to zero.

Joint venture to deliver up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030, starting with a 100 MW deployment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to power the Global AI ecosystem with cost-efficient, high-performance infrastructure News Summary WASHINGTON, D.C. – November 19, 2025 – AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN, a PIF company delivering global full-stack AI solutions, announced today plans to establish a joint venture aimed to support the development of Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading provider of world-class AI solutions for regional and global customers. AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN will serve as founding investors in the joint venture, which is expected to begin operations in 2026 with plans to combine HUMAIN’s state-of-the-art data centers with AMD and Cisco technology, delivering modern data center capacity with efficient power and lower capital expenditures. AMD and Cisco will act as exclusive technology partners to the joint venture, contributing their portfolio of products and services to its development of up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030. The companies also announced the first phase of the project as a buildout of 100 MW AI infrastructure, with the intent to include HUMAIN modern data center capacity, AMD Instinct™ MI450 Series GPUs and Cisco’s industry-leading critical infrastructure. Powering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s AI Driven Economy Earlier this year, Cisco and AMD announced a landmark initiative with HUMAIN to help build the world’s most open, scalable, resilient and cost-efficient AI infrastructure. Today’s announcement advances this partnership with plans for a joint venture to accelerate transformation and provide cost-effective infrastructure to power customers’ AI use cases. Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO of AMD, said: “Delivering high-performance global AI infrastructure at scale requires strong partnerships. Together with HUMAIN and Cisco, we’re combining leadership compute and networking technologies to expand the capacity and global competitiveness of the Kingdom’s AI ecosystem. As part of this deepening collaboration, we’re also establishing an AMD Center of Excellence in Saudi Arabia to further accelerate local integration and innovation.” Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO of Cisco said: “Our expanded partnership with HUMAIN, together with AMD, will mark a pivotal moment in accelerating Saudi Arabia’s AI infrastructure. By providing secure, scalable, critical infrastructure for HUMAIN’s up to 1 GW buildout, Cisco will help the Kingdom turn its vision for a digitally advanced, AI-powered economy into a reality.” Tareq Amin, CEO of HUMAIN said: “Our partnership with AMD and Cisco brings world-class technology and expertise to our mission. Together, we are pushing the frontier of AI compute, bringing up to 1 GW of high-performance, cost-efficient infrastructure online in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to empower innovators both in the Kingdom and around the world.” The collaboration reflects the ambition to create a dynamic, AI-driven economy. Cisco’s latest AI Readiness Index shows that while 91% of Saudi organizations plan to deploy AI agents, only 29% currently have robust GPU capacity, highlighting the urgent need for advanced data center infrastructure. These findings point to an urgent need for the scalable, high-performance AI infrastructure which AMD, Cisco and HUMAIN are building together. The collaboration is not only expected to deliver the compute capacity required for AI at scale but also strengthens the foundations of Saudi Arabia’s digital economy, supporting goals to localize innovation, talent, and technology.

Title: SGX tie-up with Nasdaq to streamline dual listings among moves to boost Singapore's equities market

Singapore The proposal is still subject to the completion of relevant regulatory processes. If successful, companies interested in an IPO can use a single set of offering documents to list on both exchanges concurrently. The Singapore Exchange logo (left) outside the company headquarters on Mar 23, 2023; and the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, US, on Mar 26, 2024. (File photos: AFP/Roslan Rahman, Reuters/Brendan McDermid) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Companies may soon be able to concurrently list on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Nasdaq, enabling companies to access capital across Asia and North America, announced the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday (Nov 19). While the proposal for a dual listing bridge is subject to the completion of relevant regulatory processes, MAS will work with SGX to consult on the regulatory framework for a set of prospectus disclosure requirements comparable to that in the US, it said. This means companies that are interested in an initial public offering (IPO) can use a single set of offering documents to list on both exchanges concurrently, cutting down on regulatory friction and cost, MAS said. The cross-border listing framework will allow companies with a market capitalisation of S$2 billion (US$1.5 billion) and above to access global capital, investors and liquidity, said SGX and Nasdaq in a joint press release on Wednesday. With the bridge in place, companies will be able to simultaneously list on SGX and the US exchange, and dual-listed shares registered in the US can be settled on SGX and vice versa. This is one of the measures announced by the Equities Market Review Group, which was set up to give recommendations on how to strengthen the development of Singapore's stock market. MAS set up the review group in 2024 after SGX had its worst year for listings in 2023. The review group is led by Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat, who was Second Minister for Finance at the time. He is also the deputy chairman of MAS. At a press conference on Wednesday concluding the review, Mr Chee said: "We are still very keen to attract companies to list on the SGX mainboard, just as Nasdaq will still be very keen to attract companies to list on Nasdaq. "But we both see this as an additional option that some companies could find attractive, could find useful, and so this will help us to be able to enlarge the pie for both Nasdaq and SGX." For example, a company may be considered large by Singapore or Asian standards, but may end up "becoming smaller fish in a much bigger pond" if they were to list on Nasdaq on its own, he added. With the draw of both US and Singapore liquidity pools, the new board will support efforts to attract more Asian issuers into the Singapore ecosystem, said Mr Chee. The new board is envisaged to go live around mid-2026, he added. The announcements come amid growing interest in new SGX listings from corporates while MAS rolled out the review group's previous recommendations. The third quarter of 2025 saw more IPOs than in the whole of 2024. The Straits Times Index closed last week at 4,546.07 after hitting a new all-time high of 4,575.91, delivering a 25.8 per cent total return for the year to Nov 14. MAS also announced a "value unlock" programme to help listed companies "strengthen investor engagement and sharpen their focus on shareholder value creation". This includes S$30 million (US$23 million) allocated to two grants to build competencies in corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations, MAS said. MAS added that it had appointed a second batch of six more asset managers to the S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme – one of the several measures proposed by the review group to boost Singapore's stock market. From the remaining sum, S$2.85 billion has been allocated to Amova Asset Management, AR Capital, BlackRock, Eastspring Investments (Singapore), Lion Global Investors and Manulife Investment Management (Singapore). MAS appointed the first three asset managers in July to manage S$1.1 billion under the programme, which involves putting money with fund managers focused on investing in Singapore stocks. At the time, more than 100 global, regional and local firms had expressed interest in the programme. A total of S$3.95 billion has been allocated to nine asset managers. The central bank will continue to review the remaining submissions and the next phase of appointments is expected in the second quarter of 2026. The review group also announced other trading and market structure enhancements: To oversee the implementation of these measures, MAS will establish an Equity Market Implementation Committee, co-chaired by its managing director Chia Der Jiun and SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye. Adding that there has been "some encouraging development" since the review began in August 2024, Mr Chee said Singapore's equities market has performed well overall. "Building a stronger equities market, we know it cannot be done by any single organisation. There's no silver bullet to battle this set of challenges that we used to face," he added. The government wants to continue collaborating with industry partners going forward, to continue finding new growth areas for Singapore's financial services industry, especially in a more turbulent environment, said the minister. "But we must, while we're doing this, also remind ourselves that we've got to be prepared to take some risks, calculated risks," said Mr Chee. "We want to enhance the competitiveness of our ecosystem, we want to increase our chances of being able to implement transformative change. We may not always succeed." Mr David Gerald, president and CEO of the Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) lauded the "value unlock" initiatives, adding that listed companies are typically "very shy" about communicating with retail investors. He said the grants would help firms better train their officers to market their business growth journeys as well as their valuations and plans. This would encourage investors to look at how the company's stock is performing, he added. "Singapore companies are not having enough liquidity. If you can spur the local investors to do more for you, and if more companies come out and do these things and not hide behind annual reports ... they need to communicate more regularly." CEO of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID), Mr Terence Quek, said the moves by MAS will function as "a shot in the arm" for the local equities market and spark more interest in local-listed firms. The latest announcements show that the review group took a deep dive into the issue while listening to feedback from key stakeholders, including directors of listed entities, he added. "Boards and directors will also need to step up. SID will continue to play a key role in supporting boards with the capabilities, professionalism and governance standards they need to operate in this new landscape," said Mr Quek. To support the "value unlock" programme, SID will launch a series of programmes to help directors develop competencies in the area of corporate strategy, capital optimisation and investor relations and stakeholder engagement, he added. The dual listing bridge makes it clear that Singapore is “going all out” to attract listings of large high-quality companies, said joint managing partner of TSMP Law Corporation Stefanie Yuen-Thio, who is a member of the Corporate Governance Advisory Committee. “With geopolitical tensions still running high, it makes sense for companies to develop an investor base on both sides of the world,” she added. An SGX and Nasdaq dual listing would provide 24-hour coverage and trading of stocks and “not make the listed company look too US-focused”, she said. The S$5 billion allocated to asset managers pumps “much needed” liquidity into lesser known but good quality stocks, said Ms Yuen-Thio. “It’s a good start but you cannot lift a market just by pumping in capital. You also need to equip companies, which is what the ‘value unlock’ program seeks to do.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app

Title: What Dimensional’s Dual-Share-Class Approval Means for Advisors

This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com The SEC approved the first dual share classes of ETFs and mutual funds this week, meaning advisors won’t have to choose between the two wrappers, effectively letting them order the surf and turf. Dimensional Fund Advisors on Tuesday received the long-awaited exemption, which could become one of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s most significant decisions since the ETF Rule in 2019. Almost 80 other companies, including major asset managers like BlackRock, State Street and JP Morgan, are still waiting in line for the green light. While the eventual benefits of the decision may take years to develop, experts agree it’s a major milestone for the industry that could reshape how financial advisors use the funds inside client portfolios. Plus, nobody likes choosing between the steak or the lobster. “We anticipate Dimensional will be the first firm to offer an actively managed ETF share class of an existing mutual fund,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research and editorial at TMX VettaFi. “Demand for actively managed ETFs has never been stronger.” For advisors, new products that utilize dual share classes will likely blend the advantages of the ETF wrapper with the scale and reach of traditional mutual funds. They could also help ETFs enter the 401(k) landscape. Dimensional, one of the country’s largest active ETF issuers, can now extend key ETF features to existing mutual funds, like the creation and redemption mechanism that can help boost tax efficiencies. Dimensional had applied to add exchange-traded fund share classes to 13 of its US equity funds, according to a release. Some of them include: Managers still have their work cut out for them, however. The challenges will be navigating the significant back-office reporting issues and ensuring investors fully understand the structure, Rosenbluth added. “Gaining approval for an ETF share class and successfully launching one are two different things,” he said. Dimensional said the first batch of selected funds were the least operationally complex to transition, but additional candidates are expected to follow. “We expect many other asset managers will observe this rollout carefully before adopting a similar approach,” Rosenbluth said. I’ll Take Two: There will certainly be winners and losers. Historically, the easing of regulations has tended to favor the biggest brand names, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. For example, after the ETF Rule went into effect, almost 60% of active ETFs assets went to just five issuers, though it could also benefit boutique managers with strong track records. “Mutual fund managers who lack both strong brand recognition and a track record of past performance will likely face a twin threat: downward fee pressure and difficulty in attracting ETF inflows,” he said. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds.

Title: Why CLO ETFs Are Picking Up Steam

Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Collateralized debt obligations got a bad rap from movies like “The Big Short.” But the story could be different for their cousin, collateralized loan obligations. Issuers are diving into the world of exchange-traded funds that invest in CLOs. Janus Henderson recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch another CLO strategy, while Reckoner Capital Management proposed four such ETFs earlier this month. The appeal stems from their high yields relative to other bond funds and the recent period of high interest rates. The new funds also reflect investors’ appetite for risk-on strategies as more of these products enter the arena. “During that rising rate period … [CLO ETFs] just happened to stand out as an asset class that people thought was interesting,” said Paul Olmsted, senior analyst of fixed income strategies at Morningstar. “It’s a yield play.” The new Janus fund will invest in AA- and A-rated CLOs, which are higher risk than AAA bonds (that have never defaulted) but could also potentially yield higher returns. Janus Henderson was the first to offer CLOs in an ETF wrapper, launching JAAA in 2020 and giving investors access to a broad array of collateralized loan obligations, or investments in companies that make loan payments; investors see yield when the corporations pay off their debts. Other funds from BlackRock (CLOA) and VanEck (CLOI) hit the market in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The three largest CLO ETFs available today include: Go With the CLO: The recent surge of CLO strategies may also stem from a growing interest in private credit, and the expansion of institutional-grade investments to retail investors. Still, there is always some risk involved in CLO investments, particularly lower-grade loans (like BBB or BB loans), even if corporations are the ones paying the loans. Olmsted advises to “stick with the bigger ones.” “It’s so important that people are doing their due diligence,” Olmsted said. “If you look at some of the smaller names out there, just be aware and make sure that they have a reasonable track record.” This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services.

Title: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows

US Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $3 billion in November outflows as a fresh death cross, fading Fed rate cut odds, and smart money shorts weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are closing in on $3 billion in net outflows for November, putting the products on track for their worst month yet after BlackRock’s fund logged its biggest day of redemptions on record. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs extended their five-day losing streak Tuesday, logging another $372 million in net negative outflows, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $523 million in outflows, marking its largest day of outflows since its debut in January 2024. The latest outflows bring November’s total to $2.96 billion, already making it the second-worst month for spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock alone accounted for $2.1 billion of those outflows. Another week of selling could push redemptions past the $3.56 billion seen in February, which would mark the weakest month for ETF flows despite the historical tendency for November to be one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $866M in second-worst day on record, but some analysts still bullish The ETF outflows have continued to mount despite investors expecting a month of upside for Bitcoin, based on historical data. November is the best month for Bitcoin’s historic returns, with BTC averaging a 41.22% rally during the month, according to CoinGlass data. Looking at other crypto funds, the Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $74.2 million in outflows on Tuesday, while the Solana (SOL) ETFs attracted $26.2 million in inflows, surpassing $421 million in total investments since launch, according to Farside Investors. Related: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin gains fall 39% as October crash pressures corporate treasuries Bitcoin printed this cycle’s fourth “death cross” last week, a technical chart pattern that emerges when an asset’s short-term price momentum indicators fall below the long-term trend. While it is historically considered a “bearish technical signal,” the death cross can also signal a macro bottom ahead of a strong reversal, depending on the wider economic context, Lacie Zhang, research analyst at Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph. Some of the crypto-specific concerns included a warning from Bitmine Immersion’s chairman, Tom Lee, who stated that two major market makers are facing financial deficits, explained the analyst. Meanwhile, markets are pricing in a 46% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut during the Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 10, down from 93.7% a month ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The development inspired a repositioning among the industry’s most successful traders, who are tracked as “smart money” traders on Nansen’s blockchain intelligence platform, for a more short-term downside. Smart money traders have added $5.7 million worth of cumulative short positions in the past 24 hours, signaling downside expectations, as this cohort was net short on Bitcoin for $275 million, according to Nansen.

One thing I’ve been tracking this year is the areas where Wall Street and Silicon Valley are going to war. Tech firms clearly want to become banking apps and receive special charters, private equity and crypto are jostling for position in worker 401(k) plans, and the tech right in general wants to supplant big banks as the go-to director of conservative business policy. That’s all still going on. But in one area, Silicon Valley and Wall Street are in sync: conjuring up sketchy credit deals that are pointing us toward another financial crash. More from David Dayen Last month, the big focus was “round-tripping,” the way that sundry AI and tech companies were investing in their own customers—with Nvidia giving AI companies the investment necessary to buy their graphics processing units (GPUs), and so on. But there’s a lot more to this story, tangled up with yet another rebrand by the former masters of the universe, from “shadow banks” without proper regulation into something boring and neutral-sounding: private credit. Ever since the advent of financial regulation, there have been companies that have attempted to evade the rules with creative branding. Private credit companies are non-banks that are trying to rebrand into a name that doesn’t tell everyone they are unregulated lending vehicles. The speculative financing of the artificial intelligence buildout is happening mostly in private credit, where assets under management hit $1.6 trillion in February and are likely higher today. The deals being made are perverse and irrational; there are huge mismatches between the life cycle of the assets being funded and the amount of time it will take to pay them off. Experts have been doing everything but picketing the stock exchange with signs that say “BUBBLE IN PROGRESS,” yet the country has so much sunk cost in the AI boom that the pathway feels inevitable. “We have sealed the deal on another financial crisis—the question is size,” said one former congressional staffer. I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS as simply as I can. The build-out of computing power for AI needs about $2 trillion in annual revenue by the end of the decade to justify the current and planned investment. It’s an insane amount of money, nobody has it—nobody may ever have it—and so everything being constructed now, from the GPUs needed to train AI models to the data centers housing them to the energy supplying those data centers, needs some creative financing. Big Tech companies have large cash flows, but the trillions needed are too steep even for them. Venture capital isn’t that interested in funding infrastructure either; while the God in the machine that may result from the AI build-out has potential for supercharged returns, data centers and power plants, by themselves, won’t get you there. Related: The AI ouroboros But investors are dying for this kind of investment opportunity, believing that a Big Tech–directed industrial policy will endure for years. Big Tech firms have historically not borrowed much, however, and though companies have issued twice as many bonds this year than at any time in the recent past, they would like to maintain strong credit ratings by limiting debt exposure. Smaller AI companies, meanwhile, don’t have the confidence of the markets to borrow hundreds of billions in capital. Enter the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV). A company pops up to build a data center, and they get an “anchor tenant” that’s a Big Tech firm. (Data centers rent their space to tenants; they are infrastructure, but they’re also like apartment buildings.) It finances the data center through debt sales, implicitly (or explicitly) promising that Big Tech firm payments will pass through to investors. This is the case with an SPV for Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center in Louisiana. Blue Owl, a private credit fund, owns the majority stake in the SPV; it put in a small amount of equity, and the SPV carries the debt. Meta has another 20 percent, which gives investors the confidence that they’ll get repaid without Meta having to put debt on its balance sheet. This has a side effect of highly rating these debt instruments, with “specialized” rating agencies doing much of the work, in ways that are more than suspicious. Blue Owl is a private credit fund, which again is an end run around financial regulations. These companies suck up money from investors, well over a trillion dollars according to The Wall Street Journal. Blue Owl has $295 billion on its own. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. It’s pitched as a bulletproof trade; Big Tech firms are locked into leases, and their payments will pay back the debt. But if that’s the case, why is Blue Owl, in the aftermath of a merger of two of its private credit funds, blocking redemptions in a way that will automatically give those investors 20 percent losses? As a traditional bank, that move would be akin to a bank run; this is just pissing off rich people who got into an arrangement with limited rights. But the warning signs are unmistakable. And it’s not limited to Blue Owl; covenants on corporate debt are gradually being rewritten to protect private credit in the event of a fallout. A great paper from the Center for Public Enterprise lays out additional alarms. Data centers are not lasting infrastructure, or at least the guts inside them aren’t. If the GPUs are working overtime to compute AI models, they may not last more than two years, and high-end AI firms will always want to upgrade to the latest version anyway. (By the way, our friends at Blue Owl are lending money to Elon Musk’s xAI to buy Nvidia GPUs.) But AI firms are extending their depreciation schedules for the GPUs; they’re saying they will last much longer than they likely will. That means overstated revenues, as companies have to purchase far more GPUs than they are admitting publicly, and thence possible financial disaster. Indeed, some of the smaller companies are using loans backed by their GPUs to purchase other GPUs. It also means that these hulking buildings, and the dedicated power plants some of them are constructing in the vicinity, are likely to become stranded assets when the site outlives its usefulness. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Did I mention the securitization? Data centers roll over from construction loans into asset-backed securities, where investors can pick a tranche based on their risk comfort. The CPE report says that 61 percent of the applicable securitizations in this market are coming from data centers. But again, these securitizations happen years into a rapidly depreciating asset. Everyone’s all in on data centers now; we’re in bubble inflation territory, and it’s unclear when it will pop. Of course, the big problem at the end of this road is that there just isn’t enough expected cash flow to pay any of this off. OpenAI lost more than $11.5 billion last quarter, and wants to spend far more in future years. The potential revenue to make up the gap is not anywhere on the horizon. If the Chinese AI models that are more efficient at training—in part because it is possible to reconstruct LLM datasets by purchasing their output—break ahead of the U.S. counterparts, there’s not going to be any way to finance the growing pile of infrastructure and real estate assets being built. But the big AI firms have no interest in efficiency here. The same companies making the models are the ones who own the cloud computing firms that are pushing more compute to everyone. In fact, the money made from cloud compute is subsidizing the model training at Amazon and Microsoft and Google. Everyone is financing the expansion of everyone else. That’s a classic description of a bubble. There’s a whole middleman aspect to this as well, the “neoclouds” that build data centers on spec and rent them out. (CoreWeave is a terrifying debt-ridden entry in this genre.) But I think you get the picture. We have a 2000s housing bubble level of financial engineering on top of a 1920s level of private unregulated lending on top of something bigger than a 1990s internet (or 1870s railroad) level of technology and infrastructure build-out. It’s one bubble to rule them all. WHILE THIS PILE MAY BE CENTERED IN PRIVATE CREDIT, private equity funds, real estate investment trusts, and other vehicles have pieces of it. A Moody’s report last month said that banks have at least $300 billion in loans to private credit. Blue Owl has BlackRock, Invesco, and PIMCO selling the bonds financing the Hyperion data center. Because this is the only thing moving in this economy, everyone on Wall Street wants some of the action, even those who are wary of it. Deutsche Bank, for example, is talking about reducing its exposure to data center risks, including by shorting AI stocks. But within that, the bank has acknowledged that some of its traders had “gone heavy” on financing for data centers. That puts the effort by Trump’s financial regulators to deregulate traditional banking, including the Federal Reserve slashing bank supervision, in a different light. It may be hard for a private credit firm to get bailed out by the government; for the banks, it’s easier. If banks soak up and carry over the debt from the Blue Owls of the world, they have better opportunities to have it effectively extinguished. So while the biggest names swap money back and forth to buy each other’s stuff, these special purpose vehicles and their investors could be left holding the bag. That increasingly could be ordinary retail investors with 401(k) plans. Financial policymakers I’ve talked to are perhaps most alarmed by this part. There are enough people in the know, like Peter Thiel, quietly sidling away from this investment/fiasco that nerves should be pretty frayed if you have any concern about the U.S. economy. Blue Owl’s stock is way down this year, as skepticism with private credit abounds; it fell 6 percent just on Monday. It’s not exactly comforting when Google’s CEO says “no company is going to be immune, including us” if the AI bubble bursts. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: BlackRock clients pull $523m out of Bitcoin positions. Here’s what to expect next for the price

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are offloading their Bitcoin holdings. On Tuesday, the asset management behemoth saw clients pull $523 million out of its flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust. It’s not alone: US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have shed $3 billion so far in November, and are closing in on the $3.5 billion purge levels seen in February, DefiLlama data shows. The broad selloffs come as Bitcoin’s price is still wobbling around the $90,000 mark on the back of a $1.2 trillion selloff of all cryptocurrencies over the past month. “This kind of drift usually means the downtrend is likely to continue,” Georgii Verbitskii, founder of crypto investing app TYMIO, told DL News. “There is a real possibility that we’re entering a prolonged bearish period, with either continued downside or extended choppy trading around $100,000 or lower.” It’s not just crypto-specific factors driving the downward price action, Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO and co-founder of Blueprint Finance told DL News. “Tightening liquidity, higher interest rates, and slower economic growth are all creating economic headwinds and market worry,” Roberts-Huntley said. The selloff reflects a broader deterioration in global risk sentiment as equity markets wobble. Investors are bracing for Nvidia’s earnings report on Wednesday, delayed US jobs data and a divided US Federal Reserve that remains unsure whether interest rate cuts should proceed this year. In the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq logged further losses as investor positioning flips defensive ahead of Nvidia’s third-quarter report and the delayed September jobs data. Nvidia is once again at the centre of a market storm. The $4.4 trillion chipmaker will report earnings on Wednesday, and although analysts expect blockbuster numbers, trader sentiment has turned fragile after weeks of questions over artificial intelligence companies’ valuations. The market is now divided on whether AI stocks are entering a valuation reset. Hedge funds have traded exposure to Nvidia in near-perfect balance. According to Bloomberg, 161 funds increased their positions while 160 reduced them in Q3. Peter Thiel’s Thiel Macro fund fully dumped Nvidia during the same period, selling 537,742 shares. At the same time, SoftBank confirmed it had liquidated its Nvidia stake for $5.83 billion, reallocating capital to other AI ventures. Michael Burry, the legendary investor who shorted the 2008 crash, disclosed that his Scion Asset Management bought put options on Nvidia and Palantir, positions that would benefit from declines in the stock prices. On Tuesday, Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent firm Alphabet, told the BBC that AI investments have elements of “irrationality.” Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson added to market unease earlier this week, saying he sees “increased downside risks to employment” and stressed policymakers must “proceed slowly” as rates approach neutral. That uncertainty has hamstrung rate-cut expectations. The CME FedWatch tool now assigns roughly 49% odds to a December cut, while Polymarket bettors put the probability at 54%.

Title: Nvidia’s earnings could answer the AI bubble question and upend global markets in moment of truth for Magnificent 7

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

November 19, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Platform reaches 2,400+ active co-owners and $320,000 in distributed passive income as institutional giants like BlackRock validate trillion-dollar tokenization opportunity PARIS, France, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global investment landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation as Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization moves from experimental technology to mainstream financial infrastructure. With institutional projections estimating the tokenized asset market could reach $16 trillion by the 2030s, platforms like Binaryx are demonstrating how blockchain-enabled fractional ownership is making previously inaccessible real estate investments available to a broader investor base. According to Deloitte research 'Tokenization of Real Estate: Unlocking New Opportunities (2024)', tokenized private real estate funds alone could achieve $1 trillion in value by 2035, while industry analysis suggests the broader tokenized asset market may reach $16 trillion or more within the decade. This shift has attracted major institutional players, with BlackRock targeting $10 trillion in tokenized assets and launching its BUIDL Fund on the Ethereum blockchain. "Tokenization isn't hype — it's infrastructure,". "When BlackRock talks trillions and launches products, this is no longer a pilot program. This represents a fundamental shift in how ownership, liquidity, and investment function in the 21st century." Binaryx: From Startup to 34 Tokenized Properties in Three Years Binaryx, a tokenized real estate platform, exemplifies this transformation in practice. In just three years, the platform has grown from five properties to 34 tokenized real estate assets across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, with: The platform has optimized its operational processes more than 10 times over three years, addressing traditional barriers to real estate co-ownership. Where conventional fractional ownership involves thousands of dollars in notarial and legal fees plus operational bureaucracy, Binaryx's DAO-LLC model significantly reduces these barriers. Liquidity: The Game-Changing Advantage Perhaps most significantly, Binaryx enables property share liquidity in approximately 40 minutes to one month — compared to the traditional 2-8 month timeline for real estate transactions. This liquidity advantage addresses one of the fundamental challenges of real estate investment while maintaining exposure to physical asset performance. "Real estate asset tokenization can allow institutional investors to create custom portfolios with tokens that match their investment thesis." by Deloitte. Institutional Validation Accelerates Market Maturity The entrance of institutional capital providers signals market maturity. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly identified tokenization as a key strategic direction, noting that private markets and digital assets are becoming entry points for new investor demographics. JPMorgan and Citi have similarly launched tokenization initiatives, integrating these instruments into their platforms. Market projections indicate compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 20-27% or higher for the tokenized asset sector, driven by: Addressing Risk and Regulatory Considerations Binaryx acknowledges the evolving regulatory landscape, noting that tokenized real estate often falls under securities regulations with jurisdiction-specific requirements⁹. The platform addresses these considerations through: "Technology enables new possibilities, but proper governance, transparent operations, and regulatory compliance remain essential," Oleg Kurchenko, CEO at Binaryx noted. "We've built infrastructure designed for long-term sustainability, not short-term hype." The Democratization of Real Estate Investment For investors, tokenization represents a hybrid instrument combining digital fractional ownership with real income potential — neither pure cryptocurrency speculation nor traditional real estate's capital intensity and illiquidity. "This is the democratization of finance we've discussed for years — actually happening," Oleg concluded. "Platforms like Binaryx prove this isn't theoretical. Properties are operational, income is flowing, and investors are participating in markets that would have been closed to them five years ago." About Binaryx Binaryx is a tokenized real estate investment platform enabling fractional ownership of international properties through blockchain technology. With 34 tokenized properties across Indonesia, Turkey, and Montenegro, Binaryx provides over 2,400 active investors access to real estate co-ownership with enhanced liquidity and reduced barriers to entry. Accessible via mobile app (iOS/Android) and web platform, Binaryx enables investors to browse properties, execute fractional investments, track rental income in real-time, and trade property shares with unprecedented ease and transparency. The platform utilizes DAO-LLC legal structures combined with blockchain tokenization to create accessible, transparent real estate investment opportunities for the global investor community.

Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

Title: Cloudflare Outage Just Made Everyone Paranoid: But Blockchain Kept Working—CZ

DDoS protection giant Cloudflare just went out, paralyzing major corners of the internet. Yet, blockchain networks like Bitcoin remain resilient. Today, Cloudflare suffered a global network issue, causing major services connected to it to slow down or outright stop working. According to the website’s status tracker, it began looking into the issue around noon, UTC. Cloudflare noted it was “experiencing an internal service degradation.” Cloudflare provides a range of internet and cybersecurity-related services, being most known for its “Checking your browser…” DDoS protection page that has become a familiar sight when navigating to some popular websites. About 20% of the global traffic passes through the company, so any issues related to it can have widespread impacts. The outage today clearly showcased it, as it caused issues for thousands of users around the world. Dane Knecht, Cloudflare CTO, posted a statement on X: I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused. Some of the biggest names impacted by the issue included ChatGPT, X, Uber, and McDonald’s. Ironically, even Downdetector, a website that helps users track outages around the internet, itself went down during the event. It took Cloudflare a few hours to get the issue sorted. At 14:42 UTC, the status page reported, “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved.” There were some hiccups post this patch, but they were resolved by 17:44 UTC, as the website updated with, “We are no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.” The market initially reacted to the event, as Cloudflare’s stock dropped to $194, but once the company restored services, its price jumped back to $199. While Cloudflare was dealing with the outage, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao posted on X: “Blockchain kept working.” The remark highlighted the fact that even when 20% of the internet suffered from issues, blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum kept operating normally. Unlike the usual networks that usually have some point of centralization, blockchain networks run in a completely decentralized manner. This means that even if some nodes go offline, the network isn’t affected. Earlier in the year, Amazon’s AWS also experienced a major outage, causing disruption in large parts of the internet. Even then, blockchain networks remained stalwart. As for what caused the latest Cloudflare outage, Knecht has said it was a latent bug in a service related to the company’s bot mitigation capability. It started to crash, cascading into a broad degradation of Cloudflare services. “This was not an attack,” clarified Knecht. The CTO has also shared that an investigation report is on the way, with transparent details related to what happened during the event included. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $93,300, down 9.5% over the last week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Solana Reclaims $140 As Second Wave Of SOL ETFs Debut – Is A Rebound Coming?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Amid the second wave of crypto-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Solana (SOL)-based investment products have been leading the charge, fueled by strong demand despite the recent market volatility. As a new group of investment products based on the altcoin hits the market and SOL’s price starts to recover, some suggest that a rebound could be underway. The second wave of Solana ETFs has arrived in the market after the successful launch of SOL-based investment products. On Monday, VanEck debuted its Solana ETF (VSOL) on Nasdaq, becoming the third investment product based on the altcoin to launch over the past month. According to the announcement, the firm is waiving its 0.30% fee on the first $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) or until February 17, 2026. Meanwhile, its third-party staking provider will also waive its fee for staking services under the same conditions. Adding to the momentum, Fidelity and Canary Capital launched their FSOL and SOLC ETFs on Tuesday, after recently filing 8-A forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Fidelity is “easily the biggest asset manager in this category with BlackRock sitting out,” adding that it is “Game on” with the other launches. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci also highlighted the new launch, but expressed surprise that BlackRock is “sitting this one out” as many anticipate a successful performance. Notably, Bitwise and Grayscale debuted their BSOL and GSOL ETFs at the end of October, registering a record-breaking performance since their launch. Farside Invest data shows that SOL-based investment products have recorded over $390 million in inflows, with 15 consecutive trading days of positive net flows, signaling strong institutional demand for the products. In a Tuesday X post, Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, noted BSOL’s positive performance despite the market correction, affirming that “prices are in the eye of the beholder.” “ETF investors continue to buy the dip. Grateful for the trust in Bitwise to steward investor assets,” he added. Amid the Tuesday launches, SOL’s price bounced 8.4% from its five-month low of $128, recorded on Monday. The cryptocurrency has declined 12% over the past month, losing crucial levels during the market correction. However, Bybit recently suggested that the newly launched investment products could reshape “its price trajectory and market structure for years to come.” In a recent report, the crypto exchange’s analysts noted that the altcoin joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as one of the few digital assets with regulated brokerage access in the US. This “represents a structural shift in how SOL is accessed, traded and perceived,” significantly expanding SOL’s investor base and confidence. “If historical patterns hold, Solana could be on the cusp of a multi-quarter rally that redefines its position in the crypto hierarchy,” the exchange affirmed. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out SOL’s price action, calling it “one of the worst-performing large caps recently.” However, he argued that, because of this, most of its downside liquidity has already been taken out, with “decent liquidity clusters around the $170-$200 level.” To analysts, if the market starts to recover and stabilizes, Solana could rally 20%-40% to retest this area. Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades affirmed that SOL is “putting in quite the reversal relative to its BTC pair,” as the cryptocurrency has broken out of a three-week downtrend against Bitcoin after some failed attempts. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $141, a 25.3% decline in the monthly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Builds Strength for $120K, but Zero Knowledge Proof Becomes the New 100x Presale Everyone’s Rushing Into

Full Content:
Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The cryptocurrency market is entering a defining moment. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to assert its dominance, supported by institutional accumulation and global ETF adoption. At the same time, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is drawing extraordinary attention as its whitelist is now live, introducing a privacy-first vision that could redefine blockchain infrastructure. Together, these two assets, one proven, one emerging, are shaping the narrative of 2025: stability and innovation. Bitcoin represents crypto’s established store of value; ZKP represents the new frontier of private computation and verifiable AI. BTC and ZKP sit on opposite ends of the maturity spectrum but share a common thread, sustained demand driven by utility and institutional interest. Bitcoin’s price performance in late 2025 reflects strong resilience. With macroeconomic uncertainty, fiat inflation, and record ETF inflows, BTC has reclaimed a leading position in risk markets. Analysts cite that Bitcoin is forming a base around $65,000–$70,000, with resistance near $74,000–$80,000, setting the stage for the next potential leg higher. Institutional interest remains the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s growth. Major entities, from BlackRock to Fidelity, have increased exposure through spot ETFs, driving demand that continually absorbs available supply. The 2024 halving has also compressed issuance, reducing daily mining output and pushing BTC closer to a structural supply crunch. Historically, each halving cycle has seen exponential returns within 12–18 months, and analysts at multiple research houses suggest that the Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 could realistically target $100,000–$120,000 if demand continues to rise and ETF participation deepens. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s 200-day moving average remains upward-sloping, a hallmark of bullish continuation. In the near term, BTC may face consolidation between $65,000–$75,000, but the macro structure favors expansion. A decisive breakout above $80,000 could trigger a new cycle phase, with momentum pushing toward six-figure territory. On the downside, the $58,000–$60,000 zone acts as major support, underpinned by whale accumulation and long-term holder conviction. Even in corrective phases, the structural supply scarcity and institutional demand floor keep downside risk relatively constrained. While Bitcoin dominates headlines for institutional adoption, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is defining the next-generation narrative, privacy, AI, and decentralized computation. The ZKP whitelist is live now, and early engagement has been explosive, surpassing 200,000 registrations within the first 24 hours. ZKP’s framework revolves around zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling transactions and computations to be verified without exposing sensitive information. This architecture promises to bridge blockchain, artificial intelligence, and real-world data in a privacy-compliant manner, a theme increasingly sought after by enterprises and regulators alike. What makes ZKP exceptional is its foundation. The project was built with over $100 million in pre-launch, long before a single token was sold. It introduces an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) model, a fair and transparent alternative to conventional presales. Participants contribute daily and receive proportional allocations, ensuring inclusivity and eliminating insider advantages. This combination of real infrastructure, cryptographic rigor, and fair-access mechanics is why analysts are already calling Zero Knowledge Proof the next 100x crypto. The upcoming months could see ZKP become one of the best cryptos for 2025, as privacy and AI narratives converge into mainstream adoption. Analysts believe ZKP’s mix of real infrastructure, transparent tokenomics, and cryptographic innovation could make it the next viral blockchain trend, just as DeFi and layer-2s were in previous cycles. With its whitelist already oversubscribed, ZKP stands out as the most anticipated project in the emerging proof-based AI economy, where privacy and computation integrity become the ultimate currency of trust. Bitcoin and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) symbolize two complementary sides of the crypto revolution. Bitcoin is digital gold, a scarce, decentralized monetary asset recognized globally. ZKP, on the other hand, is a digital infrastructure, a system designed to preserve privacy while powering decentralized computation and AI verification. The combination of the two represents diversification between maturity and innovation. Bitcoin offers long-term store-of-value strength; ZKP provides high-growth exposure to next-gen blockchain technologies. While Bitcoin’s upside may appear steady and predictable, ZKP’s potential lies in early positioning. As its whitelist remains open, early contributors are effectively gaining front-row access to a project that could define how blockchains interact with AI, compliance, and confidential data in the years ahead. Together, they reflect where crypto is heading: one asset securing wealth, the other securing data. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 remains structurally bullish. With ETF inflows, halving-driven scarcity, and growing corporate adoption, BTC’s path toward $100,000–$120,000 appears plausible over the next year. Macro conditions, especially declining interest rates or renewed fiat devaluation, could serve as major accelerators. Simultaneously, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioning itself, fueled by its open whitelist, $100M infrastructure foundation, and a vision of verifiable, privacy-preserving computation. As ZKP prepares to go viral, it encapsulates the forward edge of blockchain evolution, one where privacy, proof, and AI converge into the next trillion-dollar narrative. Pairing Bitcoin’s resilience with ZKP’s innovation could represent the ultimate dual strategy: exposure to both proven value and the next major leap in blockchain utility.

Title: WhatsApp owns India! - by Dharmesh Ba
URL: https://newsletter.theindianotes.com/p/whatsapp-owns-india
Time Published: 2025-11-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
India’s most used business software isn’t chosen - it’s tolerated. Over the past 18 months, I poured lakhs of rupees and time into building automation tools on top of WhatsApp - and failed. That failure opened up something bigger: a look into the tangled web that holds up India’s messaging infrastructure. This is everything good, bad, and quietly dangerous about WhatsApp - and our growing dependence on it. It’s quite a long read. In 2023, I met a cosmetic store owner in Nagpur who had accidentally invented demand forecasting. He sells beauty products - Korean serums, Indian sunscreens, foreign moisturizers. His challenge wasn’t competition or pricing. It was more existential: his shelf space could hold maybe 200 SKUs, but his customers now wanted access to 2,000. Ten years ago, this wasn’t a problem. A woman would walk into his store, and he’d guide her. “Try this Lakmé sunscreen. Let me show you how to apply it.” He hired young women specifically for this - people who could explain products, who could teach. But Instagram changed the game. Women no longer came to his store to discover products. They came with screenshots, asking for specific Korean brands they’d seen on reels. If he didn’t have it, they left. And he couldn’t stock everything. So he invented a system. He joined a vendor WhatsApp group - wholesalers who posted about new products arriving in the market. When something looked promising, he’d post the image to his WhatsApp status. Or he’d share it in a customer group he’d built over years. Then he’d wait. If even two or three people asked for the price, he knew there was demand. He’d place an order before the product even touched his shelf. He wasn’t using WhatsApp for communication and marketing alone but turned it into a just-in-time inventory system. This was India’s answer to the Shopify + Stripe stack. Discovery happened on Instagram. Demand validation happened on WhatsApp Status. Payment happened on UPI. Small businesses had discovered that consumer apps could be hacked into business tools. In this WhatsApp owns India’s communications layer. And unlike every other tech platform, there’s no competitor even close. Instagram competes with Twitter and YouTube. WhatsApp has... nothing. This creates both opportunity and danger. WhatsApp isn’t a product Indians use. It’s infrastructure Indians depend on. Infrastructure is different from products. Products are things you choose. Infrastructure is what you assume exists. You don’t think about electricity until the power goes out. You don’t think about roads until they’re blocked. India stopped thinking about WhatsApp years ago. It’s just... there. Assumed. Essential. This matters because of a simple truth: when something becomes infrastructure, its problems stop being individual frustrations and start being citizen problems. A business owner spending two hours a day manually managing WhatsApp groups isn’t just inefficient - it’s a productivity tax on the entire economy. WhatsApp work messages and personal messages in groups - it’s a design failure that affects work-life balance for millions. The question isn’t whether India needs better WhatsApp tools. The question is whether WhatsApp, as designed by Meta for Meta’s goals, can ever serve as the infrastructure India needs. To answer that, we need to understand what WhatsApp actually is - and what it isn’t. Most people think WhatsApp is a single app. It isn’t. Meta offers three distinct products with different users: WhatsApp: The everyday consumer app WhatsApp Business: A mobile app for small businesses, with profiles, catalogs, chat labels, and auto-replies to manage customer chats. WhatsApp Business API: Not an app but infrastructure - an API (via Meta Cloud or Business Solution Partners [1]) that connects WhatsApp to CRMs or back-end systems for large-scale messaging. Bottom line: one phone number can be linked to only one WhatsApp product at a time. If it’s registered on the WhatsApp Business API, it can’t also be used on the standard app - and vice versa. Though WhatsApp has rolled out a recent workaround. Here’s the critical part: these three “WhatsApps” behave very differently The consumer app and the WhatsApp Business mobile app expose full phone UIs (groups, stories, calls, broadcast lists, catalogs) that people and small shops use directly on an app. But the WhatsApp Business API historically only supported a subset of the app features and couldn’t do many of the interactive, UI-driven fetures that make WhatsApp feel like WhatsApp. For example, you cannot create or manage groups, post WhatsApp Status, or manage channels via APIs yet. Update: Meta has added Groups endpoints and a Calling API to the WhatsApp Business Platform. You can now automate some group actions and initiate voice calls via the API - within tight limits and platform rules. As of Oct 28, 2025 there’s still no official API to post Status Updates like the mobile app. In short: when small businesses say “we run everything on WhatsApp,” they usually mean the consumer or Business mobile apps - with manual groups, broadcasts, and catalogs. True automation and scale require the Business Platform/API, which is powerful but not really designed for typical SME needs. WhatsApp’s business model is simple. Meta charges per message on the WhatsApp Business API, with rates varying by country and message type (Marketing, Utility, Authentication, Service). Businesses can reply free of charge within 24 hours of a user’s message; after that, only approved templates can be sent - and those cost money. In India, rates are about ₹0.78 for marketing and ₹0.11 for utility/authentication messages. Example: 10,000 marketing messages = ₹7,800; 1,000,000 = ₹7.8 lakh monthly. Businesses can use the platform directly via Meta’s Cloud API or through Business Solutions Providers like Gupshup, WATI, Interakt, or Twilio. BSPs add their own fees on top of Meta’s, so prices include markups and platform charges. Most WhatsApp SaaS vendors sell both software and message credits - earning largely from those markups. When Meta changes rates, profits shrink or costs rise for customers, creating instability. The pricing volatility makes WhatsApp a shaky base for predictable business models. Here’s a paradox: The businesses that most need WhatsApp automation are the ones least able to use it. For instance, one of the most common patterns we’ve seen is business owners consistently updating their WhatsApp status each morning with details about the day’s fresh vegetables, sharing posts about new stock in their groups, and responding to customer inquiries within minutes. These actions have become almost daily rituals for entrepreneurs running their businesses on WhatsApp. Such simple automations today are not possible on the main WhatsApp mobile apps but only possible in their API version. Most small businesses in India use one phone number for everything - personal and work. But the WhatsApp Business API needs a separate, dedicated number that can’t run on the regular or Business app. Porting the existing number would mean losing existing chats and giving up the mobile app and certain crucial features like groups management and WhatsApp status posting. Without the WhatsApp Business API even simple automations stay out of reach for SMEs Even with an additional number, setup is a pain. You need to link it to Meta Business Manager, create and submit message templates - all buried in Meta’s dashboards. Many small businesses turn to unofficial modified versions (mods) of WhatsApp or to access automation and additional features. GBWhatsApp is the most famous unofficial app that can help you run two accounts, auto-reply, tag chats, and send follow-ups, see deleted messages - without using the official API. These tools work but violate WhatsApp’s rules, risk malware or data leaks, and can lead to account bans. Here are some top features of the WhatsApp ‘mods’ that are helpful for SMEs Auto Reply: Configure automatic replies per message or contact. Message Scheduler: Schedule messages to send at set times. Broadcast to Multiple Groups: Send one message across several groups at once. Multi Account Support: Use two or more WhatsApp accounts on one device. Bypass Forward Limit: Forward messages to unlimited chats. Always Online Mode: Keep your status showing online continuously. It’s a messy market trading serious security and compliance risks for convenience. The irony is almost poetic: WhatsApp became essential infrastructure because it was simple and open to everyone. Yet, the moment businesses try to do anything advanced with it, it turns into a maze. And there’s another catch: most WhatsApp automation tools live on the web, not as mobile apps. Why? Because if you try to launch a mobile app called “WhatsApp for Business” or “WhatsApp Automation,” Meta will hit you with a trademark notice, and Google Play will take it down. So every SaaS company ends up building a web dashboard instead. But the small business owners live on their mobile devices. If the problem were just technical limits, businesses could adapt- learn the rules, find workarounds, move on. But the real instability comes from something deeper: WhatsApp optimizes for Meta’s goals, not yours - and those goals change without warning. That creates systemic unpredictability that businesses quietly pay for. Delivery drops: In 2022–23, marketing messages reached 90–95% of users. By mid-2025, that fell below 75%. Meta added hidden user-level caps to fight spam - no announcement, no numbers. Businesses only found out after delivery cratered. [2] Sudden suspensions: Accounts get blocked - sometimes permanently - for vague policy violations. The appeal process is slow, and while it runs, operations stop cold. [3] Shifting rules: In Oct 2025, WhatsApp quietly banned all “general-purpose AI chatbots.” The term isn’t defined, leaving even compliant tools exposed. [4] Even if you master the tech, pricing, and compliance, you’re still building on shifting ground - where Meta’s priorities decide your uptime. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: these aren’t problems Meta is trying to solve. They’re features of the system working as intended. Meta is an advertising company; ads pay the bills. Every product in their portfolio - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, even Oculus - exists to collect data and sell ads. WhatsApp is the outlier. It’s a messaging tool that, in a different world, might have evolved like Telegram, Slack or Microsoft Teams: an open platform where developers build productivity tools, businesses customize workflows, and ecosystems flourish. But that’s not Meta’s DNA. If WhatsApp opened up like Slack, businesses would build their own solutions. They’d customize the experience. They’d create value that Meta couldn’t capture. From Meta’s perspective, that’s money left on the table. So instead, WhatsApp is being slowly transformed into an ads platform. You’re starting to see it: Ads in WhatsApp Status (already rolling out) Paid WhatsApp channels (in beta) Business messaging in groups Click to WhatsApp ads From a pure business perspective, this makes sense. Why would Meta invest engineering resources to solve a hundred-million-dollar problem (Indian MSME productivity) when they could deploy those same resources toward a billion-dollar opportunity (WhatsApp ads)? To put it bluntly: Meta doesn’t care about your kirana store’s inventory management problem. Not because they’re evil, but because they’re a trillion-dollar company optimizing for trillion-dollar opportunities. WhatsApp will never be the open platform India needs, because Meta’s business model requires it to stay closed. Which raises an obvious question: If WhatsApp can’t serve as the infrastructure India needs, what can? India’s WhatsApp problem isn’t unique. China faced something similar a decade ago - and solved it deliberately. WeChat handles everything WhatsApp does, plus native payments, mini-apps, ride-hailing, food delivery, and government services. The architectural choices Tencent made are precisely what WhatsApp lacks. In WeChat, businesses can send users only 4 marketing messages directly per month through service account. Beyond that, marketing messages get quarantined into a separate subscription feed/folder - visible but segregated from personal conversations. This forces discipline. Every message must justify its existence. The result: businesses target better, users feel less harassed, and the platform maintains trust. WhatsApp has no such limits. Businesses face tiered messaging caps (starting at 1,000 recipients daily for new accounts) but these scale automatically based on quality scores. The only real constraint is cost - and when marketing messages work, companies pay willingly. The incentive structure rewards volume, not restraint. When an employee leaves a Chinese company, their WeChat relationships vanish with them- customer conversations, sales context, years of institutional knowledge, gone. Tencent solved this with WeCom (WeChat Work), a parallel app for professional communication. In WeCom, workplace conversations belong to the company, not the employee. When someone leaves, their account transfers. Customer relationships survive. Search for a person on WeChat in China, you see two options: their personal WeChat, professional WeCom. Same ecosystem, separate contexts. You message friends on WeChat, coordinate work on WeCom. Both feel familiar, both interoperate, neither bleeds into the other. In 2022, WeCom has about 180 Million active users and are used by over 10 million businesses in China. [5] The boutique store owner shouldn’t manage customer orders where his daughter sends memes. The sales team shouldn’t lose client relationships when someone quits. The contractor shouldn’t coordinate labor in the same group planning his wife’s birthday. The solution exists. WeCom proves separating contexts without fragmenting networks is possible. But WhatsApp won’t implement it - not because of encryption, but because of infrastructure. WhatsApp’s value to Meta isn’t in reading your messages - they’re encrypted. It’s in the metadata around them: who you talk to, when, from where, and which businesses you engage with. Meta has added ads to WhatsApp’s Status tab, but the real value lies in metadata and business messaging, not large-scale ad placements. Linking WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram through Accounts Center lets Meta build a unified behavioral profile - without touching message content. [6] Splitting personal and professional WhatsApp use would shatter that identity layer. Meta wouldn’t lose access to messages - it never had them - but it would lose the metadata correlation powering cross-platform personalization. Keeping all communication in one place creates richer data, tighter business tracking, and a more valuable ecosystem. Which leaves the real question: if Meta won’t separate it, who will? WhatsApp isn’t going anywhere.Half a billion Indians won’t switch apps. Businesses won’t rebuild customer relationships. The network effects are too strong, the switching costs too high. Our goal should be to build optionality in the form of building ONDC-like infra for messaging. A protocol could make the platform used irrelevant. Instead of building one mega-app to rule all of e-commerce, ONDC built the rails underneath. A seller listing on one ONDC app can be discovered by buyers on completely different apps. Orders, payments, fulfillment - all work across platforms. No gatekeepers. Just open infrastructure. The same architecture can break WhatsApp’s monopoly. A messaging protocol doesn’t need 500 million users on day one. It needs 500,000 users who will pay because the protocol solves a problem WhatsApp won’t. For example we could start with construction contractors. They need labor coordination, site photos, payment tracking, and material orders - all over messaging. WhatsApp works, but barely. A purpose-built tool would save them hours daily. That’s the wedge. Once one vertical proves interoperability works, others follow - logistics, healthcare, education, government services. The network grows without forcing anyone to switch. The protocol layer should provide the essential stuff: End-to-end encryption standards Message delivery guarantees Identity verification Cross-app routing APIs Different apps build specialized experiences on top: One for Gen Z, one for the elderly, one for MSMEs and they should all be able to talk to each other. Same network. Different interfaces. Just like you can email someone on Gmail from Outlook. The protocol doesn’t care. It just routes messages. Email, the web, and Bluetooth already work on open protocols. WhatsApp solved India’s communication problem. Now India needs to solve WhatsApp’s incentive problem. That doesn’t mean banning WhatsApp or building a clone. It means creating optionality - a messaging layer where WhatsApp is one choice among many, not the only one that works. This isn’t about nationalism or rejecting foreign technology. It’s about infrastructure resilience. No nation should have its business communication layer entirely controlled by a single foreign corporation with different incentives. The question isn’t whether to replace WhatsApp. The question is: What does India need to build so that WhatsApp’s limitations stop being India’s limitations? That’s the conversation worth having.

WhatsApp’s New Marketing Message Limits Policy Change: Detailed Guide WhatsApp Business API Account Disabled? Here’s How to Unban it! WhatsApp changes its terms to bar general-purpose chatbots from its platform WeChat’s corporate communication tool reached 180 Million active users Adding WhatsApp to Meta Accounts Center. You can download the People’s Voice report on AI opportunities for Indian SMEs, created by People+AI in collaboration with 1990 Research Labs, below. Download Report This is hands-down one of the best infrastructure analysis pieces I've read on Indian tech. The cosmetic store owner's WhatsApp-as-inventory-system story perfectly captures how consumer apps get hacked into business tools when proper B2B infrastructure doesn't exist. What really stands out is your framing of the incentive mismatch: Meta optimizes for trillion-dollar ad opportunities while Indian MSMEs need hundred-million-dollar productivity solutions. That gap explains everything - the API restrictions, the pricing volatility, the feature stagnation. The WeChat/WeCom comparison is especially powerful because it shows the solution exists and works at scale. The separation of personal and professional contexts isn't a technical challenge, it's a business model choice. Meta won't build it because unified identity metadata across contexts is more valuable than serving SME needs. Your ONDC-for-messaging proposal is the right architectural direction. Interoperability solves the 'network effects as moat' problem without requiring mass migration. Start with one vertical (construction contractors is a great wedge), prove the protocol works, let ecosystem diversity emerge. One addition I'd suggest: the protocol layer should include reputation/trust primitives from day one. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is great for privacy but terrible for platform-level spam control. A federated messaging protocol needs portable reputation that follows business identities across apps - otherwise every new entrant rebuilds spam filters from scratch and user experience suffers. The question isn't whether this gets built, but who builds it and whether it stays open. Government-backed infrastructure has different risks than VC-backed platforms. Both can succumb to capture. The governance model matters as much as the tehcnical architecture. Would love to see a follow-up on that. Recently we started building some small solutions on Whatsapp through BSP. Also use it as a primary comm channel. It’s abundantly clear the limitations of WhatsApp while even building simple stuff. And the cost of messaging has increased to 0.80 in India. With delivery rates reducing businesses will need to look for another solution like RCS. This almost mimics the path brand Facebook pages took. Organic reach used to be 100% and now it’s barely there No posts Ready for more?

Agent Vincent Finnegan is offering a high-profile residential site in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock for sale by tender at a guide price of €6 million. Located on Newtownpark Avenue and just 50m from the N11 quality bus corridor, the subject property, which extends to 0.65 hectares (1.6 acres), comprises two houses – Selandia and the Paddock – and an afterschool centre known as the Willow House Afterschool. The subject site is zoned Objective A under the terms of the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council Development Plan 2022-2028. This objective supports residential development and residential amenities. A comprehensive planning appraisal of the site has been prepared by Hughes Planning and Development Consultants, and this provides specific advice on the prospect of securing planning permission for residential development, with an emphasis on apartment development. The report notes that a density of “up to 250 dwellings per hectare (162 units) could be considered where it [a planning proposal] meets the outlined development standards and safeguards the residential amenity of neighbouring properties”. It adds that “precedents in the area suggest a density closer to 165 dwellings per hectare (107 units) may be more in keeping with the established context”. The report further notes that the development plan “expresses a preference for retrofit and reuse [of existing properties] in the first instance”. It adds, however, that “there is a planning gain associated with increasing residential density on this site, and this would form a key part of the justification for demolition” notwithstanding the council’s focus on climate action. Any proposal for demolition would need to be robustly justified from an engineering, energy and planning perspective, the report concludes. The subject site is for sale by tender with the final date for receipt of tenders set for Friday, January 30th, 2026.

The rupee gained 2 paise to close at 88.58 against the US dollar amid strong equity markets and lower crude prices. CareEdge Ratings expects the passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes to grow by around 4% in FY26, driven by GST rationalization, easing inflation, and supportive fiscal measures in the Union Budget 2025–26. The GST cut on small cars (28% to 18%) is likely to revive entry-level demand, which has been under pressure for the last few years while removal of Cess on SUVs will further boost demand. SUVs are expected to continue dominating the market, growing by 8–10% and outpacing overall industry growth. Meanwhile, EV penetration is likely to remain modest at 3–4% while Hybrid volumes could grow by 34-38% in FY26, reaching ~1.07–1.10 lakh units, up from ~80,406 units (registered) in FY25. Madhusudhan Goswami, Assistant Director, CareEdge Ratings said, “GST rate cut coinciding with robust consumer sentiment in the festive season led to PV registrations reaching an all-time monthly high in October 2025. GST rate cut led to improved affordability, especially for the first-time PV owner. Also, robust growth in retail sales was observed across rural and urban markets. Going forward, with the end of festival season, PV sales is expected to normalize, however, growth momentum is expected to sustain due to upcoming harvest season boosting rural demand along-with seasonal demand from weddings.” The PV industry recorded healthy growth of 7.4% in FY24, which moderated to 3.7% in FY25, in line with CareEdge Ratings’ expectations. This slowdown was primarily due to the levelling off of pent-up demand, higher vehicle prices, and the high base effect of previous years. Despite these challenges, new model launches and strong SUV demand sustained overall momentum. Utility vehicle (UV) volumes grew 21.8% in FY24 and 14.0% in FY25, supported by a robust order book and rising preference for SUVs. In contrast, passenger car volumes declined 8.5% in FY24 and 11.5% in FY25, reflecting subdued entry-level demand and a structural shift toward SUVs. In a move that underscores the rising expectations for security and compliance across Web3, Polygon has officially listed Cyberscope, a subsidiary of TAC InfoSec Limited (NSE: TAC), as the first Smart Contract Audit company in the Polygon Ecosystem. The listing appears under the “Tools” category — placing Cyberscope alongside the foundational infrastructure powering thousands of decentralized applications on one of the world’s most scalable blockchain networks. For TAC InfoSec Limited, this marks another decisive step in its global Web3 expansion strategy — one that industry analysts say could materially influence the company’s audit volumes, revenue mix, and market leadership as blockchain security becomes a top-line concern for developers and investors. People familiar with the matter estimate that the Polygon integration could drive 400–500 new project engagements annually, of which 320–350 are expected to convert into full smart contract audits, supplemented by 60–80 KYC verifications. The demand pipeline is tied to the rapid growth of Polygon’s ecosystem and the increasing pressure on emerging Web3 teams to meet institutional-grade compliance norms. 360 ONE Asset has announced the appointment of Pritam Doshi as Chief Investment Officer and Head - Renewable Energy.

Fund is available under Canara HSBC Life Insurance Wealth Edge & Canara HSBC Life Insurance SecureInvest Fund will be open for subscription from November 18 to November 24, 2025, at a NAV of ₹10 per unit. Canara HSBC Life Insurance Company Limited (“Canara HSBC Life Insurance”) today announced the launch of the NextGen Consumption Fund, a first-of-its-kind fund in the life insurance industry designed to provide customers with a unique opportunity to participate in India’s evolving consumption growth story, driven primarily by millennials & GenZ. As India gets closer to its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy and is on track to emerge as a $30 trillion (~₹2,640 lakh crore) economy by 2047, a significant part of this growth is being driven by a young and aspirational population. With India’s median age at 28.8, this generation has rising disposable income. This coupled with rapid urbanization, supportive government initiatives such as GST 2.0 and enhanced access to financial tools have enabled growth momentum in consumption. Nifty India New Age Consumption Index proves this trend with a strong five-year CAGR of 26.6%, outperforming broader indices such as Nifty 500 TRI (21.1%) and Nifty 50 TRI (18.6%) as of 31st October 2025. The NextGen Consumption Fund is an actively managed fund with Nifty India New Age Consumption Index as its benchmark. The NextGen Consumption Fund uniquely invests in companies that reflect rising consumption driven by the younger generation. This fund targets the growth potential of the Indian economy by focusing on companies that cater to the changing lifestyles and demands of the next generation.

Extreme fear, record ETF outflows, and a brief slip of the futures curve into backwardation underscored the depth of the move. Yet several structural indicators are turning supportive, liquidation clusters are building in the $85K–$90K region, and short-term holder capitulation is nearing exhaustion. Together, they point toward a maturing correction phase rather than the start of a deeper bear cycle. Bitcoin’s asymmetric reaction to equity weakness also mirrors patterns historically seen around macro lows. Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin’s slide. Ethereum’s 20% monthly decline has driven its Mayer Multiple below 1, a zone that has repeatedly marked long-term accumulation ranges. Liquidity pockets near $2,900–$2,760 may still induce short-term volatility before a base settles. Solana and XRP recovered modestly on the week, but exchange reserves and open interest trends show broad deleveraging across majors rather than exit-driven selling. With sentiment compressed and risk premiums elevated, the market is operating inside a technical pocket that has often preceded reflexive rebounds once macro drivers stabilise. Our advice: The market is showing signs that the worst of the selling may be behind us, but it is still early to call a turn. Liquidations around $85K to $90K and cooling capitulation tell us sellers are tiring, yet we need spot strength to confirm it. Stay light, avoid leverage, and let the market show stability before adding risk.

Thanks & Regards, Kunal Sodhani (Beast) (Personal view) Indian government bonds are expected to trade in a tight range early on Wednesday, with sentiment likely to remain subdued as buying from a key investor category, which includes the central bank, slumped in the previous session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note may drift between 6.50% and 6.55%, a trader at a primary dealership said, after ending at 6.5258% on Tuesday. Purchases from the “others” category, which includes the Reserve Bank of India, plummeted to about 2 billion rupees ($22.58 million), compared with a daily average of 50 billion rupees in the week ended November 7 when the central bank returned to secondary market purchases of bonds after a gap of six months, CCIL data showed. The RBI’s buying earlier this month had raised hopes that the demand–supply balance in the market would improve. The recent drop in volumes has now reinforced traders’ conviction that the purchases were largely to replace maturing holdings, rather than to send a signal for lower yields. “No buying from the others category is negative for bonds, but any further news on India’s inclusion in global indices will support the market,” a trader at a private bank said. The 10-year yield eased about 2 basis points on Tuesday, after local media reports suggested India’s chances of inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index had improved, traders said. Focus is also on the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes due after market hours on Wednesday, for cues on the U.S. rate-easing trajectory. India's equity benchmarks are set to open flat amid subdued global sentiment and investor caution ahead of key economic data.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: T-Mobile: AST SpaceMobile Satellites Pose Potential Risk to Cellular Networks

SpaceX's partner, T-Mobile, is pressing US regulators to scrutinize AST SpaceMobile, arguing that the company’s satellites risk causing harmful interference to terrestrial cell networks. On Tuesday, T-Mobile sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, which is reviewing AST SpaceMobile’s application to operate a satellite internet service for phones. It urges the FCC to "take no action" on AST's application "unless and until sufficient information is provided” about the radio interference concerns. “AST has failed to demonstrate that its proposed SCS [Supplemental Coverage from Space] operations will satisfy the Commission’s stated goal to minimize the risk of interference from SCS services to existing terrestrial networks,” the carrier says. T-Mobile adds that AST should be required to disclose its maps detailing where the satellite signals will reach in the US, including over traditional cellular sites. “Accordingly, AST must provide maps that show the overlay of its satellite beams on all geographic market areas, for all relevant elevation angles, including license areas to which it will have access to terrestrial spectrum, and how its satellites will be capable of confining SCS service to those licensed areas,” T-Mobile claims. It also alleges that AST has been using metrics to underestimate the potential radio interference to user equipment. Texas-based AST SpaceMobile didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company’s upcoming constellation is poised to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which launched through T-Mobile in July. AST has partnered with AT&T and Verizon to deliver its own satellite-to-phone service, starting as soon as next year. To do so, the company is preparing to launch dozens of exceptionally large "BlueBird" satellites, with the first prototypes scheduled to fly in the coming weeks. But another crucial step is receiving FCC approval to officially operate the satellite-to-phone service in the US. The radio interference concerns from T-Mobile are a bit ironic, considering its partner SpaceX has faced and fought back against its own interference claims from other companies. Such disputes are nothing new at the FCC, where satellite operators routinely lobby for spectrum access and regulatory approvals. SpaceX previously challenged AST’s plans through earlier FCC filings. However, AST has fired back, calling out SpaceX as anticompetitive and criticizing its approach to satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn’t capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta did not immediately respond to a message for comment. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 3:05 PM EST / AP Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission "continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions," Boasberg wrote in his ruling. "Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so." Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved "current or imminent legal violation." The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and "neutralize perceived competitive threats," just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. Meta said Tuesday's decision "recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition." "Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America," the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it "holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival." Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, "that no man can ever step into the same river twice," Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. "The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down," he wrote. Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win "is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok." "But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health," she added. "Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run." Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller "acqui-hires" — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. © 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: Meta prevails in existential challenge as court rules it’s not a monopoly

A US judge ruled that the social media landscape had ‘changed markedly’ since the lawsuit was brought five years ago. By AP Share Save Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. United States District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralise a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time did not capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralise perceived competitive threats”, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — did not even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival”. Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, that “No man ever steps into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media, as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no advertisements and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1bn cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750m after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision runs in sharp contrast to two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing regulatory blows to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now.

While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote the emails early in the acquisition process and that the notes did not fully capture the scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. Prosecutors, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if they proved “current or imminent legal violation.” The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. Meta said Tuesday’s decision “recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.” “Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,” said Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer, in a statement. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok.

Title: Dow plunges 500 points on fears of AI bubble, waning hope for Fed rate cut

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, Tuesday as fears over an AI bubble shook the market and traders fretted that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve aren’t a sure thing. It was fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index and the S&P 500, which dipped 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 1.2% as investors panicked over whether AI firms have been overvalued – extending a rocky tech rout into its third week. Shares in Nvidia fell nearly 3%. The chipmaker is reporting its third-quarter results on Wednesday, toward the end of an especially upbeat earnings season. But “Magnificent 7” tech stocks have dropped amid fears that AI enthusiasm is reminiscent of the “dot-com bubble” of the 1990s and early 2000s. Amazon, Microsoft and Meta also fell. “All technology revolutions create bubble-like stock price performance – but this bubble is still inflating at a healthy pace with no signs of popping anytime soon,” James Denmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, said in a note Tuesday. “Valuations, while expensive, still trade at discounts to earnings growth rates and overall AI market sentiment is mildly bullish and not euphoric.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting plunged to just over 50% – down from more than 90% this time last month, according to CME FedWatch, which tracks Fed Funds futures prices. Investors are looking ahead to the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday. The September jobs report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, is due out Thursday. Despite the upcoming data releases, which are key to the Fed’s decision-making process, several officials have continued to advocate for a slower rate-cutting pace. That has spooked investors who are eager for low interest rates – sending gold futures down 0.3% to $4,062 for its fourth straight day of declines. Meanwhile, Anthropic on Tuesday announced plans to buy $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft as part of a new strategic deal. Microsoft will invest $5 billion into Anthropic, and Nvidia will give $10 billion to the startup as part of the deal. While massive AI partnerships would usually send stocks soaring, both Microsoft and Nvidia saw big losses. Anthropic is a private company. Further adding to fears of an AI bubble, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told BBC on Tuesday that there is some “irrationality” in the current AI boom. In the case of an AI bubble bursting, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said. Bitcoin dropped briefly below $90,000 on Tuesday. Many tech investors with substantial AI holdings also own cryptocurrency. By about 12:52 p.m., the cryptocurrency jumped 1.3% to $93,249.46. Shares in Home Depot plummeted 6% after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and missed earnings estimates as inflation-battered consumers hold off on renovations. While a November pullback is unusual, it could set up the stock market for a strong December and end to the year, Denmert said in his note. In the previous trading session, the 30-stock Dow fell more than 550 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped about 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq appears on track to break its seven-month streak of gains. Advertisement

The launch on HASTE – Rocket Lab’s commercial launch vehicle for regular and reliable hypersonic test flights – took place from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 on Wallops Island, Virginia, at 13:00 UTC/08:00 a.m. ET on November 18, 2025. Led by MDA, the mission deployed a government-provided primary payload developed by the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and multiple secondary payloads by federal and industry partners, which tested key technologies for missile defense applications. The mission was contracted to Rocket Lab through the DIU’s Hypersonic and High-Cadence Airborne Testing Capabilities (HyCAT) program, an initiative supporting test and evaluation of new and emerging hypersonic technologies through low cost, responsive and long endurance flight testing. The mission launched within 14 months of contract signing, demonstrating streamlined operational benefits for government customers through Rocket Lab’s commercial speed, innovation, and efficiency. The mission also exemplified the cost and schedule savings that commercial liquid launch vehicles can bring to the MDA test community for developmental testing, non-traditional targets testing, and risk-reduction payload testing activities. Rocket Lab’s Vice President Global Launch Services, Brian Rogers, says: “HASTE is an important platform for accelerating hypersonic technology readiness for the nation, and we’re proud to be delivering this mission for DIU and MDA.” LtCol Nicholas Estep, Director of DIU’s Emerging Technology Portfolio, says: “Accessing the commercial and non-traditional ecosystem is a key enabler to accelerating progress in the hypersonics community of interest, particularly for closing mission timelines and driving towards mass and affordability. Working with MDA to demonstrate commercially-focused sub-orbital launch services is a great example of that axiom.” The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth launch of its HASTE rocket since the launch vehicle’s debut in 2023. A suborbital variant of Electron - the world’s most frequently launched small orbital rocket - HASTE includes much of the same innovative technology as Electron, including carbon fiber composite structures and 3D printed rocket engines, but has a modified upper Kick Stage tailored for hypersonic technology tests and a larger payload capacity. HASTE can deploy technologies at speeds of more than 7.5km per second to test air-breathing, glide, and ballistic payloads, as well as technologies to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from space. Combined, the HASTE and Electron launch vehicles have deployed 200+ payloads for government and commercial customers to date.

Title: Layoff notices flared in October across much of U.S., Fed report shows

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 12:16 PM EST / CBS News Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs. It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Layoff notices across the 21 states tracked by the Cleveland Fed reached a peak of more than 550,000 in March 2020. Major companies including Target, Amazon and UPS have announced rounds of job cuts in recent weeks, with some economists noting that the labor market appears to be weakening. The record-long government shutdown has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions. Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while ADP data released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1. Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come. Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a Monday email that they expect layoffs to pick up next year amid wider AI adoption, while noting that the technology has had a "net positive impact" on the labor market so far this year. The delayed September employment report, which will be released Thursday, will provide another barometer on the health of the U.S. labor market. Economists polled by financial data provider FactSet predict payroll gains of 50,000. Edited by Aimee Picchi © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their slide Tuesday afternoon, amid worries about an AI bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were down about 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%. Home Depot (HD) shares fell 4% after the home-improvement retailer reported disappointing third-quarter earnings and cut its full-year profit outlook. Cloudflare (NET) shares declined 3% after the web security company was affected by an outage that hit several prominent customers, including social media site X and ChatGPT. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday, were down 3%. Microsoft (MSFT) shares were also about 3% lower after the two Magnificent 7 members announced partnerships with Claude AI developer Anthropic. Nvidia and Microsoft said they will invest up to $10 billion and up to $5 billion, respectively, in Anthropic as part of the deals. Medtronic (MDT) shares rose 4% after the maker of medical devices reported better-than-expected fiscal 2026 second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook. Shares of crypto-treasury firm Strategy (MSTR), which entered Tuesday down 27% this month as the price of Bitcoin has tumbled, rebounded roughly 6% along with the price of the largest cryptocurrency. Merck (MRK) stock advanced 4% after the pharmaceutical firm announced positive results from a Phase 2 trial of a heart drug. Oil and gold futures slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower. The U.S. dollar was little changed against the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

Title: Berkshire Hathaway's Latest Stock Moves Unveiled: What Investors Need To Know

As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the company is making moves few would expect from the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett spent decades telling investors he doesn't understand technology stocks well enough to bet big on them. Yet Berkshire Hathaway's latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the company has made a new $4.9 billion wager on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), while offloading shares in long-held favorites like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC). Are these signals that the company is shifting its investment philosophy? The surprise stake in Google’s parent company, worth about $4.9 billion, marks one of the conglomerate’s biggest moves in recent years—one that seems to challenge Buffett’s long-standing caution toward Silicon Valley. With Buffett planning to “go quiet—sort of,” as he put it last week, after his final months as CEO, the moves could mark a new era for one of the world’s most closely watched portfolios. The company’s new 17.8 million-share position in Alphabet signals a potential change in how Berkshire approaches technology stocks. The purchase stands out as Berkshire’s largest new investment of the quarter, after Buffett grew the company's massive cash pile to $382 billion while others poured their money into tech stocks this year. At the 2019 Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger said they had "screwed up" not buying Alphabet earlier, despite watching Google advertising spark massive sales across their own businesses. At the time, shares traded around $59, increasing nearly fivefold in price since. This isn't a typical Buffett buy. The Oracle of Omaha has consistently shied away from tech stocks he says he doesn't fully understand, making an exception only for Apple—which he famously reframed as a consumer products company instead. The timing could suggest Abel's growing influence as he prepares to officially take over as CEO in the New Year. Still, Berkshire's Alphabet shares are worth far less than its stakes in Coca-Cola (KO, 9.9%) and Chevron Corp. (CVX, 7.1%), continuing a portfolio historically dominated by consumer staples and energy. The cut in Apple shares is part of a longer story between the companies. Berkshire slashed its shares by almost 15% last quarter, which means it's sold about 74% of its stake in AAPL in the last two years alone. That seems to mark a systematic unwinding of what was once one of Buffett's highest-conviction bets. The steady sell-off of Bank of America stock suggests Buffett—or his team—sees limited upside in traditional banking at 2025 stock values, possibly concerned about economic headwinds or simply rebalancing away from financial services. Together, those moves continue a broader pattern of profit-taking on legendary legacy holdings. Even so, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest single investment—about 21% of its total portfolio. Meanwhile, Berkshire added $1.2 billion to its Chubb insurance stake, indicating that it remains interested in financial services when the stock price is right. Berkshire's portfolio reshuffling could offer three crucial lessons for everyday investors:

That seems to mark a systematic unwinding of what was once one of Buffett's highest-conviction bets. The steady sell-off of Bank of America stock suggests Buffett—or his team—sees limited upside in traditional banking at 2025 stock values, possibly concerned about economic headwinds or simply rebalancing away from financial services. Together, those moves continue a broader pattern of profit-taking on legendary legacy holdings. Even so, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest single investment—about 21% of its total portfolio. Meanwhile, Berkshire added $1.2 billion to its Chubb insurance stake, indicating that it remains interested in financial services when the stock price is right. Berkshire's portfolio reshuffling could offer three crucial lessons for everyday investors:

Title: Google Says New Gemini 3 AI Model Will Better Understand Your Requests

Gemini 3 is available to all users in the Gemini app, along with powering AI Mode in Google Search. Google Gemini 3 Gemini 3, the latest AI model from Google, is the company's most intelligent model to date, with more advanced multimodal and vibe coding capabilities, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. It's available now. Google says Gemini 3 is "built to grasp depth and nuance" and is better at understanding the intent behind a user's request. The company also touted Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities, such as its ability to turn a long video lecture into interactive flash cards or to analyze a person's pickleball match and find areas for improvement. Gemini 3 isn't limited to the app. It'll also be available in AI Mode in Search and, for Pro and Ultra subscribers, in AI Overviews. In AI Overviews, Gemini 3 can generate interactive elements. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and Koray Kavukcuoglu said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Pro is less sycophantic, a problem that's been plaguing AIs and leading to AI psychosis in some. It's also more secure against prompt injection attacks, in which bad actors try to make an AI ignore its original instructions and perform unintended actions. The company also unveiled Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. Google says Antigravity is like having an active partner while making tools or working on projects, autonomously planning and executing complex software tasks while validating its own code. It works in tandem with Gemini 2.5's Computer Use model for browser control and works with nano banana, Gemini 2.5's image model. Gemini 3's new, more powerful, agentic capabilities will only be available to $250/month Google AI Ultra subscribers at first. This will allow the Gemini Agent to do multi-step workflows, like planning a travel itinerary. Read more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways You Can Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts Google's release of Gemini 3 comes as an AI war is heating up between it, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. Google's consistently been leading AI leaderboards, although other AI models haven't been far behind, sometimes trading spots at the top. With the release of Gemini 3, Google seems to be trying to solve for some of AI's more annoying problems, like hallucinations or sycophancy. It's also trying to prove that AIs can be truly agentic, being able to accomplish tasks on the user's behalf. Other agentic models have proven to be problematic in real-world usage and run into various security concerns, especially in web browsers. The latest AI release from Google also comes at a time when there are fears of an AI bubble forming in the stock market. AI companies, including Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft, account for 30% of the S&P 500. Google currently has a valuation of $3.4 trillion. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the trillion-dollar AI investment boom has "elements of irrationality" and that a burst would affect every AI company, he said in an interview with the BBC. Still, if Google is to keep its stock price moving upward, it needs to demonstrate that its AI models beat the competition. AI exists in Google Search currently in two ways: via AI Overviews and through AI Mode. AI Overviews is the window that appears under your search query, where a smaller AI model attempts to quickly answer your questions. AI Overviews is a separate tab in Search, alongside Images, Shopping, News and Videos that runs a more advanced model allowing users to converse with it. It's like using Gemini, but without having to go to the main Gemini website. As of now, Gemini 3 is in AI Mode, but only for those who pay for a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription. Gemini 3 enhancements are also available in AI Overviews, but only for subscribers. Gemini 3 Pro is available in AI Mode for subscribers as well. In AI Mode, Google is touting Gemini's ability to take existing information and create bespoke UI elements. This magazine-style view will incorporate interactable widgets, images and videos. For example, if researching mortgages, Gemini can create a custom calculator to help you compare terms and savings options. Google Search uses a "fan-out" technique to pull information from across the web. With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, Google says Search can uncover more information on the web and intelligently understand your intent.

Title: Will the price be right? What shoppers can expect for the holiday season
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/18/shoppers-prices-holiday-season/
Time Published: 2025-11-18T15:00:20Z

By Candice Williams and Myesha Johnson, The Detroit News FERNDALE, Michigan — Concerned about this year’s holiday season, the owners of Modern Natural Baby and Kids planned ahead. In addition to mailing out 10,000 Christmas catalogs for the first time, the store opened a warehouse to house more inventory, including stuffed animals and books. “We bought a lot of this stuff in March and April when we were worried about tariffs and not having stuff available for Christmas,” said Emily Murray, who co-owns the Ferndale store with her husband, John. “We’ve been buying this stuff for a long time this year, and we have a warehouse that we’ve never had before, so primarily that was a result of tariffs.” Retailers are preparing for a holiday season clouded by tariffs, inflation and economic uncertainty. Consumers will see higher prices, fewer deep discounts and tighter inventory in some categories. As a result, they are expected to be more selective with their purchases, trading down on everyday items like groceries to afford higher-priced gifts. Deloitte projects that overall holiday spending will decline about 10% this year as consumers spend less due to economic concerns, while Adobe Analytics expects online holiday sales to rise about 5%, pointing to the strength of e-commerce even among increasingly budget-conscious households. Despite these mixed forecasts, retailers remain optimistic that holiday sales will improve over slower traffic earlier this year. “We’ve had such a long season of decline,” said Vic Veda, vice president of communications for the Michigan Retailers Association. “We’re continually hoping that we’re going to turn that corner. Seeing our retail index as high as it is for the outlook at the end of the year really tells us that retailers are very much looking forward to this holiday shopping season and hoping that the holidays will get folks back a little more compared to what they were this summer.” According to the Michigan Retailers Association, about 63% of retailers surveyed expect sales to increase through the end of the year, one of the highest outlooks in recent months. Of those surveyed, 31% said they anticipate their sales will decline, while 6% expect no change. Veda said robust Halloween spending could point to a stronger-than-expected holiday season; the National Retail Federation projected sales would total a record $13.1 billion. She said that while inventory levels are generally stable, smaller stores face greater uncertainty due to tariffs and limited funds to buy ahead. Overall, prices of goods are expected to keep increasing due to the tariffs and inflation, said Juan Mundel, associate professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University. “Prices are expected to be higher this season, and while retailers are going to introduce discounts … consumers should not expect the same prices as last year,” he said. Then there’s the issue of leaner supply. Stanley Lim, assistant professor of supply chain management at Michigan State, advises shoppers to buy early if they see something they want. This year’s retail challenges stem mostly from economic pressures, particularly rising logistics costs and tariffs. “The supply chain isn’t broken … but it’s definitely running a lot leaner and more compact than before,” he said. “And so retailers will not feel the tinge of not having the stock or missing the containers, but (instead) maybe longer replenishment cycles and tighter margins. So they may be more selective in terms of what items they want to make available on the shelf this holiday season.” Lim said many retailers are launching promotions at the beginning of November to get ahead of Black Friday, and even offering price guarantees to assure customers that early purchases will match any later markdowns. Some retailers have already announced Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. For example, Walmart offered a sneak peek last week of its first Black Friday Deals event that begins Nov. 14 online and in-store. The retailer is promoting what it calls its biggest lineup of deals, including “thousands of deals under $20,” John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. Earlier this month, Meijer announced an early promotion of double mPerks savings on toys through Nov. 4, as well as the return of its Santa Bucks during select weeks in November and December. The retailer said it has hundreds of toys and gifts priced under $10, $20 and $30. Mundel said Black Friday sales are ideal for consumers shopping for items like TVs and sportswear, while Cyber Monday will offer the best overall deals of the season. “After Cyber Monday, prices will continue to increase, leading to the holiday season,” he said. Consumers will likely trade down on everyday goods like groceries and cosmetics to free up money for higher-priced gifts such as electronics and video games. According to Deloitte, consumers are expected to spend an average of $1,595 this holiday season, down 10% from $1,778 in 2024. A majority of shoppers, 70%, plan to shop during the Thanksgiving week, up slightly from 68% in 2024. Traffic is expected to peak between late November and early December, including shopping events on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday. One recent weekend at Modern Natural Baby and Kids, shoppers including Marisa Vinsky, 31, and Jon Young, 34, took advantage of the store’s free gift wrapping service. The Lansing, Michigan, couple bought a pop-up book that says “Hello” in seven languages as well as a sensory, weighted stuffed octopus for a 10-month-old baby girl. Vinsky said she’d be shopping again online and at big-box stores like Costco and Home Depot around Black Friday in search of the best deals for an electric meat smoker for Young. “The way the economy is right now … I typically shop online,” she said. “I don’t really go to stores, and that’s how I find things. One year, I got him a KitchenAid, and that was really easy to find online. I can imagine that with the economy and how much everything is being raised with tariffs, I can imagine the prices are going to be higher than average.” At Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan, last week, holiday decorations were already on display amid preparations for Santa’s visit this week. General Manager Scott Lofton said he expects the mall to be busy during the holiday shopping season, especially on Black Friday. Sisters Constance Laderoot and Chibwe Powell, both in their 40s, brought their mother to the mall to walk around. They weren’t holiday shopping just yet — instead, they picked up some clothing for themselves. Laderoot said she thinks Black Friday shopping habits have changed, with fewer people lining up before dawn for deals. She said she’d like to see retailers offer more in-person deals and increase the number of items available at discount prices. “I think most of us have scaled back a little, right?” she said. “So most people are doing online shopping, and then there’s some in-person shopping.” Powell said she plans to start holiday shopping right after Thanksgiving, adding that because she also has some birthday gifts to buy: “I start shopping early.” She’s looking forward to Macy’s perfume deals during the holidays. “Macy’s perfume situation, when it happens, it’s impressive,” she said. Black Friday is still relevant, Powell said. “It’s just been a tradition. You don’t want to always go away from the tradition. I remember being nine months pregnant and shopping.” Elle Dare, owner of Genuine Toys in Plymouth, Michigan, said preparing for this year’s holiday season has been especially challenging because tariffs have disrupted toy production and driven up prices. “The toys that are produced for Christmas are made in the summer, and they stopped production because of tariffs,” she said. “So it’s spotty getting things in. Some things we know aren’t going to come in until January. One company, we get a box every other day of just one item. It’s hard.” Dare said she hopes to have the store fully stocked by mid-November, ahead of Black Friday and Small Business Saturday. Vendors can’t guarantee delivery dates since overseas shipments take about eight weeks and face customs and tariff delays once they reach U.S. ports. “I would tell people, if you see it now, get it,” she said. “If it does sell out, there’s no way we’re ever going to get another shipment before the holidays.” Prices have increased due to tariffs. For example, an item that used to sell for $50 is now going to be $65. “At $50, it was a good deal, but will our customers be willing to pay $65 for it?” she said. “This is such an odd situation.” MSU’s Lim said price increases due to tariffs are based on factors such as the product category and country of origin. “Some (retailers) may be willing to absorb the cost, the additional cost to gain demand and loyalty, but others may not have sufficient margins to absorb, and so they will have to then pass down to the customers,” he said. Some shoppers have already finished their holiday buying, Dare said, anticipating further price increases, while others are waiting to see what happens. She said some families may focus on one main gift for their children and supplement with a few less-expensive gifts. “Even if the tariffs ended today, the tariffs have still been paid on the toys that are in the warehouses, so that cost still has to be passed on,” she said. “They wouldn’t immediately come down.” Among the most popular products are Calico Critters and Smiskis, small collectible figurines sold at a handful of stores in Michigan. Genuine Toys limits purchases to two per customer due to high demand, Dare said. Modern Natural Baby and Kids has already seen an influx of customers for the holiday season, said John Murray. The store carries brands including Jellycat and Sam & Julia. “It’s insane already,” he said. “People have already started shopping. That’s the crazy part about it. Everybody’s kind of afraid that there’s not going to be inventory. … Everybody’s worried not that there’s not going to be toys, but will the best toys be available.” The store employs 10 people, adding three staff members for the holiday season. “It’s going to help us out for the holiday season having the extra help,” said Emily Murray. Larger retailers are also hiring seasonal workers to handle an increase in shoppers. For example, Target is offering additional hours to current employees and hiring seasonal team members across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 supply chain facilities. Amazon said it is creating 250,000 seasonal positions nationwide, including 6,500 jobs in Michigan. At Genuine Toys, Dare said she’s adding two workers to a staff of five. Catching Fireflies plans to add three to five part-time workers at each of its locations in Berkley, Rochester and Ann Arborm, Michigan, to meet expected holiday demand. The store sells whimsical gifts, including novelty socks, kitchen gadgets and specialty cookbooks. “Twenty percent of our sales happen in the month of December alone,” said owner April McCrumb. “Hanukkah and Christmas definitely play a huge part in our retail success. Once the holidays kick in, that’s when a lot of profit from being in the gift business comes.” ©2025 www.detroitnews.com. Visit at detroitnews.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: A Decade In The Making, HaptX Team Debuts Full Body VR Haptics

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. In 2017 I visited a small VR startup called AxonVR in Seattle. Founder Jake Rubin showed me concept art for a full body suspension system. A user hung in mid air inside a frame, held in place by a network of supports that allowed the arms and legs to move freely. The idea was simple to state and difficult to build. They wanted to create total immersion by capturing every motion and returning physical feedback across the user’s entire body. It looked like something from a futurist exhibit. It also captured the ambition of a team that believed VR needed more than visuals and audio to be useful. The suspension system never shipped. AxonVR changed its name to HaptX and shifted its focus to haptic gloves powered by microfluidics. The team found immediate demand for precise tactile feedback in robotics, training, and design. Gloves became the company’s core product. Enterprise customers used them to train medical staff, evaluate automotive prototypes, and operate remote manipulators. Defense agencies incorporated them into medic training modules. Robotics groups relied on them for fine motor teleoperation. That focus eventually reshaped the company. HaptX began working closely with a manufacturing group called Advanced Input Systems. The partnership deepened over the years and expanded again in 2024. The gloves became a supported product line inside the broader organization. The combined entity adopted the name 1HMX. Rubin and members of his team became part of the larger company. The resources available to them changed. The manufacturing footprint now spans several continents. The gloves matured into a stable commercial product with a large global customer base. Last week Rubin reached out again. The note contained a link to a new system called Nexus NX1. It launches next week under the 1HMX brand. Rubin told me it is the closest thing the company has ever built to the suspended full body concept they sketched ten years ago. The visual form is different. The purpose is the same. The Nexus NX1 joins three mature products in one turnkey system. The HaptX Gloves G1 provide detailed tactile and force feedback. The Virtuix Omni One provides a platform that enables a user to walk in any direction while remaining stationary in physical space. Freeaim robotic shoes add natural stride and foot movement. The system tracks seventy two degrees of freedom across the hands and body. It captures posture, limb rotation, foot placement, center of mass, and soft tissue movement. It returns real time tactile information from hundreds of points on the fingers and palms. The result is a body scale interface that can control both virtual characters and physical robots. Users can walk, reach, grasp, and lift with realistic feedback. Developers can collect data describing how skilled workers move through complex tasks. Robotics teams can link the system to a humanoid robot and observe how a trained operator performs precise motions. Training groups can use it to rehearse procedures inside simulated environments. The introduction video shows the intended use. A person walks inside the Omni platform. The shoes move with the surface. Every gesture and shift in balance flows through the system. A humanoid robot mirrors the movements. The user receives touch and pressure information through the gloves. It is not a suspended rig. It is grounded. The experience is shaped by the strengths of the components. I asked Rubin how closely Nexus NX1 matches the vision he described in 2017. He said it aligns with the goal the team set when they were still called AxonVR. Full body input, full body output, and real physical response. The form changed. The intention remained. Preorders for Nexus NX1 open November 18 with shipments expected in second quarter 2026. It marks a return to the idea that started the company. AxonVR imagined a full body system before the industry had a way to build it. The version arriving now comes from a far larger organization with the scale to produce it.

November 18, 2025 08:44 ET | Source: Defiance ETFs Defiance ETFs MIAMI, Nov. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs proudly announces the launch of the Defiance Daily Target 2X Short RKLB ETF (Ticker: RKLZ), expanding its family of single-stock leveraged ETFs designed for sophisticated traders seeking tactical exposure to high-growth innovation companies. RKLZ seeks to deliver -200% of the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB), offering investors an instrument to express short-term bearish views on a leading player in the space launch and aerospace manufacturing industry. Investment Objective The Fund seeks daily inverse investment results, before fees and expenses, of -2 times (-200%) the daily percentage change in the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB). The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective for a period other than a single trading day. Underlying Stock: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation is an end-to-end space company delivering reliable launch services, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. As one of the leading providers of small satellite launch services, Rocket Lab develops and operates its Electron and Neutron launch vehicles, as well as the Photon spacecraft platform. The company’s mission is to open access to space to improve life on Earth, supporting a wide range of applications across defense, research, and commercial communications sectors. An investment in RKLZ is not an investment in Rocket Lab Corporation The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged inverse (–2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund pursues daily leveraged inverse investment objectives, which means it is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage. The Fund magnifies the inverse performance of the Underlying Security and is designed strictly for short-term use. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund’s performance will be the result of compounded daily returns, which is very likely to differ from –200% of the return of RKLB over the same period. It is possible investors could lose their entire principal within a single trading day. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. Hard copies can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the Fund may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single issuer or sector may be subject to a higher degree of risk. There is no guarantee the Fund’s strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of their investment. RKLB Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s inverse investment strategy, the Fund enters into swap contracts and options contracts based on the share price of Rocket Lab Corporation (“RKLB”) common stock (the “Underlying Security”). This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted shares of the Underlying Security, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect -2X exposure to changes in the share price of the Underlying Security, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Underlying Security’s share price increases. If the share price of the Underlying Security increases, the Fund will likely lose value and may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: Indirect Investment in RKLB Risk. Rocket Lab Corporation is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates, and is not involved with this offering in any way. RKLB has no obligation to consider the Fund or its shareholders in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Fund shares. RKLB Good Performance Risk. The market value of Rocket Lab Corporation may increase if the company achieves or exceeds its business goals, expands its partnerships with government or commercial clients, or benefits from favorable policy, funding, or market sentiment toward the aerospace and satellite sectors. Innovations in propulsion and launch vehicle technology, successful missions, or heightened investor enthusiasm could further contribute to stock price appreciation, adversely impacting the Fund’s inverse exposure. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific factors may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than diversified investments. The Fund focuses on a single equity security and may fluctuate sharply compared to the broader market. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will result from each day’s returns compounded over time, likely differing from -200% of the Underlying Security’s performance before fees and expenses. Compounding effects are magnified during volatile markets and extended holding periods. Daily Correlation/Tracking Risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of inverse correlation to RKLB’s share performance. Market disruptions or high volatility may cause the Fund’s exposure to exceed or fall short of its target -200% objective. Leverage Risk. The Fund will seek -2X inverse exposure through financial instruments such as swaps and options, which can amplify both gains and losses. Leverage increases volatility, and losses may exceed the Underlying Security’s gains on any given day. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk that counterparties to its derivative positions may default, experience insolvency, or fail to perform obligations. The Fund may be unable to recover its investment or experience delays in recovery. Derivatives and Options Risk. The Fund’s investments in swaps and options involve heightened risks including market volatility, imperfect correlation with underlying securities, and liquidity or valuation challenges. Option contracts, in particular, are influenced by actual and anticipated volatility and can rapidly change in value. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, their value will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Rising rates typically cause declines in fixed income prices, particularly for longer-duration instruments. Other factors such as credit, extension, and prepayment risks may also negatively affect the Fund’s NAV. Rebalancing Risk. If the Fund cannot rebalance its portfolio or rebalances incorrectly, its exposure may deviate materially from its -2X investment objective, increasing risk and reducing performance accuracy. Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of assets in a single issuer or small number of issuers, resulting in greater potential loss. Liquidity Risk. Derivative positions or certain underlying securities may become illiquid during periods of market stress, impeding the Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. New Fund Risk. The Fund is newly organized and has a limited operating history, which may increase uncertainty in achieving its investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage commissions may apply.

Title: UK’s Pulse Films to end TV content production as parent company Vice Studios makes redundancies

Pulse Films was behind Gangs of London for Sky and AMC Gangs of London maker Pulse Films is to stop production of TV and film content after parent company Vice Studios Group made a number of layoffs in the UK. The celebrated scripted prodco, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has made shows such as Netflix factual hit The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann and Sky action series Atomic, will now make only branded content, music videos and commercials. According to reports by Deadline, Vice has made layoffs in Pulse’s London headquarters, with all future scripted projects – such as a fourth season of Sky/AMC gangster series Gangs of London – to now be taken over by Vice Studios in LA. Vice Studios Group co-president Jamie Hall last week was named the new scripted MD for BBC Studios Productions, with the former Pulse Films chief operating officer and president of scripted TV set to take up his new role in January 2026. Vice Studios is led by former Amazon and Paramount executive Amy Powell, who was named president in May. In August, Vice raised US$75m via a new credit facility led by Western Alliance Bank, with plans to use the funds to support content investment through Vice Studios. The company said the credit facility was part of a larger five-year, US$500m investment in developing and producing scripted and unscripted content for TV, streaming and digital. Pulse was impacted in 2022 by the departures of founders and CEOs Thomas Benski and Marisa Clifford, who stepped down after 16 years at the prodco. Their departure came six years after the pair, who founded Pulse Films in 2005, sold a controlling interest to Vice Media Group. Benski subsequently joined forces with French actor Omar Sy (Lupin) and Hollywood director Louis Leterrier to launch scripted outfit Carrousel Studios in 2024, as well as rolling out talent- and IP-led media group and venture capital firm Lumina late last year. In September, Lumina made a seven-figure investment in creator-first UK management group Arcade, which represents YouTube collective The Sidemen.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It was difficult in the beginning to answer the question I got from everyone: what’s it like living in America again? After all, I had been coming back to Wisconsin in the summer for years, and my move back happened in the summer; things mostly felt like more of the same. Then, the leaves started turning colors, the air became chillier, and, as daylight grew shorter I came to relish one decision in particular: living in the suburbs. There is much to be said for urban life, and I was certainly spoiled in that regard living in Taipei. It always seemed odd to answer the question “What is the best part about living in Taiwan?” with the word “Convenient”, but that’s the honest truth: everything you needed was within walking distance, the subway was extensive, clean, and reliable, and, once you understood that traffic was governed by the rule of rivers (the bigger you are the more right of way you have), driving really wasn’t that bad either. When my parents first moved away from Wisconsin I needed a new place to stay for the summers and, concerned about upkeep of an empty house in the harsh winter, I opted for a downtown condo; it helped that downtown Madison was a beehive of activity with the university and state government, and I liked the idea of walking everywhere. Then came COVID and the summer of 2020, and suddenly downtown wasn’t so busy anymore; I found myself driving more than I expected, and feeling rather sick of condos, which I had lived in my entire adult life. And so, when a house opened up near an old friend, I snapped it up, remodeled it to my liking and then, this past year, decided to live there full time. It’s fashionable to hate on the suburbs, particularly for millenials just a bit younger than I am; I was born at the tail-end of Generation X, and my experience in small town Wisconsin was one of leaving the house in the morning on my bike and not coming home until dinner, hopefully in one piece. It was, all things considered, pretty idyllic, but I can imagine that the clampdown on youth freedom that happened over the last few decades, along with the rise of indoor activities like video games and smartphones, made the suburbs feel increasingly alienating and isolating. What a relief to move to the big city, particularly in the 2010’s when Uber came along. There were, in the 2010s, few companies more contentious than Uber, and not just because of the scandals and willingness to operate in the gray area of the law. There was a massive debate over whether or not the company was even a viable business. Hubert Horan, in his seemingly never-ending series insisting that Uber would never be profitable, twice attacked me personally (and dishonestly) for believing that Uber would scale into profitability: One does not have to immediately accept all of those conclusions to see that Thompson’s various claims suggesting that Uber might someday have a viable welfare enhancing business are not backed by any hard evidence about efficiency advantages or sustainable profitability. All of Uber’s growth has required massive investor subsidies — $2 billion in 2015 and $3 billion in 2016. All of these subsidies have been destroying competitors who are more efficient but can’t withstand years of subsidies from Silicon Valley billionaires. Thompson argues that Uber has grown total market demand and offered greater service options at night. True, but all due to unsustainable predatory subsidies. Thompson says that Uber’s app gives it the great competitive advantage of controlling its customers. False — people don’t like Uber because the app has a neat user interface, people like Uber because the app shows more cabs at lower prices than competitors can offer. All of those cabs and low prices are due to unsustainable, predatory subsidies. Thompson insists “the fact remains that both Uber riders and drivers continue to vote with their feet” justifies his belief that Uber’s approach to regulation is right, but again ignores that they are not voting for the more efficient producer, but for massive service subsidies. Thompson is falsely claiming that Uber’s growth reflects the free choice of consumers in a competitive market. Uber’s predatory subsidies are designed to undermine the processes by which competitive markets help allocate resources, and then to eliminate competition altogether. If these benefits were created by legitimate efficiencies, as Thompson imagines, there would be evidence showing how they made Uber more cost competitive, or how they similarly transformed competition in other markets. To refute the points here about Uber’s predatory, market-distorting subsidies, Thompson would need evidence that Uber has scale economies powerful enough to quickly convert $3 billion operating losses into sustainable profits, and evidence that Uber has competitive advantages overwhelming enough to explain driving everyone else out of the industry. Since Thompson does not have any of this evidence, he can’t claim Uber has produced benefits for anyone but itself. Well, here we are in 2025, and over the last 12 months Uber has made $4.5 billion in operating profit, and that number is trending upwards (and doesn’t include the significant profits Uber makes from its non-controlling interests in other mobility companies that it gained thanks to its aggressive expansion); no, I didn’t have evidence of that profit in 2017, but I did understand how scale works to transform money-losing software-based Aggregators into profitable behemoths in the long-run. Another classic of the Uber bear genre was this 2014 post by NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran attempting to determine Uber’s true value; the startup had just raised $1.2 billion at a $17 billion valuation, and according to Damodaran’s calculations, “it is difficult to justify a price greater than $10 billion” (his actual valuation was $5.9 billion). Investor Bill Gurley — before his dramatic powerplay that led to the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick — explained what Damodaran got wrong in How to Miss By a Mile: An Alternative Look at Uber’s Potential Market Size: The funny thing about “hard numbers” is that they can give a false sense of security. Young math students are warned about the critical difference between precision and accuracy. Financial models, especially valuation models, are interesting in that they can be particularly precise. A discounted cash flow model can lead to a result with two numbers right of the decimal for price-per-share. But what is the true accuracy of most of these financial models? While it may seem like a tough question to answer, I would argue that most practitioners of valuation analysis would state “not very high.” It is simply not an accurate science (the way physics is), and seemingly innocuous assumptions can have a major impact on the output. As a result, most models are used as a rough guide to see if you are “in the ball park,” or to see if a particular stock is either wildly under-valued or over-valued… Damodaran uses two primary assumptions that drive the core of his analysis. The first is TAM, and the second is Uber’s market share within that market. For the market size, he states, “For my base case valuation, I’m going to assume that the primary market Uber is targeting is the global taxi and car-service market.” He then goes on to calculate a global estimate for the historical taxi and limousine market. The number he uses for this TAM estimate is $100 billion. He then guesses at a market share limit for Uber – basically a maximum in terms of market share the company could potentially achieve. For this he settles on 10%. The rest of his model is rather straightforward and typical. In my view, there is a critical error in both of these two core assumptions. Gurley argued — correctly in retrospect, given that Uber’s gross bookings over the last 12 months were $93 billion in rides and $86 billion in deliveries — that Damodaran failed to consider how a radically better experience could dramatically expand the addressable market, and completely missed the potential for network effects leading to an outsized share of that expanded market. I do feel Uber’s effects even out here in the suburbs: when I lived in Madison decades ago, there only seemed to be about five taxis in the whole city, and they were only ever at the airport; now a ride is six minutes away, and I’m sure it would be even shorter if I were more centrally located. That’s particularly appreciated in a place like Wisconsin, not only because of the cold, but also the culture of drinking; the reduction in drunk driving alone has long placed Uber solidly on the “societal good” side of the ledger, at least in my book. Of course I rarely take Ubers: if you’re in the suburbs you drive, and fortunately, I like driving. That’s not the case for everyone, however: while my wife has driven in Taiwan for years, she’s always been nervous about doing the same in America, with its higher speeds, longer distances, and more uncertain directions. That’s why I got her a Tesla: instead of her driving the car, her car drives her. I’ve actually dawdled in writing this Article because I wanted to try out v14 of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) first, but it’s been over a month since its release and I still don’t have the Update, so my experience is based on v13. That’s ok, though, because Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is actually pretty amazing. It really does go from origin to destination without intervention pretty much all-of-the-time (v14 reportedly addresses the actually leaving the driveway and parking part of things), although I take over more than my wife does. My issue with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is two-fold: the first is that it is the absolute best worst driver in the world. What I mean is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) always handles the situation in front of it with aplomb, including tricky merges, construction, etc. I’m particularly impressed at how it stays with traffic, including speeding when appropriate. That’s the best part. The worst part is that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) seems to have zero planning: it will change lanes even though a turn or an exit is half a mile away, which is particularly galling when an exit lane is backed up; if you don’t take over that leads to an embarrassing attempt to merge back in a quarter mile down the road. In other words, Full Self-Driving (Supervised) gets in more messes than it should because of a lack of foresight, but it handles those messes perfectly. As someone who thinks well ahead of my route in an endless pursuit of efficiency this drives me crazy, but honestly, I would take best worst driver over the vast majority of drivers I encounter on the road. My second issue is related to why I keep writing out the whole name: the “Supervised” part drives me absolutely batty. Yes, yes, I shouldn’t look at my phone, but is it better to be forced to exit a perfectly competent — more than competent — driving mode to manually steer while sending a text? More galling is when I am looking ahead at a turn — which necessitates turning my head — and get yelled at by my own car to pay attention. I am paying attention, by actually trying to plan more than two steps ahead! Regardless, I absolutely do believe that Full Self-Driving (Supervised) is good enough to be Unsupervised, at least in good weather; it’s a bummer to realize that that still may not happen for a long time, and even when it does, the price may be things like actually flowing with traffic, even if it’s a few miles over the speed limit. Even then, however, what exists today — and make no mistake, Full Self-Driving (Supervised), with its ability to follow a route, is a step-change from lane-following adaptive cruise control — is enough to make a meaningful difference to someone like my wife. It’s a lot easier to enjoy the big house and yard when you have the capability to go somewhere else. One challenge I didn’t anticipate was that while trash pickup comes once a week, recycling pick-up is only every other week; that’s a problem given the number of cardboard boxes we go through, mostly from Amazon. In all seriousness, Amazon has transformed suburban living. It was always the case that the idea of dashing off to the nearby store was more theory than reality, even when I lived downtown; at a minimum I usually still drove. Next day delivery, however, completely changes the mental calculus: the likelihood I will run out of time to go to the store tips the balance towards just ordering what you need the moment you need it; the next day — and sometimes sooner — it’s on your porch (Walmart deserves a callout here: their delivery is usually even faster if you order something in store). Of course it’s nice to not have to worry about your delivery disappearing, or have to cart it up the stairs or in the elevator; you also have the suburban advantage of having places to store supplies, so you don’t run out in the first place. That was always true though — it’s why big box retailers were very much a product of the suburbs — but marrying that advantage to maximum convenience is a big win. Food delivery definitely isn’t as good, particularly for the Asian food I sometimes crave; our family has always been one to cook our own food, however, which is of course easier with a big kitchen (and three different types of grills). The better restaurant options are also all downtown, so that’s a minus, but hey, you can always Uber. The broader takeaway is that while there are still certain conveniences that come from a central location, the convenience delta — thanks first and foremost to Amazon — has been dramatically reduced. There is a point to this diary, and it comes back to Uber. Not only was I a bull during Uber’s rise, I’ve also been fairly optimistic about the company’s fortunes when it comes to robotaxis. From an Update late last year: Robotaxis are a technology, not a market — a means, not an end, if you will. Markets are defined by demand, and the demand to be tapped is transportation. And, in this market, the dominant player is Uber; no they don’t have their own robotaxis, but from a consumer perspective, they might as well: the rider doesn’t own the vehicle they ride in, they summon it from an app, and they just walk away when the ride is done. The experience — if not the novelty — is the same with a human driver or a robotaxi. Moreover, the human drivers come with some big advantages from Uber’s perspective: they bear their own depreciation costs, and can make individual decisions about the marginal rate necessary to provide supply, which is another way of saying that Uber can more easily scale up and down to meet demand by using price as a signal. It is an open question as to whether robotaxis can ever economically scale to meet demand: having enough capacity for peak demand means a lot of robotaxis sitting idle a lot of the time, while maximizing utilization means insufficient supply during peak periods. This last point is why my assumption is that Uber will very much be relevant in the robotaxi era: their supply network will be essential for scaling up-and-down within cities, and serving all of the areas that the centralized fleets do not. What is less clear is their long-term profitability, which may be somewhat out of their control. That last sentence was about Uber’s diminished bargaining vis-à-vis a centralized robotaxi operator versus individual drivers, and it’s an important one in terms of Uber’s long-term valuation. However, as robotaxis continue to expand — Waymo is now in five cities (three via their own service, two via Uber), Tesla (with human supervisors in the car) in two, and Amazon’s Zoox in one — I do wonder if I am making a similar mistake to Horan and Damodaran. First, like Horan, am I too caught up in the current economics of robotaxis? As an apostle of zero marginal costs I am intrinsically allergic to the depreciation inherent in the cars themselves, along with the significant marginal costs in terms of energy and insurance; Uber side-stepped this by offloading those costs to the drivers. Can scale solve this? At some point — Cybercab already points to this future — vehicles will be purpose-built at scale to be robotaxis, and my experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) has me convinced that insurance costs will be manageable, not just because of scale, but because there will be fewer accidents. Second, like Damodaran, am I limiting my thinking by focusing on the current market — even if that market is already massively larger than the taxi & limo market ever was? The experience of a Waymo is certainly magical; it’s also peaceful, and by removing the human from the equation, provides a sense of safety and security that Uber has always struggled with. This last point could address a major suburban point point, which is kids: the lockdown in kids’ freedom corresponded with a dramatic rise in organized activities, the sheer volume of which leaves lots of parents feeling like unpaid Uber drivers themselves. Some may rely on Uber to solve this problem; it seems likely to me far more would be willing to entrust their children to a Waymo. That does still leave the peak demand question: even if kids become a major market, what do all of these rapidly depreciating cars do during the day? And thus we arrive at why Amazon acquire Zoox: the obvious answer is delivery. The only thing better than next day delivery is same day delivery; the only thing better than same day delivery is same hour delivery. The best way to make that happen in a cost-effective way is to have a huge number of robotaxis on the road that actually aren’t making the decision that prices aren’t high enough, at least as long as those prices cover the marginal cost of a trip, which, in the case of a robotaxi, includes energy but not a human. Of course you still have to get the package to the doorstep, which is where robots come in; Tesla is explicitly going in this directions. From The Information: Optimus is Tesla’s biggest long-term bet. Musk has said there will eventually be more humanoid robots than cars in the world, and that Optimus will one day be responsible for about 80% of Tesla’s market capitalization. Inside Tesla, he’s pushed the Optimus team to find ways to use the robot in tandem with another big, nearer-term bet: the Cybercab, according to a person with direct knowledge. That includes Musk’s desire to have the Optimus robot sit in the Cybercab so it can deliver packages. That should be possible: newer versions of the Optimus robot are capable of consistently lifting and moving around with roughly 25-pound objects for three to four hours on a 30 minute charge, another person with direct knowledge said. But the connection between the robot’s torso and legs isn’t flexible enough to allow it to seamlessly get in and out of a Cybercab, according to the first person. Tesla would need to redesign the robot to change that or use a different vehicle for deliveries more tailored for Optimus’ shape, that person said. This is obviously all still a ways out, but it all feels a lot more possible today than it did even a year ago; relatedly, it feels a lot more uncertain that Uber will have a long-term role to play — and the company may agree! I thought this announcement from Nvidia at GTC Washington D.C. was a bearish indicator for the company: Nvidia today announced it is partnering with Uber to scale the world’s largest level 4-ready mobility network, using the company’s next-generation robotaxi and autonomous delivery fleets, the new Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 autonomous vehicle (AV) development platform and Nvidia Drive AV software purpose-built for L4 autonomy. By enabling faster growth across the level 4 ecosystem, Nvidia can support Uber in scaling its global autonomous fleet to 100,000 vehicles over time, starting in 2027. These vehicles will be developed in collaboration with Nvidia and other Uber ecosystem partners, using Nvidia Drive. Nvidia and Uber are also working together to develop a data factory accelerated by the Nvidia Cosmos world foundation model development platform to curate and process data needed for autonomous vehicle development. Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion 10 is a reference production computer and sensor set architecture that makes any vehicle L4-ready. It enables automakers to build cars, trucks and vans equipped with validated hardware and sensors that can host any compatible autonomous-driving software, providing a unified foundation for safe, scalable and AI-defined mobility. Uber is bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network — a unified ride-hailing service including both human and robot drivers. This network, powered by Nvidia Drive AGX Hyperion-ready vehicles and the surrounding AI ecosystem, enables Uber to seamlessly bridge today’s human-driven mobility with the autonomous fleets of tomorrow. The thing about Uber the first time around is that it wasn’t simply providing a fancy app for the taxi & limo market; it was providing an entirely new experience for both drivers and riders that was orthogonal to that market, which let it create a far larger one. This deal with Nvidia envisions a different sort of evolution, where Uber’s existing market slowly becomes autonomous; that’s possible, even if it means significantly higher capital costs for Uber (and cars that cost more, since they are retrofitted instead of purpose-built). What is also possible, however, is that Uber gets Uber-ed: a completely new experience for both drivers (as in they don’t exist) and riders (including kids and packages delivered at the marginal cost of energy) ends up being orthogonal to the Uber market, and far larger. Moreover, this market will, for specific qualitative reasons around safety and security, be inaccessible to Uber’s core business, meaning the entire vision of “bringing together human drivers and autonomous vehicles into a single operating network” ends up being a liability instead of an asset. There are larger sociological and political questions around things like urban versus suburban living, just as there were when suburbs were built out in the first place. I do believe that the suburbs are very much back, and not just because I’m back in the suburbs; what will be a fascinating question for historians is the chicken-and-egg one between technology driving this shift, versus benefiting from it. What is worth considering, however, is if the last wave of urbanism, which started in the 1990s and peaked in the 2010s, might be the last, at least in the United States (Asia and its massive metropolises are another story). The potential physical transformation in transportation and delivery I am talking about is simply completing the story that started with entertainment and television in the first wave of suburbia, and then information and interactivity via the Internet, particularly since COVID. There are real benefits to being in person, just like there are to living in the city, but the relative delta to working remote or living in the suburbs has decreased dramatically; meanwhile, offices and urban living can never match the advantages inherent to working from a big home with a big yard. Whether or not this is good thing is a separate discussion; I will say it has been good for me, and it’s poised to get even better.

Now, he is bringing his management skills to an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up with fewer than 100 employees. Project Prometheus, which Mr Bezos co-founded with scientist Vik Bajaj, will use AI to accelerate engineering and manufacturing in fields like aerospace and cars, The New York Times reported. The start-up has US$6.2 billion (S$8 billion) in funding, sourced in part from Mr Bezos himself, and employees counted in the dozens, some of whom were poached from leading AI labs like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. As co-CEO with Mr Bajaj, Mr Bezos is back in a formal executive post for the first time since stepping down from Amazon in 2021. The billionaire has since devoted time to his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and made headlines for his personal life, including a star-studded wedding in Venice in 2025. Mr Bezos has also more closely aligned himself with President Donald Trump’s administration, attending his inauguration in January and ordering a pro-business revamp of the opinion page at the Washington Post, the news media outlet he owns. Project Prometheus enters a crowded AI market dominated by tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, alongside pioneering firms OpenAI and Anthropic. The venture is part of a broader trend towards applying AI to physical tasks, often using robotics. Unlike the generative AI technology behind ChatGPT, it aims to develop systems that learn from real-world experimentation, rather than just digital text, with the goal of accelerating scientific discovery in physics, chemistry and engineering. Another dramatic shift since Mr Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 is the rise of AI-native start-ups built around ultra-lean teams – a reversal of the old playbook that equated headcount expansion with business growth. When Mr Bezos left the CEO seat at Amazon, he oversaw more than 1.6 million employees. On the company’s most recent earnings call, current CEO Andy Jassy attributed thousands of recent layoffs to ongoing efforts to eliminate layers of bureaucracy after years of over-hiring. Some parts of Mr Bezos’ philosophies may require a reboot for the AI era. His preference for lengthy memos with narratives indicating deep thinking by the author may be outdated now that workers can use generative AI tools to do the writing for them. But his Darwinian approach to work culture jibes with what is expected now at many of the hottest AI start-ups. And some of his management ideals, like keeping teams lean and fast and making them exceptionally talent-dense, will arguably never go out of style. When Mr Bezos stepped down after 27 years of running Amazon, he was widely lauded as one of the best CEOs in tech history. If his new start-up succeeds, it will likely come down in part to how relevant his management philosophy still is – or how much it has evolved.

Title: Dutta Dismantles the Fed's Rate-Hold Case

Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta says the Federal Reserve is on the verge of making a serious policy mistake as various officials drift toward keeping rates steady instead of cutting next month. Dutta argues in a client note published Monday that officials have misread the labor market, overstated inflation risks, and are now preparing to abandon proactive policy as conditions deteriorate. The inflation picture, Dutta writes, looks far less threatening than the hawks contend. Throughout 2025, the narrative around tariff pass-through has shifted repeatedly. First came predictions that firms would raise prices preemptively. Then the theory was that companies would draw down inventories first. Now officials are waiting for price increases to arrive next year. Yet inflation has consistently disappointed these predictions. “What’s clear is that since tariffs have been put on, inflation has generally come in weaker than expected,” Dutta writes. “This would imply less pass-through than expected.” Core PCE has moderated over six months. Used car prices, which lead consumer inflation by roughly three months, have plummeted. Rental inflation is weakening. Restaurants are holding prices to preserve market share. The disinflationary pressures are mounting, not receding. On the labor market, Dutta delivers an equally withering assessment. The problem isn’t tight labor supply from immigration enforcement, he argues. It’s flagging demand. Job vacancies are declining. Underemployment is rising. The payroll diffusion index—a gauge of whether job gains are concentrated in a few sectors or spread broadly across the economy—has stayed below 50 percent since April, meaning weakness is spreading across industries. Real wages are falling fastest for workers most likely to compete with undocumented immigrants, the opposite of what tight labor supply would produce. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has leaned heavily on low jobless claims as evidence of stability. Dutta says Powell is reading the data incorrectly. “Initial claims are less a leading indicator and more an indicator that just happens to come out every week,” he writes. Claims tend rise after hiring has already declined sharply, not before. Waiting for claims to rise when other indicators point to labor market softness risks putting the Fed behind the curve. “When companies like Verizon, Amazon, and Target are all announcing layoffs around the same time, one would expect at least some follow-through into measures like initial claims,” Dutta writes. The gravest risk, Dutta warns, isn’t what the Fed does in December. It’s what skipping December signals. “If the Fed does nothing next month, they won’t do anything in January. You don’t skip one month if you think you are going the next,” he writes. Skipping signals that the central bank has abandoned proactive policy and will wait for obvious damage before acting.

Title: Major MMO Is Coming To Steam With A $50 Alpha Test, Which Is Actually A Discount

Ashes of Creation could be the next big MMO, if it ever releases in full. By Cameron Koch on November 17, 2025 at 9:32AM PST Indie MMORPG Ashes of Creation, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to Steam. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50. That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation website. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam. Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play. Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ. "Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states. Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from. "Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players." Ashes of Creation ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to pay $500 for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--one set in the Warhammer universe and another called project Ghost led by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street. Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of active development on its MMO New World, which once had more than 900,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the same time, Amazon also announced it was canceling a new Lord of the Rings MMO. It was, strangely, not the first time that has happened. A similar story played out at Microsoft earlier this year, when layoffs at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios led to the cancelation of a new, unannounced sci-fi MMO.

Title: The Glassing of the Drones and the Future of those Regions

“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.” -Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises. One of the crazy aspects of the collapse of Pandemic Horde as an alliance has been how suddenly everything fell to pieces for them. As with the Hemingway quote, they seemed to be failing slowly for quite a while… pulling back as we moved forward, giving up whole regions without a fight… and then everything fell apart. I have a post in mind to trace that path, to put a timeline and some structure around it. But that is something for another day. This past week saw the Imperium wrapped up in taking apart the Drone regions, one structure at a time. That started with the Keepstar in R-AG7W, which feels like it blew up ages ago, but it was just last week. The Keepstar finally boiling over into a wreck Then there was a brief respite or maybe a day or two when people moved back to Insmother after the big event when we were deploying back again to the Keepstar we dropped in the system, or to the Keepstar that Solyaris Chtonium sold us, to start setting timers on structures. I got out there on my main and my alt, each in a Kikimora, each loaded up with Occult, the high damage, short range ammo preferred for structure bashing, and then started going on structure shoot fleets. My Kikimora on its way For a few days it was almost bizarre out in the Drone regions it was so quiet. We had fleets moving all over, but there were almost no hostiles to be seen. We had temp blued Solyaris Chtonium as part of the Keepstar deal so they could move north to setup shop with Fraternity as WinterCo without us shooting them. Likewise, Northern Coalition, NCDot, also betrayed by Pandemic Horde, was focused on move ops out of the Drones and into the north. There were regular camps at a couple of the regional gates getting into the Drone regions, but within the regions itself it was often safe to simply move around on your own. That changed as the weekend arrived and other groups saw some opportunities to camp gates within the Drones and drop on unwary Imperium pilots lulled into a false sense of security after a few days of quiet. That led to a titan out shooting structures getting dropped on and destroyed. Pings went out to remind people not to randomly drive caps around in space where hostiles were hunting. I was in a fleet of Kikis shooting a Tatara that got hot dropped by Hard Knocks Citizens just as we were almost done. They blew up a couple of our ships as we warped off, then proceeded to finish off the structure for us, so we all got on that kill mail. Our job done, we moved on to the next target assigned. They didn’t follow, but they had a fax in tow, so they weren’t going to chase a bunch of destroyers around. Kikis moving on to the next target Target assignments were often a study in chaos management. There were a couplel hundred timers reports to be on the tracking board that our operational coordination group was using, and as new timers came up we often had to split our fleets or get a timer deep enough in so that we could run off to the next timer and let somebody else follow up and hopefully pick up where we left off before the structure self repair finished. This meme was posted during one of our fleets on Saturday morning my time. We were certainly in demand I have been in more system in the Drone regions in the last few days than I have probably been in the last decade. And we kept on rolling, gating to the next location and shooting to set the next structure timer. Kikis orbiting the FC in a Monitor Even in the chaos, a lot of structures went down. The Imperium killed five Keepstars on Friday the 14th.. The Keepstar Count for November 14 That is the most Keepstars killed in a single day that I can recall, something that seems confirmed by looking down the list of Keepstar losses over on zKillboard. I wrote about us blowing up three in a single day back in 2023. Now the benchmark is five, so it wasn’t as big of a deal when we blew up four more on the 15th I suppose. We did manage five more within a 24 hour period starting Sunday and ending today. I did not get on any of those kills. In fact, I spent so much time on Saturday setting timers that I was starting to think that “No killmails for Kikis” might be on the coord guidelines. But there was so much to be done that there was no way to keep up with all the timers and get everybody on the big kills. And I did end up getting on a few. All I need is a few explosions to be happy. Another fiery structure death Overall, a crazy amount of stuff has been destroyed. More than once we found ourselves shooting the wrong structure because there were so many possible timers. I burned through at least 15K rounds of Occult, the close range, high damage small Trig ammo. I saw somebody out in our fleets with a laser fit Gnosis and was jealous. Lasers are the way to go. We need a laser doctrine for bashing. Laser Gnosis shooting a fort As for the destruction, I haven’t seen a total count yet. There was a battle report put together for late Thursday to early Friday last week that showed 2.9 trillion ISK destroyed… and less than a billion of it was ours. Battle Report Header If you go to that link and scroll down the list, you will see a lot of dead structures. And that sort of thing carried on all through the weekend. Somebody will calculate a total at some point I am sure. Meanwhile, Pandemic Horde has been slimming down to become that smaller, elite PvP organization that was promised in past announcements from their leadership. Top Ten Alliances – October 15 vs. November 15 Fraternity, Insidious, and The Initiative seem to be the biggest recipients of PH refugees. I suspect that the outflow isn’t higher because the corps that could negotiate a move because they had a reputation or record to recommend them did. That left behind smaller and more casual corps, plus all the characters in the PH run corps like Pandemic Horde Inc, A Blessed Bean, and Horde Vanguard have to move on their own, and other alliances are busy with corporation moves and probably ignoring single players. Then there are the AFK players who are going to come back to a surprise. And then there is the future of the Drone regions. Asher posted an update to Reddit last night that said the following: Here is the path going forward: Sov: We intend to hold the ihub in G-QTSD and nowhere else. Please start attempting to take sov on Wednesday, we kindly ask if you are taking sov ignore the Imperium glassing fleets, they will do the same to you. The slower it goes for us the longer we’ll be in your future space. Structures: We have glassed many trillions of isk in structures, at one point our timerboard had 635 timers on it. The majority are dead but many still remain which we will be destroying over the next week. If you want to move in – any structure that begins anchoring Saturday the 22nd eve time 00:01 will be considered safe from glassing. We will not destroy any structure that begins anchoring after this time. We may still finish up previous timers after this date expires but we plan to undeploy from the dronelands by the end of this coming weekend. Freeports: Freeport keepstars are in LXQ2-T, 9WVY-F, and F9-FUV. These will contains markets but not jump clones. They will be freeports open to all alliances except Pandemic Horde. You may use them for logistics security, to stage out of, whatever you desire. We are intentionally not putting cloning in to make them less desirable than setting up your own citadel. We will not be holding sov in these freeport systems, you are free to take the sov, moons, etc but not cyno jam the system. We will defend the keepstars from refs – we will reset sov/destroy cyno jammers as needed, so that general logistics security is assured in the dronelands. Overall our hope is that you can find a space where you can grow and flourish. We have burnt down the old monoculture renting forest and we hope a thriving ecosystem will grow. We will not be enforcing byzantine agreements or trying to force people into a fake nullsec with rules meant to keep you from playing the game. Good luck in the dronelands! So we will continue burning things down until we’re done. Some groups have already started moving into the region. We actually hit Keepstar in a system that Brotherhood of Spacers, who used to live in Venal until WinterCo pushed them out in the B2 war, and they pulled out a titan and gave us a ride to our next destination. We were clearing out their future home after all. A B0SS titan waiting to give us a ride We did get a little frisky when Asher warped us over to one of their structures and some people started shooting it… I mean, it is what we had been doing for days, right? No harm no foul though, it was just the shield that took a few hits. Overall it has been a busy few days… week… however long it has been since we jumped into the region feet first. My participation count is up considerably from past months. What have I been up to? That number isn’t a brag… I’d get laughed out of any contest with just that number given how many ops some people are running. I went on fleets with Reageaan at opposite ends of the clock where I slept in between and I am pretty sure he did not. And we get credit for every account that goes along, so I dual-boxed some fleets. But that means that guy with 6 Catalysts in every op I went on was getting 3x to 6x the credit. The number is just an indicator of how much time I’ve spent playing relative to the past couple of months. (That number went up to 50 as I went on ops while writing this, but didn’t want to take a new screen shot. Also, coord gives us bonus credit occasionally for long or annoying ops, so that Woosi fleet where we were sent all over space got us triple credit.) Soon enough we’ll be done, the Drone regions will be clear and we’ll head home and see what develops in this new open section of null sec. Related: I’m very interested to see what becomes of the drone lands. Years ago I’ve written about my time in the Interstellar Starbase Syndicate and their take on a FFA nullsec (jeez…almost twenty years ago!). That didn’t go so well. Then again, we didn’t have a 60k pilot alliance to ensure its freedom, so… LikeLike I’m also hopeful but a little skeptical of its future. I know Asher has done his utmost to make the rules as simple as possible. But I’m afraid the chain reaction of batphones that may occur if/when there’s a big fight will drag him into the type of rules lawyering they’re trying to avoid. Mission creep will set in, unless every single group can avoid any appearance of being a proxy or connected to a bloc in any way. Will that happen? Maybe, who knows. But if a casino was offering even odds on the matter, I’d bet against it. LikeLike As always, we are fighting human nature, and the odds in that fight are never good.

Dividend stocks are not traditionally known for their share price rallies. Companies making distributions to stockholders tend to be stable and well-established, with their biggest growth days long in the past. Similarly, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold baskets of dividend stocks tend to provide investors with a healthy passive income stream simply for owning shares rather than capital appreciation. Occasionally, though, investors can find the best of both worlds. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VEA), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA: EFA), and SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: SPYV) are three ETFs that pay noteworthy dividends and deliver notable capital appreciation. While not the highest of any ETF making distributions, the dividends are still enough to provide a compelling perk for shareholders—especially considering these ETFs are trading at or near year-to-date (YTD) highs after experiencing sizable rallies. VEA capitalizes on the strong performance of many international equity markets in 2025, some of which have outpaced the S&P 500's already robust 15% returns YTD. The fund can be a long-term investment option for investors seeking access to non-U.S. equities. Like many other broad-based Vanguard ETFs, it boasts a highly competitive expense ratio—just 0.03% per year. Comprised of nearly 4,000 total stocks, VEA offers a highly diversified group of stocks at a low cost. The fund's geographic and stock mandates are expansive, as it holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum from Canada, Europe, and parts of the Pacific, with European stocks comprising 52% of its holdings. Japan is the single largest country by portfolio allocation, accounting for approximately 21% of the portfolio. VEA pays out a dividend yield of 2.74%, which is quite high for a fund that doesn't specifically employ a dividend strategy. On top of that, the fund has rallied by close to 29% YTD, or about twice the return rate of the broader U.S. market during that period. Utilizing a similar approach to VEA, EFA distinguishes itself with its large-cap focus. Both funds are sizable and trade very actively, although EFA's trading volume tends to be higher than VEA's, making it a prime choice for traders looking to move in and out of positions more frequently. EFA's basket of stocks is not as extensive as VEA's, but with nearly 1,000 holdings, it still offers exceptional diversification. While the portfolio focuses on European names, Japanese stocks represent the largest portion of the portfolio, at approximately 22%. The fund also invests in a smaller percentage of Australian equities, which may appeal to investors seeking a specific geographic tilt. Where EFA falls short a bit is in its annual fee, which is substantially higher at 0.32%. Still, with an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and YTD returns of nearly 29%, there are plenty of benefits to considering this fund nonetheless. The SPYV adopts a different approach from the two above. Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Dividend stocks are not traditionally known for their share price rallies. Companies making distributions to stockholders tend to be stable and well-established, with their biggest growth days long in the past. Similarly, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold baskets of dividend stocks tend to provide investors with a healthy passive income stream simply for owning shares rather than capital appreciation. Occasionally, though, investors can find the best of both worlds. Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VEA), iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSEARCA: EFA), and SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA: SPYV) are three ETFs that pay noteworthy dividends and deliver notable capital appreciation. While not the highest of any ETF making distributions, the dividends are still enough to provide a compelling perk for shareholders—especially considering these ETFs are trading at or near year-to-date (YTD) highs after experiencing sizable rallies. VEA capitalizes on the strong performance of many international equity markets in 2025, some of which have outpaced the S&P 500's already robust 15% returns YTD. The fund can be a long-term investment option for investors seeking access to non-U.S. equities. Like many other broad-based Vanguard ETFs, it boasts a highly competitive expense ratio—just 0.03% per year. Comprised of nearly 4,000 total stocks, VEA offers a highly diversified group of stocks at a low cost. The fund's geographic and stock mandates are expansive, as it holds companies across the market capitalization spectrum from Canada, Europe, and parts of the Pacific, with European stocks comprising 52% of its holdings. Japan is the single largest country by portfolio allocation, accounting for approximately 21% of the portfolio. VEA pays out a dividend yield of 2.74%, which is quite high for a fund that doesn't specifically employ a dividend strategy. On top of that, the fund has rallied by close to 29% YTD, or about twice the return rate of the broader U.S. market during that period. Utilizing a similar approach to VEA, EFA distinguishes itself with its large-cap focus. Both funds are sizable and trade very actively, although EFA's trading volume tends to be higher than VEA's, making it a prime choice for traders looking to move in and out of positions more frequently. EFA's basket of stocks is not as extensive as VEA's, but with nearly 1,000 holdings, it still offers exceptional diversification. While the portfolio focuses on European names, Japanese stocks represent the largest portion of the portfolio, at approximately 22%. The fund also invests in a smaller percentage of Australian equities, which may appeal to investors seeking a specific geographic tilt. Where EFA falls short a bit is in its annual fee, which is substantially higher at 0.32%. Still, with an annual dividend yield of 2.7% and YTD returns of nearly 29%, there are plenty of benefits to considering this fund nonetheless. The SPYV adopts a different approach from the two above. Besides its exclusive focus on U.S. equities, SPYV also narrows the search further by tracking large-cap stocks with value characteristics such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. Although its portfolio comprises nearly 400 positions, SPYV prioritizes three major companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) collectively represent approximately 20% of invested assets. At 1.83%, SPYV's dividend yield is slightly lower than that of the funds above, but it is still a nice bonus for investors interested in a value play. SPYV's momentum has been accelerating after an early-2025 dip, and the fund is up about 13% YTD. With an annual fee of 0.04%, SPYV may be a good buy-and-hold option for investors looking to capture undervalued stocks across sectors, with a bit of a passive income benefit thrown in for good measure.

Title: One Fed Governor Sees Half-Point Cut in December: Our Top 7% and 8% Dividend Stock Picks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO) is one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of cigarettes and other tobacco-related products. This stock offers value investors a compelling entry point, along with a generous dividend yield of 7.09%. Altria manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. The company’s dividend payout is based on free cash flow, ranging from about 64% to 80% per quarter. In recent quarters, free cash flow has exceeded dividend payments, providing a solid buffer. Altria generates strong cash flow from its core tobacco business, which provides a stable base, albeit with regulatory risk, and yields are among the highest in the S&P 500, at least for now. The company primarily sells cigarettes under the Marlboro brand, as well as: It sells its tobacco products primarily to wholesalers, including distributors and large retail organizations, such as chain stores. Altria used to own over 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A. (NYSE: BUD), the world’s largest brewer. Last year, the company sold 35 million of its 197 million shares through a global secondary offering. That represents 18% of its holdings but still leaves 8% of the outstanding shares in its back pocket. Altria also announced a $2.4 billion stock repurchase plan partially funded by the sale. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a $72 target price. Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) owns one of the largest portfolios of upscale, select-service hotels in the United States. It is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that pays a solid 8.15% monthly dividend and stands out in the market with its unique offering. The company has 224 hotels with more than 30,066 guest rooms across 87 markets in 37 states, plus one property leased to third parties. Its hotel portfolio includes 100 Marriott-branded hotels, 119 Hilton-branded hotels, and five Hyatt-branded hotels. They are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, including: Apple Hospitality hotels are in various states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, and others. Cantor Fitzgerald has an Overweight rating with a target price of $14. This top master limited partnership is one of North America’s largest and most diversified midstream energy companies. Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE: ET) is a safe option for investors seeking energy exposure and income, as the company pays a substantial 7.91% distribution. It owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. It has a strategic footprint in all the major domestic oil and gas production basins. Energy Transfer operates one of the largest integrated midstream systems in the U.S., with nearly 107,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 235 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of storage capacity. Its strong presence in Texas, particularly in the Permian Basin, provides it with access to some of the country’s most affordable natural gas. The company is receiving significant inquiries for pipeline projects to serve power plants (45 plants across 11 states) and data centers (over 40 prospective projects), with potential demand exceeding 5 Bcf/d for power plants and 3 Bcf/d for data centers. The company is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations that include: Following the acquisition of Enable Partners in December 2021, Energy Transfer owns and operates over 114,000 miles of pipelines and related assets in 41 states, spanning all major U.S. producing regions and markets. This further solidifies its leadership position in the midstream sector. Through its ownership of Energy Transfer Operating, formerly known as Energy Transfer Partners, the company also owns Lake Charles LNG Company; the general partner interests, incentive distribution rights, and 28.5 million standard units of Sunoco L.P. (NYSE: SUN); and the public partner interests and 39.7 million standard units of USA Compression Partners L.P. (NYSE: USAC). Barclays has given the stock a Buy rating with a target price of $25. Chevron acquired a 37.5% stake in Hess Midstream L.P. (NYSE: HESM) when it completed the purchase of Hess back in the summer. With a stellar 8.77% dividend on a sprawling midstream asset base, this is an incredible stock to consider now. Hess Midstream owns, operates, develops, and acquires a diverse set of midstream assets to provide services to the company and its third-party customers. The company owns oil, gas, and water handling assets located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin area in North Dakota.

Title: Peter Thiel slashes Tesla (TSLA) stake as Elon Musk warns shorts
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/11/17/peter-thiel-slashes-tesla-tsla-stake-as-elon-musk-warns-shorts/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T13:34:09Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel’s fund, Thiel Macro LLC, has significantly cut its position in Tesla (TSLA), according to a new Q3 2025 13F filing. Thiel, who is close to Musk, is retreating from his Tesla investment at a time when the CEO told shareholders to “hold on” to their stocks and warned TSLA shorts. The filing, which covers the period ending September 30, shows the fund sold 207,613 TSLA shares during the quarter. This reduces its stake by over 76%, from 272,613 shares at the end of Q2 to just 65,000 shares remaining. Thiel famously co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk and is still close to Tesla’s CEO. They have both recently referenced having conversations, and they collaborated in their support of President Trump in last year’s US elections, as well as during the transition. Interestingly, Thiel appears to be ignoring his friend’s advice in divesting from Tesla. As Tesla shareholders voted to give Musk the biggest CEO compensation package ever, Musk told them to “hold on to their stocks.” Just this past weekend, Musk issued a specific warning to those betting against Tesla’s stock, and specifically Bill Gates, via a post on X (formerly Twitter), regarding Gates’ long-held short position against Tesla. Responding to news that the Gates Foundation was selling Microsoft stock, Musk posted: “If Gates hasn’t fully closed out the crazy short position he has held against Tesla for ~8 years, he had better do so soon.” The sale of Tesla stocks wasn’t the most significant move in Thiel’s latest filing. The fund’s most significant move was exiting its entire stake in Nvidia (NVDA), selling over 537,000 shares, a position that had been its largest. Thiel Macro also completely sold off its holdings in Vistra Energy. This appears to be a major consolidation and a pivot away from high-growth momentum stocks. In their place, the fund added new, more traditional “Big Tech” positions, namely in Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). The aggressive sales shrank the fund’s total reported US equity value from $212 million down to just $74.4 million. To be fair, Thiel’s overall rebalancing appears to stem more from broader market fear than from anything specific about Tesla. However, it does highlight that Tesla’s volatile stock is risky amid a potential market pullback. Yup, super Tesla fan Cathy Woods is directing her firm to sell Tesla too. Tesla shares are at least 10x any reasonable valuation. Only gullible retail investors and index funds are propping it up. When it crashes, it will be fast. It currently trades at a 275 price-to-earnings ratio, which is expected to keep rising this quarter, even if the stock continues to drop from its recent high, as earnings are expected to decline further in Q4. Now, this is not financial advice, but I think it’s worth noting that even though Tesla’s stock hasn’t been linked to its fundamentals in a while, its most significant stock price growth occurred during its period of earnings growth. These days, it’s hard to imagine Tesla going back to earnings growth any time soon. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: Give a Nazi an Inch… And Other Important Lessons From Weimar, Germany
URL: https://lithub.com/give-a-nazi-an-inch-and-other-important-lessons-from-weimar-germany/
Time Published: 2025-11-17T09:59:24Z
Full Content:
On January 23, 1930, there was a heated debate in the parliament of the regional state of Thuringia about the formation of a new right-­wing government including one of Hitler’s most ardent followers and a co-­putschist of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, as minister of the interior and public education. The debate began with the former state premier and SPD parliamentary group leader, August Frölich, criticizing the fact that the president of the parliament had taken down the democratic black, red, and gold flag from the building. Was this intended to demonstrate, he asked, “that the colors of the Third Reich under Hitler and Frick should take the place of the national colors?” In Frick, the speaker continued, “a high traitor”—­who had already broken his oath to the constitution as a Bavarian civil servant and who had never made a secret of his opposition to the parliamentary-­democratic system—­“has been appointed a minister in charge of the [regional] constitution.” The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. Frölich recalled that Frick had pleaded in the Reichstag for amnesty to be given to Ernst Werner Techow, who had been involved in Rathenau’s murder, and had demanded impunity for the Erzberger assassins, Schulz and Tillessen. He reminded the DVP, which wanted to join the right-­wing government, that not long ago, in December 1929, Frick had vilified the late Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann as a paid foreign agent for accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. Repeatedly interrupted by the National Socialists, Frölich concluded his speech with the words: “The election of Mr. Frick makes today a day of political and cultural shame for Thuringia.” That afternoon DVP parliamentary group leader Georg Witzmann tried to justify his party’s stance. Despite considerable reservations, he said, his party had decided to join the government in the spirit of cooperating with all parties “who have the goodwill to serve our country with their work.” Frick had promised to swear an oath to the constitution and also declared that he would drop his accusations of corruption against Stresemann. A firewall on the political right was out of the question for the Thuringian DVP. On the contrary, Witzmann said, the National Socialists were “ideologically and politically closer” to the DVP than the Social Democrats were. In the end, the government was confirmed by 28 votes to 22 from the SPD, KPD, and DDP. Frick became the first National Socialist minister of a regional German government. The fact that Weimar of all places—­the Thuringian capital, in which Germany had adopted its democratic constitution—­served as a springboard to elevate the National Socialists to an important position of power was not a coincidence. After the interlude of the Thuringian united-­front leftist government of the SPD and KPD in the fall of 1923, which ended with the Reich intervening there and in Saxony, the Right had begun to gain strength. The “Thuringian Order League”—­a conglomeration of the DNVP, DVP, and Thuringian Rural League—­emerged as the strongest force in the state elections on February 10, 1924. However, with thirty-­five of seventy-­two state parliamentary seats, it fell short of a majority and therefore had to rely on being tolerant of the Popular-­Ethnic Social Bloc, a successor organization to the then-­banned Nazi Party, which surprised everyone by winning 9.3 percent of the vote and seven parliamentary seats. In the city of Weimar itself, it had even received almost twice as many votes, with 18.6 percent. One of the new government’s first measures was to cut funding for Walter Gropius’s unpopular Bauhaus in Weimar. In response, the director and the “masters,” as the instructors were known, declared their contracts with the state of Thuringia null and void. The world-­famous architecture and art school found a new home in Dessau, the capital of the regional state of Anhalt. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. It was the minister of the interior in this conservative–­extreme right government who in February 1925, after the reestablishment of the Nazi Party, lifted a nationwide ban on Hitler speaking publicly. Gradually, Thuringia replaced Bavaria as the primary stomping ground for the Far Right. “Nowhere in Germany did Hitler, the Nazis, the racist antisemites, the military associations, and extreme nationalists find a better place for their activities,” historian Karsten Rudolph has concluded. In March 1925, Hitler gave his first speeches in Weimar at several packed events. Further appearances followed in October 1925. When in the city, the party leader preferred to stay at the Hotel Elephant, the traditional hotel on the market square, which rolled out the red carpet early on. The hospitality he received was one reason that, after the ban on him speaking was rescinded, Hitler decided to convene the NSDAP’s first Reich Party Conference in early July 1926 in Weimar. In contrast to previous quarrels within the far-­right ethnic nationalist movement, the Nazi Party presented a new unity, tightly focused on the “Führer” as the undisputed integrating leader. On the afternoon of July 4, Hitler was allowed to speak at the Deutsches Nationaltheater—­the same venue where Friedrich Ebert had opened the National Assembly on February 6, 1919, and where the National Constituent Assembly had met. “Where Ebert once sat, today Adolf Hitler sits and stands,” boasted the gauleiter, or Nazi regional leader, Arthur Dinter, at a “general roll call” of the SA (Sturmabteilung) and SS. “This is the beginning of a new era.” In September 1927, Hitler dismissed Dinter, who was also the author of the antisemitic bestseller Die Sünde wider das Blut (The sin against blood), from his post because his sectarian idea of restoring the “pure doctrine of salvation” was upsetting people in the party leader’s circles. As his replacement, Hitler appointed the former managing director Fritz Sauckel, an unconditional true believer who would enjoy a long career. It was also in the Weimar Nazi Party administration that an inconspicuous functionary began a career as a cashier and accountant, which would see him become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. His name was Martin Bormann. Likewise, the young Baldur von Schirach, a son of the last grand-­ducal theater director, also found his way to Hitler in Weimar. He wrote verses of homage to the Führer, who would later, in October 1931, appoint him Reich Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. Along with the racist literary historian and avowed antisemite Adolf Bartels and his pupil Hans Severus Ziegler, deputy gauleiter since 1925, it was Schirach who gave Hitler access to conservative, upper-­middle-­class circles in the city. “I love Weimar,” Hitler proclaimed in 1928. “I need Weimar like I need Bayreuth. And the day will come when I’ll give this city and its theater a lot more support. I still have big plans for Weimar and Bayreuth.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. The Nazis took 11.3 percent of the vote in the Thuringian state elections on December 8, 1929. This was more than three times as much as in the regional elections in February 1927 (3.5 percent). In Weimar, they got no less than 23.8 percent. Their success wasn’t accidental. Under Sauckel’s leadership, the party had built up a powerful machine and had aggressively campaigned and stirred up unrest in small rural Thuringian communities. Its success came primarily at the expense of the mainstream parties—­a sign of how voter behavior was shifting and a harbinger of the coming landslide in the Reichstag elections of September 14, 1930. The Berliner Tageblatt was thus very wrong when it dismissed the result as “a fad surrounded by carnival hype that has to be tolerated.” Although the Nazis won only six seats in the regional parliament, they were still in a key position. As in 1924, the mainstream parties of the center and right lacked a majority. Their twenty-­three seats (Rural Association: nine; Business Party: six; DVP: five; DNVP: two; DDP: one) were outweighed by the twenty-­four seats for the SPD (eighteen) and the KPD (six). Since they had ruled out a coalition with the Social Democrats, they needed the support of the six National Socialist MPs to form a government. This time around, Hitler did not want merely to tolerate a coalition. On the contrary, from the very outset, he wanted to be part of the government. Hitler was unusually frank about his motives in a letter, dated February 2, 1930, to a supporter of the Nazi movement living overseas, in which he noted a “great turnaround” in the public perception of Nazism. It was “astonishing how the knee-­jerk, arrogant, snobbish, or stupid rejection of the party of just a few years ago has given way to expectations and hope.” However, he added, such hope would be disappointed if they were to remain in the opposition out of principle. But in return for the party’s participating in coalition negotiations, Hitler demanded two key posts, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of National Education. “The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the entire administration, the personnel department, that is, the appointment and dismissal of all civil servants and the police. The Ministry of Public Education is responsible for the entire school system, from elementary schools to the University of Jena, as well as the theater system. Whoever is in possession of these two ministries and uses his power ruthlessly and persistently can achieve extraordinary things.” Hitler was thus interested not only in participating in government but in taking over the executive from within. “We will pass the first test of our mettle,” predicted Berlin gauleiter and later Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels on January 8, 1930. Hitler added that “only a National Socialist through and through with both great expertise and unconditional National Socialist convictions” could be considered as a candidate to take over the dual ministry. Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler believed he had found the right person in Frick, an early party supporter, the former head of the political division in the Munich police headquarters, and the acting chairman of the Nazi parliamentary group in the Reichstag, calling him “an energetic, bold, and responsible civil servant of extraordinary ability and a fanatical National Socialist!” Initially, the DVP rejected the ministerial appointment of someone who had taken part in the 1923 putsch and been convicted of high treason. “So I went to Weimar myself,” Hitler reported in the letter on February 2, “and succinctly assured the gentlemen in no uncertain terms that either Dr. Frick would become our minister, or fresh elections would be held.” Fresh elections were the last thing the mainstream parties wanted, since they were sure to further strengthen the Nazi Party. Hitler gave his prospective mainstream parties a deadline of three days, from January 10 to 13. Otherwise, he would have a motion introduced to dissolve the regional parliament. But the DVP still had its scruples. Hitler was in a strong bargaining position, however, and he furthered his cause with a speech to leading representatives of Thuringia’s business and industry associations on January 10, which made a huge impression. “In the evening, Hitler spoke to a closed circle,” a very satisfied Goebbels noted. “In front of 150 bigwigs, reeking of respectability. Hitler spoke fabulously. I’ve rarely heard him that good.” Business circles were also ramping up pressure on the DVP, and when the ultimatum expired, the party caved in. On January 23, 1930, the coalition government was confirmed in office. “Frick is now a minister in Weimar,” Goebbels recorded in his diary. “It was a difficult birth.” Frick’s party comrade Wilhelm Marschler was appointed state councillor, a position that gave him a vote in the cabinet. There was no lack of warning voices in the DVP. “It hurts my soul to see you in such company,” shouted DVP Reichstag deputy Siegfried von Kardorff to the delegates from Thuringia at the party’s conference in Mannheim in March 1930. But the fact that the DVP was doing deals with the Nazis at all showed how far the party had drifted to the right under Stresemann’s successor, Ernst Scholz. Making common cause with the National Socialists at regional level while being part of a grand coalition with the Social Democrats at Reich level was a complete contradiction. In that respect, the Thuringian experiment already foreshadowed the imminent demise of Hermann Müller’s government. Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Minister Frick did not disappoint expectations. At the third reading of the laws to enact the Young Plan in the Reichstag on March 12, 1930, he took a seat on the benches of the state representatives and made a statement of vigorous protest immediately before the final vote, railing against the “Enslavement Act,” the adoption of which would bring “the greatest national misfortune and end the independence of Germany’s regional states.” The Thuringian Ministry of State had not authorized him to make this statement. Although the DVP parliamentary group leader, Witzmann, disapproved of his unilateral action a few days later, Frick faced no consequences. Hitler had set his party colleague two tasks. As Thuringian minister of the interior, Frick was to “carry out a slow purge of the administrative and civil service from all red revolutionary elements.” There was “a great deal to do,” Hitler said, especially in policing. And as minister of national education, he was to push ahead with the “nationalization of the school system.” Hitler demanded, “In the same vein, we will purge the teaching staff of Marxist-­democratic elements just as we will adapt the curriculum to our National Socialist beliefs and ideas.” Frick set to work with great energy to remake Thuringia in this sense. In his inaugural speech to the civil servants in his two ministries, he made it clear that a “new spirit” now applied in Weimar, and that it would be fundamentally different from the “treacherous November spirit” of the German republic. On March 18, 1930, he introduced to the state parliament the draft of an enabling act intended to largely free the state government from parliamentary control for six months. The law was passed by a simple majority (28 votes to 25) on March 29. Under the guise of reforming and streamlining the administration, civil servants loyal to the republic were dismissed and replaced by followers of the NSDAP. The Reich government, however, did not stand idly by as Frick went about doing what he did. On March 18, 1930, the Social Democratic Minister of the Interior Carl Severing informed the Thuringian government that he had received news “giving rise to justified doubts as to whether the conditions for the granting of a Reich subsidy for police purposes” were still fulfilled. Thuringian State Premier Erwin Baum from the Rural League “solemnly appealed” to the Reich not to block the funds. The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Although the new minister of the interior, Joseph Wirth of the Center Party, who had been in office since March 30, 1930, reached an agreement with the Thuringian state government in April to lift the ban on the Reich subsidy, no agreement was reached on the fundamental question of whether National Socialists should be allowed to join the police force. Frick created a fait accompli by filling the offices of the police directorates of Weimar and Gera with his allies. When Wirth then had police funds blocked again in June 1930, Baum filed a complaint with the State Court in Leipzig. The conflict between Thuringia and the Reich was settled in December 1930, when the former guaranteed the “nonpolitical conduct of individual civil servants without fail while on duty” and the latter agreed to lift the freeze on police subsidies. Frick was unperturbed by all the objections from Berlin and continued his policy of “cleansing” the civil service. Goebbels, who visited him in Weimar at the beginning of June 1930, was impressed: “He is in good spirits, has the courage of his convictions, provokes people, and behaves insolently toward the bigwigs in Berlin. A true German minister indeed.” Civil servants who were members of or close to the SPD were hit particularly hard by the staff cuts the state of Thuringia also had to make due to the precarious financial situation. Frick appointed three of his party comrades to the Ministry of Education, including the deputy gauleiter Hans Severus Ziegler, as “expert advisers.” They acted as a kind of shadow government, with access to personnel files, which they used to tar-­brush undesirables among the teaching ranks. Suspicion and denunciation became pervasive in the Thuringian administration. Parallel to his administrative and personnel purges, Frick set about to radically change the country’s cultural policy. On April 16, 1930, school prayers were reintroduced by a decree in the official gazette of the Ministry of National Education. The reason given was that “forces alien to the species and people” had long been trying to “destroy the spiritual, moral, and religious foundations of our German thinking and feeling in order to uproot the German people and thus make it easier to control us,” the decree stated. The German people could resist these pernicious influences only “if they kept the religious and moral driving forces of their nature pure and passed them on to the next generations of youth.” Three of the suggested prayers were clearly directed against the democratic constitutional order of the Weimar Republic, which was viewed as anathema to the spirit of ethnic jingoism. The second of these rhyming prayers went: Father, in your almighty hand Stand our people and fatherland You were our ancestors’ honor and strength You are our constant weapon and defense Therefore free us from betrayal and deceit Make us strong for the liberating deed Give us the Savior’s heroic bravery Let honor and freedom be our highest commodity! Let our vow and watchword be: Germany, awaken! Lord, make us free! May God make it so! The Nazi battle cry “Germany awaken” was intended to instill nationalism in schoolchildren. Frick left no doubt as to who was meant by the “forces alien to the species and people” in the state parliament in May 1930. The “prayers for freedom,” he explained, were intended to serve as a “defense against the fraud” that had been “committed against the German people by Marxism and the Jews.” The Nazis’ coalition partners offered little opposition to the mandatory bastardized school prayers, and protests from the Thuringian Teachers’ Association and the Protestant regional church were also limited. Conversely, the coalition parties shot down a motion by the SPD parliamentary group to rescind the decree. Frick did, however, lose a lawsuit filed with the Leipzig State Court. In its ruling of July 11, 1930, three particularly offensive prayers were rejected because they impinged on the “sensibilities of dissenters” and thus violated Article 148, paragraph 2, of the Reich Constitution. Before that, in February 1930, Frick had issued an injunction against Erich Maria Remarque’s famous anti-­war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, which had been published in spring 1929 and quickly become a bestseller. School boards in Thuringia were instructed to report which schools had purchased the title and which teachers had used the book in class. Further inclusion of the book in reading lists was prohibited. These regulations were in line with the views of the German Fighting League for German Culture, which had been founded in August 1927 under the leadership of the Nazi Party’s chief ideologue, Alfred Rosenberg. At its Whitsunday conference in Weimar in 1930, held under Frick’s patronage, the league demanded that the “German will to self-­defense must be hardened.” Nazi cultural watchdogs considered Remarque’s bestseller capable of impairing that “will.” The same strictures also applied to the film version of the novel. The Nazi Party, led by Goebbels as the gauleiter of the German capital, railed against the film, which premiered in Berlin in December 1930, and on December 11, the Supreme Film Board gave in to SA intimidation and banned it. “The Nazi street fighter is dictating the government’s actions,” crowed Hitler’s propaganda expert. Frick’s next serious intervention in cultural life came at the beginning of April 1930 with the decree “Against Negro Culture and for German Ethnic Identity.” In its preamble, it claimed that for years, “foreign racial influences,” capable of “undermining the moral fortitude of the German people,” had been “increasingly asserting themselves in almost all cultural areas.” It was therefore “in the interest of the preservation and strengthening of the German ethnic identity” that everything “glorifying Negroism” should be seen as “signs of decay” to be “prevented as much as possible.” The authorities were to apply the “strictest standards” and punish all theater companies that could not be regarded as “morally or artistically reliable.” This decree provided the basis for numerous bans. For example, the performance of Friedrich Wolf’s abortion drama, Cyanide, which Erwin Piscator’s Berliner Ensemble wanted to stage in Gera and Jena, was prohibited. Plays by the expressionists Ernst Toller and Walter Hasenclever also disappeared from the repertoire of state theaters. On May 22, 1930, SPD member of parliament Max Greil, a former minister of popular education, excoriated Frick in front of the Thuringian state parliament, castigating him for trying to politicize all areas of cultural life “along the lines of National Socialist Party beliefs.” Frick’s “proclamation against Negro culture,” Greil argued, was actually directed against Jews, and he demanded that Frick publicly acknowledge this fact. Contrasting Nazi cultural policy with the “classical spirit of cosmopolitanism in the sense of Goethe,” Greil said, “It is the spirit of nationalist narrow-­mindedness; it is the spirit of chauvinist warmongering.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. In his infamous decree, Frick had announced that he had appointed the architect Paul Schultze-­Naumburg as the new director of the Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten (College of Architecture, Fine Arts, and Crafts) in Weimar and that it was to be developed into a “center of German culture.” Schultze-­Naumburg, whom Frick had also hired as an “art consultant,” had made a name for himself as a vehement opponent of the Bauhaus and advocate of a “racially sound” German culture. His house in Saaleck near Bad Kösen, located below the castle ruins, was a popular meeting place for extreme right-­wing nationalist circles. In June 1930, Goebbels was a guest there. He was accompanied by Frick and Walther Darré, later the Nazi food minister. “The Schultze house is beautifully situated above the Saale River, wonderfully blended into the landscape, a true gem,” noted Goebbels in his diary. “I have never seen such a stylish house.” While in the town, the Berlin gauleiter did not neglect to visit the graves of Fischer and Kern, the men who had murdered Walther Rathenau. In his speech inaugurating the newly designed Vereinigte Kunstlehranstalten on November 10, 1930, Schultze-­Naumburg raged against modern art, which, he claimed, consisted “only of obscure, tortured, and distorted images and the visualization of mental and physical inferiority.” He was united with Germany’s youth, he added, in the goal of “chasing all those corrupters of and traitors to the people out of the German house, in which they have no place.” Deeds followed these words. That October, Schultze-­Naumburg had wall frescoes by Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer painted over in the Van de Velde building. In early November, at Frick’s behest, seventy works by modern artists, including paintings and drawings by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, were removed from the exhibition rooms of the Weimar Palace Museum. Frick justified this preview of the Nazis’ infamous 1937 campaign against “degenerate art” by claiming that the ostracized works had “nothing in common with Nordic-­German nature” and only “depicted eastern and other inferior subhumanity.” There was hardly any resistance in Weimar to this “storming of paintings,” as it became known. But the liberal Berlin press, including the Berliner Tageblatt, branded it for what it was: “a scandal in a cultured nation.” But even this scandal was surpassed by Frick’s most audacious coup: the appointment of the racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther as a professor at the University of Jena. In doing so, Frick was acting on Hitler’s expectations in a letter of February 2, 1930, in which the Nazi leader had envisaged the “establishment of a chair for racial issues and racial studies” in Jena as the “first step” in the desired “intellectual upheaval.” Hitler himself had suggested Günther, the author of a “racial primer of the German people,” for the position. When the university rector, church historian Karl Heussi, opposed Frick’s request, the students’ association, already dominated by National Socialist sympathizers, rebelled. Frick praised the Jena student body for having shown “more understanding for the need to create the conditions necessary for Germany’s renewal” than the professors. The only concession made to the university’s teaching staff was that the original title—­Chair of Human Civilization—­was changed to Chair of Social Anthropology. Hitler personally attended Günther’s inaugural lecture, on November 15, 1930, which was entitled “The Causes of the Racial Decline of the German People Since the Migration of Peoples.” On April 1, 1931, Frick’s time in government in Thuringia came to an abrupt end, after the DVP joined a motion of no confidence proposed by the Social Democrats and Communists. Yet it was not Frick’s actions as a minister that caused the coalition to break up, but rather the insulting remarks made by Gauleiter Sauckel in an editorial in the party newspaper Der Nationalsozialist (The National Socialist). After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. In it, Sauckel had belittled representatives of the DVP as “foolish old men, traitors, and swindlers,” who “in their bottomless impudence were playing a sacrilegious game with the fate of our people.” This proved too much even for a party that had endured months of Frick’s provocations. Amid considerable press attention, Hitler had traveled to Weimar the day before the vote to try to change the DVP’s mind, but his trip was in vain. In the parliamentary debate preceding the no-­confidence motion on April 1, Philipp Kallenbach of the DDP described the results of Frick’s fourteen months in government as “downright disastrous.” Kallenbach said: “Peace in our state has been destroyed. The driving force behind these administrative measures is the desire to stir up people and create a spectacle, even to encourage hatred and take one-­sided actions against broad segments of the population. To a great extent in the short time in question, all areas of public life have been politicized in the interests of the Nazi Party. To advance those ends, personnel policy has been ruthless, with allies being permitted to feed at the trough more openly and self-­evidently than ever before.” After Frick resigned in the run-­up to the Reich presidential election in spring of 1932, it became known that he had secretly attempted to obtain German citizenship for Hitler. The affair caused a sensation. A parliamentary inquiry, chaired by SPD politician Hermann Brill, was formed in Weimar to investigate, and Hitler and Frick were summoned as witnesses. The picture that emerged started in the summer of 1930. With State Premier Baum away on vacation, Frick had sought to lay the groundwork for Hitler’s naturalization by appointing him gendarmerie commissioner in the town of Hildburghausen, while at the same time releasing him from all duties as a civil servant. Two ministry officials were ordered to initiate the necessary formalities under “strictest official secrecy.” The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. At a regional Nazi meeting in Gera on July 12, 1930, Frick presented Hitler with the certificate of appointment, and he confirmed receipt with his signature. Afterward, however, the Nazi leader apparently had second thoughts, worrying that the title of gendarmerie commissioner might make him look ridiculous. In any case, he tore up the document a few days later in Munich. Before the committee of inquiry, he testified that he had not wanted to accept the appointment in the first place. The grotesque story of Frick’s attempted naturalization of Hitler quickly became the talk of the town. “Lots of hounding in the press,” an annoyed Goebbels noted. “Crazy caricatures.” The affair was mocked as a “presumptuous masquerade” and a “prank.” But an editorial in the liberal Vossische Zeitung drew attention to the deadly serious underlying meaning. With his “unsuccessful push” to make Hitler a German, Frick had once again proved that the National Socialists were unwilling to abide by the law. “It would be good if the true character of this party were finally recognized outside Bavaria, where people have experienced it up close,” the paper wrote. In Thuringia, no one heeded the warning. In the state elections in late July 1932, the NSDAP emerged as the strongest party, with 42.5 percent of the vote, and Sauckel became state premier. Looking back, the Social Democratic politician, journalist, and later member of the anti-­Nazi resistance Hermann Brill described the “Frick era” in Thuringia as “one of the most important vanguard skirmishes in the great battle between democracy and dictatorship.” Indeed, during his time in office, Frick delivered a foretaste of what could be expected if the National Socialists came to power nationally. For fourteen months, Thuringia served as a laboratory in which they could try out measures they were to implement on a larger scale at Reich level three years later. In a personal letter dated April 2, 1931, Hitler thanked Frick for “placing Thuringia at the center of Germany’s national, political, and economic redevelopment.” The Nazi leader added, “We all firmly believe in the hour that will once again, this time forever, call you to serve our people in a responsible position.” And Frick was in fact rewarded with the post of Reich minister of the interior—­one of the most powerful positions in the land—­in the “cabinet of national concentration” formed on January 30, 1933, under Germany’s new chancellor, Hitler. __________________________________ Excerpted from Fateful Hours: The Collapse of the Weimar Republic.

Title: Google union organizer on AI job impact, working conditions

AI advocates typically respond to concerns about job loss with reassurances that AI will ultimately create more jobs. They also assert that if AI displaces jobs, organizations will upskill workers for new, more valuable jobs or train them enough on AI to remain employable in the AI-driven workplace of the future. That case faced setbacks in the past two months as evidence mounted that AI is already destroying jobs. Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 corporate workers so it can be more nimble. The cuts weren't portrayed as directly resulting from AI, but in June, CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon's workforce would shrink as the company embraces AI. Target and UPS announced similar layoffs. But the reductions most explicitly caused by AI were at software vendors, including Salesforce, which said in September it would cut 4,000 customer support jobs. Earlier in the year, CEO Marc Benioff said AI was already doing nearly half the work in the department. The loudest voices on AI's impact on jobs tend to be executives at vendors that make AI software or their biggest customers. Skeptics are harder to find. In this episode of Enterprise Apps Unpacked, Shannon Wait, a senior organizer at the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), discusses the issue from the tech worker's point of view. Her job has mostly involved advocating for the rights of the workers who labor behind the scenes to make AI possible, which she details in the podcast. She also explains how those same workers are increasingly worried about losing their jobs to automation through AI. "When people think about AI, they think innovation and curing cancer," Wait said. "We're going to move America into a new age and try to beat China in this race. Those are the talking points, when in reality the talking points should be the layoffs and job losses. We're streamlining shopping through ChatGPT instead of curing cancer." Wait made international news in 2021 when the AWU, part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), filed an unfair labor practices action on her behalf against Alphabet, Google's parent company, and Modis, the contractor that had employed her since 2019 at a Google data center in South Carolina. Wait noticed the pay and advancement opportunities of contractors weren't comparable to those of Google employees at the same facility. Nor were the working conditions. The contract workers' jobs involved difficult physical labor, such as swapping out server hard drives and heavy batteries in hot data centers that could hit 85 degrees. After a series of unmet promises, minimal responses to complaints about unfit conditions and other disappointments from her employer, Wait accidentally broke her company-issued water bottle and was refused a replacement. It was the last straw. She complained and was escorted out of the building. So she immediately invited coworkers to join the AWU but was suspended with pay. The union action succeeded, Google and Modis settled, and Wait was back at work within two weeks. Her victory garnered widespread press coverage. The BBC posted an article on its website titled "The woman who took on Google and won." Google, which the workers had accused of discouraging unionization, signed a document saying employees had the right to discuss pay and working conditions. Since then, Wait has been a full-time advocate for the union. Much of her work has focused on the plight of raters, whose job is to evaluate the quality as well as the accuracy of webpages and search results to help improve Google's algorithms and AI. In a recent survey, some raters said they know they're training new AI that is meant to replace them. Some have been subjected to automatic suspension by "robo-bosses" for not meeting certain quotas and must go through a long process with a human to get reinstated. "You would think that these companies would want the people working on AI to have feedback on how to do better and be given clear metrics on how to make these tools safer and easier to use," Wait said. "Instead, you're just an outlier -- you're suspended -- hope you get re-onboarded at some point in the future. I just don't think that's a good way to do business in any part of the world." Wait volunteers as policy advisor for the TechEquity collaborative, which partnered this year with the AWU-CWA to publish a report titled "Ghost workers in the AI machine: U.S. data workers speak out about big tech's exploitation," which surveyed raters and other workers in behind-the-scenes roles at AI providers. Other topics discussed in the podcast include the following: David Essex is an industry editor who covers enterprise applications, emerging technology and market trends, and creates in-depth content for several TechTarget websites.

Title: Amazon’s LORD OF THE RING MMORPG Reportedly Cancelled After Massive Layoffs

Full Content:
For fans dreaming of returning to Middle-earth in a new, next-gen adventure, the news isn’t good. Amazon’s ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which had been in development since early 2023, has reportedly been cancelled. The project was meant to bring players back into Tolkien’s world with a fresh, modern spin, but development apparently stopped in October 2025. The report comes from Bloomberg, which revealed that Amazon began cutting roughly 14,000 jobs across the company in late October. Among those affected were many employees from Amazon Games, the publisher behind the long-awaited Lord of the Rings MMO. The cuts hit multiple divisions, but one key detail came from Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer, who confirmed on LinkedIn that she was among those laid off—and that the Middle-earth project was shelved. Amrine shared a bittersweet note: “Y’all would have loved it.” Amazon Games has been around since 2012, focusing primarily on publishing original titles. That focus seems to be shifting. In a memo released on October 28, 2025, the company cited “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games and outlined plans to concentrate more on its cloud gaming platform, Luna. The service primarily hosts existing titles, meaning fewer in-house game developments like the cancelled Lord of the Rings MMORPG. Despite the major shakeup, Amazon Games will continue work on March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider title, and other “casual and AI-focused games.” Still, losing such a massive and promising project sucks, not just for Amazon’s team, but for fans of Tolkien’s world who’ve been waiting for a new multiplayer experience since The Lord of the Rings Online launched back in 2007. That game, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, remains beloved but very dated by today’s standards. The cancelled MMO could have been the perfect way to bring players back to a living, breathing Middle-earth with updated visuals, gameplay, and storytelling inspired by The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings novels. The cancellation is a lost opportunity for synergy. With Amazon already heavily invested in Tolkien’s universe through The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the MMORPG could have expanded on that world, offering fans a chance to explore events from before the Third Age—when Sauron’s power still loomed large and the One Ring had yet to be destroyed in Mount Doom. Unfortunately, that vision won’t be realized anytime soon. While there are still plenty of older Lord of the Rings games to revisit, it may be a long wait before another studio takes up the challenge of creating a new MMORPG set in Middle-earth. For now, it’s a somber end to what could have been a truly epic return to one of fantasy’s most iconic worlds.

Title: AI Companies Are Treating Their Workers Like Human Garbage, Which May Be a Sign of Things to Come for the Rest of Us

Time Published: 2025-11-16T14:00:00Z

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 16, 2025 9:00 AM EST In today’s economy, tech companies are red hot. In fact, the companies burning cash on AI seem to be some of the only ones having a truly great time, as the corporate rate of profit plummets throughout the US and recession fears loom. Though one economist estimates tech companies accounted for 92 percent of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025, you wouldn’t know it by looking at their staff rosters — which seem to be plummeting at an alarming rate. Amazon, for example, recently laid off 14,000 corporate employees, despite posting billions in profits across numerous lines of business. Across the month of October, tech workers made up the highest number of layoffs in any industry, leading the charge in one of the worst single months for furloughs since 2003. That’s bad news, of course, but it also directly contradicts the AI industry’s promises of — in the words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — ushering in “a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet.” Sadly, as Business Insider reports, the bloodbath is far from over. On Tuesday, the AI grading company Mercor — which has massive contracts with corporations like OpenAI and Anthropic — suddenly announced it was shuttering a huge project with Meta, leaving workers scrambling. The Meta Project, called Musen, employed some 5,000 data labelers at its peak, and was previously expected to last until at least 2026, according to BI. “They kept stressing how happy the client was and how it got extended until the end of the year,” one contractor told the publication. “So to then do this major switch up before the holidays took everyone by surprise.” Luckily for those workers, Mercor is offering to hire them back — just not for Musen. Instead, they’ll have the opportunity work on an extremely similar project named “Nova.” The main difference, it seems, is the wage offered: while Musen’s base contract was $21 an hour, Nova’s opens at $16. Two tech workers offered a Nova contract said the offer email explained the difference in pay is due to “steadier task volumes across multimedia content” and “higher hour caps, enabling greater weekly engagement.” In other words, data labelers — who already had a bum deal as stable jobs become temporary contract work — get to work more for less pay. One employee who accepted a contract to work on Nova told BI the work is functionally the same, “but for $5 less an hour.” “It sounds like most of us are in the same boat,” the worker added. “We wanted to boycott this but are not in a financial place to do so. We needed to have the guaranteed income, even if it’s demoralizing.” The whole episode underscores the false promises beneath the AI boom: jobs are being degraded, the number of “freelance workers” is soaring, AI-generated profit is almost nonexistent, and rising tides on Wall Street certainly aren’t raising all boats. If this is how the most powerful companies in the world are treating workers now, why would the AI “utopia,” as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it, be any different? What’s more, if the companies on the cutting edge of a supposed “technological revolution” can’t be expected to take care of their employees, what hope do the rest of us have?

Title: How laid-off Amazon workers are coping with the shock and planning their next career moves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, "It's about culture." Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate — only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs — and the tough job market — are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well — I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised — but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off.

Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses — mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my résumé. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though — I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, "Why me?" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to
