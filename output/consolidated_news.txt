In what is being seen as one of the largest internal protest at a tech firm, more than 1,000 employees have signed an open letter warning against the impact of the company's strong AI push. The letter, reviewed by The Guardian, points out AI's triple threat to employment, democracy and climate. Staff from across tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft have backed the letter and engineers, product managers and warehouse workers from Amazon are among the signatories. The letter comes in the backdrop of layoffs made by Amazon as part of its AI expansion plan through scaling up the use of artificial intelligence tools across operations; in turn, prompting questions around crucial topics like job security, workplace surveillance and environmental impact. The layoff announcements in recent period have been seen through the prism of multibillion-dollar commitments for new AI-linked data centres in the US along with rapid AI automations. This is something which has compounded fears of further job cuts, on top of an already mounting pressures related to higher productivity quotas. A senior software engineer was quoted by The Guardian as saying that employees are feeling the pressure to use AI tools for coding and writing, and underscored that management now expects "twice as much work because of AI tools". Another worker highlighted that the use of AI tools is being used as a justification for random productivity quotas despite the tools not bridging the gap. The worker-led initiative also calls upon Amazon to ensure that its data centres run on clean energy so as not to deteriorate the climate situation further. Moreover, it also demands restricting AI products that could encourage and enable "violence, surveillance and mass deportation", and creation of worker-led bodies to oversee how AI is deployed internally. The protest at one of the world’s largest technology companies has become a symbol of growing internal distress among workers along with their resistance to generative AI is reshaping workflows and power dynamics.

Title: Elegant cocktail watches, a Kashmir sapphire ring and a tiara that turns into a necklace

As purchases of jewellery and watches peak at this time of the year, auctioneers have been busy selecting antique pieces for their pre-Christmas auctions. But, before we go there, it’s interesting to note how Courtville Antiques is drawing in potential customers by offering classes in the history of jewellery design. “There are classes on how to make jewellery, or how to grade gemstones, but we are keen to run courses looking at how jewellery styles evolved through historic fashion icons and how jewellery featured in portrait paintings,” explains Matthew Weldon, owner of Courtville Gallery in Dublin’s Powerscourt Townhouse Centre. This columnist was one of the 42 attendees last week at the pilot courses, which Weldon hopes to develop through Courtville Academy in 2026. Each two-hour class offered a whistle-stop tour through the jewellery styles from Victorian to Art Deco and Art Nouveau to Edwardian eras. For instance, did you know that Victorian jewellery often had a secret language coded into the design of the piece? A brooch with consecutive ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, ruby and diamond stones spells regard, indicating the esteem the giver held for the recipient. During the suffragette movement, a brooch with stones in green and violet had the hidden meaning “give votes to women”. And did you know that the introduction of platinum in Edwardian times enabled jewellery designers to create more delicate, yet still strong necklaces, brooches and rings? In the classes, Paris-based jewellery historian Véronique Goguen, and Courtville’s jewellery historian, Efthymia Sigkoudi, explained the historical context of jewellery designs, while participants tested their new knowledge to identify brooches, necklaces, rings and bracelets from the different periods. But back to the auctions: Adam’s Fine Jewellery and Ladies’ Watches auction on Tuesday December 2nd has an intriguing collection of watches from the late 1800s through to the 1970s. This single-owner collection offers us another short history lesson in the origins of wristwatches, worn more by women initially than men. From the late 1800s onwards, robust wrist watches became more practical than pocket watches for men at war planning synchronised battle attacks. And it was a Brazilian pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont, who first commissioned his friend, French watchmaker Louis Cartier, to design a wristwatch for him for use during flying. In contrast, ladies’ watches were first designed as bracelets – often with the watch itself concealed in the design. The 1940s Vacheron & Constantin retro secret bracelet watch (€8,000-€12,000) is one example of this style, as is the Kutchinsky Jaeger-LeCoultre cocktail bracelet with its tiny watch hidden inside a shell-like shield (€6,000-€8,000). The Cartier Art Deco-style pearl, diamond and onyx cocktail watch (€12,000-€18,000) is a more subtly stylish watch, also for sale as part of this single-owner collection. Adam’s director of jewellery, Claire Mestrallet, is also very excited by the inclusion of another Kashmir sapphire in a sapphire and diamond ring (€100,000-€150,000). It is for sale on behalf of a member of the Guerlain family, owners of the famous French perfume house. This will be the fourth Kashmir sapphire for sale at Adam’s in 2025; the first sold for a record €660,000 in May, and another two Kashmir sapphire brooches sold in September for €1.36 million. Kashmir sapphires are particularly valuable, because they were excavated from a small mine in the Indian province for only about five years in the 1880s. Mestrallet says that each Kashmir sapphire has been a “discovery”. When she suspected she had another Kashmir sapphire set in to a ring by French jeweller Boucheron, her fellow directors and even the laboratory technicians doubted her instincts. “When the lady brought me in her jewellery for sale, I thought it was a Kashmir sapphire, but I didn’t say anything. I told the directors we should have it tested and they laughed at me,” explains Mestrallet. However, her instincts were correct and she now expects potential international buyers to arrive in Dublin to view the ring. “I had people flying in from India, Hong Kong and Australia for the earlier auctions with Kashmir sapphires,” she says. A late 19th-century diamond tiara, which converts to a necklace (€5,000-€7,000), is another exquisitely made piece. Adam’s is also holding an auction of men’s watches on December 3rd, with highlights including an extremely rare Longines Sommatore chronograph wristwatch (€40,000-€80,000) and a Rolex Submariner Date (€10,000-€15,000). Meanwhile, Adams of Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery and watches auction, which ends on December 3rd. With a wide variety of rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets, with estimates starting from around €150-€450, this auction has many pieces that would make for more affordable Christmas presents. There is also a good range of antique watches, including a Cartier Panthère de Cartier (€1,200-€1,400), and an 18-carat gold nurse’s brooch/watch (€350-€450). More unusually, the auction also has a kimono-style dress worn by the late Irish singer Sínead O’Connor, designed by Joanne Hayes (€600-€800). Designer handbags also feature, including a black Chanel quilted flap bag (€1,800 – €2,000) and a Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag in damier azur canvas (€500-€600). Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: €6,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200,000-€300,000 Hammer price: €340,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €14,000-€18,000 Hammer price: €26,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €3,000-€5,000 Hammer price: €4,000 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

More Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 1 this year, which means it’s officially tomorrow. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales are already live across the biggest retailers. Almost all major retailers offer tons of deals and discounts for Cyber Monday. Think of companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as more specialized retailers such as B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can also run out of stock, so there are pros and cons to shopping in‑store and online. Cyber Monday sales are running right now. Many retailers launched their deals earlier this week, and although Black Friday is behind us, plenty of fresh discounts are rolling in for Cyber Monday. With Cyber Week starting tomorrow, you’ll have more time to enjoy the savings from both events. Many CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s certainly possible that tariffs could affect pricing, as we’ve seen some related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. You can do this on sites like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or by using the Keepa browser extension. We’ve rounded up several useful shopping tools for you to check out, and we’ll highlight the best deals we find throughout the event. Generally speaking, no. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and deals that exist both in person and online. Cyber Monday started off as an online alternative to Black Friday. But as more shopping is done online, the two events have started to blend together. That doesn’t mean all the deals are the same, but it does mean that finding new deals has become a greater challenge. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to refer to the practice of workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to move to the term “Big Friday” failed, merchants attempted to ameliorate the term Black Friday in subsequent years, suggesting that its origin was not due to the terrible traffic the shopping spree created, but because the profit it generated put stores “back in the black” in financial terms. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” because it had noticed a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed it was because people were making online purchases while at work following the holiday, so their kids couldn’t see any gift purchases and because work computers typically had faster internet connections. There was some chatter about calling the date Black Monday or Blue Monday -- because hyperlinks are blue -- but eventually, everyone settled on the more futuristic‑sounding Cyber Monday. In 2014, Cyber Monday became the biggest online shopping day in the country.

Title: Will LIC Stand Firm Or Will It Bend Against External Influence?
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/will-lic-stand-firm-or-will-it-bend-against-external-influence
Time Published: 2025-11-29T12:14:40Z

There is growing noise around LIC’s investments, with some groups targeting it along with groups like Adani and Reliance, calling them “risky.” This is an attempt to influence LIC’s decisions through media and social media pressure. Between 2010 and 2013, similar campaigns targeting India’s coal, energy and power and defence sectors led to a policy paralysis resulting in economic failures and large NPAs in public sector banks. Stocks like Coal India, NTPC, ONGC, BHEL, and Hindustan Aeronautics faced stalled decisions due to external pressure. If LIC hesitates due to public pressure or selective criticism, it could delay vital long-term investments in India’s infrastructure and capital markets, harming the country’s financial stability. Its important that LIC remains firm on its stands so it protects policyholders’ money and supports India’s long-term growth. Facts: LIC is not just another company. It is India’s largest financial institution, managing Rs 55 lakh crore of the nation’s savings. Almost every Indian family has some connection with LIC. That is why any attack on LIC’s credibility does not just affect LIC — it affects India’s trust in its own institutions. Some organised groups are spreading selective information, but they do not tell you that private institutions like SBI Life, HDFC Life, HDFC, ICICI, Kotak, and many mutual funds hold similar or sometimes larger exposures in the same companies. Singling out only LIC creates confusion and unnecessary fear. LIC follows strict rules — no special treatment for anyone LIC cannot invest more than 1% of its total fund in any corporate group. Every investment has to go through: Detailed checks, IRDAI regulations, Board approvals. Reliance on Proxy Advisors No single officer or politician can decide where LIC invests. LIC’s money is spread across the entire economy LIC has investments in 300+ top Indian companies — Adani, Reliance, Tata, Aditya Birla and many more. It does not depend on any one group or one sector. In fact, LIC’s investments have multiplied because of this disciplined approach. Its equity portfolio grew from Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2014 to Rs 15.5 lakh crore today — a 10x increase. Most of the remaining fund — about Rs 40 lakh crore — is in AAA-rated government debt and in ‘AAA’ rated assets from other companies such as Adanis, Tatas and Reliance--the safest category of investment. But why is LIC being targeted now? A lot of the criticism focuses on LIC’s investment in one or two particular groups such as Adani and Reliance. But look at the facts: Since 2017, LIC invested about Rs 31,000 crore in Adani group. Today, the value is around Rs 65,000 crore. That is not a loss — that is a gain because of proper due diligence. In debt, LIC invested Rs 5,000 crore ‘AAA’ rated bonds from Adani which drew so much attention. Meanwhile, similar or larger investments in the same group have been made since LIC’s investment by US insurers like Athene Life, MetLife ($750 million/Rs 6,700 crore) and by Indian institutions like HDFC Bank (Rs 10,000 crore+), Japan’s largest banks such as MUFG and Mizuho, and some of Europe’s largest Banks such as DZ World (Germany’s largest bank, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Standard Chartered. Blackrock, world’s largest fund has also invested in Adani Group in May 2025. But no one questions them. This selective criticism creates doubt, not clarity. It can lead to decision paralysis, similar to what India faced between 2010 and 2013, when confusion around coal, power and defence halted projects and slowed the economy. Why LIC invests in companies like Adani and Reliance that own infrastructure? To understand this, think simply: If you want stability, you invest in something that gives steady income every year. Infrastructure — power lines, airports, ports, energy distribution, and logistics — gives exactly that. It is predictable and steady, like rent from a house or income from a shop. This is not an Indian idea — this is a global insurance model. Look at Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway Many people admire Warren Buffett. His company controls major infrastructure assets in the North America (US and Canada): Electric generation power plants (Coal, natural gas and hydro) Transmission and distribution assets in North America (US and Canada) and Uk Solar and wind plants Natural Gas storage facilities and pipelines Largest railroads and rail maintenance companies in North America Some of the companies it owns includes Mid American Energy Cmopany, PacifiCorp, NV Energy, Northern Powergrid, BHE Pipeline Group, BHE Renewables, BNSF Railway, Altalinks etc. Berkshire generates near 20% of profits only from infrastructure sector. Interestingly, these are the very infrastructure areas where India’s largest infra player Adani operates with assets that are rated ‘AAA’ or safest by any standards by all rating agencies. Despite that anti-India forces want LIC to not invest in companies like Adani and Reliance. A Rs 5,000 crore (0.1% of LIC’s total AUM) recent investment(May 2025) by LIC in Adani created so much noise, while US insurance companies such as Meta Life, Athene Life invested Rs 6,700 crore (USD 750 Mn) invested more than that (In June 2025). India has only a few groups that operate such large, national-scale infrastructure. Groups like Adani, Reliance, and Tata run: Transmission lines, Renewable Energy, Energy networks, Ports, Logistics Chains, Roads, Airports These assets usually have AAA or high safety ratings from rating agencies. For an insurer like LIC — which needs to think 20, 30, even 40 years ahead — such companies offer stability, security, and steady income. This is exactly why global insurers invest heavily in infrastructure. LIC is doing the same — following the same global best practices. A growing attempt to destabilise the Indian economy by creating systemic risk in the insurance sector. In contrast to large global insurers, many Indian insurers, not just LIC, but SBI Life, and ICICI Prudential, have significant exposure to the IT and banking sectors—industries highly vulnerable to technological disruption and geopolitical shocks. Recent events, such as the US USD 100,000 visa rule, sent immediate tremors through India’s IT sector. Looking ahead, innovations like AI could replace large portions of IT services, affecting companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. The critical question is: if a major natural disaster, pandemic, or economic shock occurs in 2040, will insurers heavily exposed to volatile sectors be able to meet their obligations and pay claims? This underscores the strategic importance of long-term, stable infrastructure investments, which safeguard both policyholders and the broader economy. So the question is not “Why LIC invested here?” The real question is “Why should LIC not invest here, when every global insurer does?” LIC has always protected policyholders — since 1956 Even during earlier periods when LIC had exposure to troubled companies, LIC never defaulted or failed its customers. LIC under the UPA government took a big hit on investments as it made big investments in Mallya companies, DLF, GVK, Gitanjali Gems, Vakrangee etc—but no such cases in the past ten years. Since 2014, there has not been a single major investment failure of the kind seen earlier. As mentioned previously LIC’s equity portfolio has 10-folded from Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 15.5 lakh crore. Investments in companies such as Adani, Tatas and Reliance is a major reason. Disclaimer: NDTV Profit is a subsidiary of AMG Media Networks Limited, an Adani Group Company.

Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $274, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: If you were laid off, you could 'boomerang' back to your old company. Here's who's more likely to be asked back.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sometimes a layoff isn't a farewell forever. Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle "AI-induced pressures" and economic uncertainty. "In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent," Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. "In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know," Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. "Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees," she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. "Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job — nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore," Derler said. "Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know." Derler said all parties need to have good "layoff hygiene," where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your résumé or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin — not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. "When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call," she said. "Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them." Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF records $114 million in net outflows amid market volatility

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw approximately $114 million in net inflows on November 28 amid ongoing crypto market volatility. The substantial outflow comes as many investors continue reducing their digital asset exposure. The selloff reflects investor sentiment across US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have experienced notable outflows in recent weeks. BlackRock has observed clients pulling back from Bitcoin positions during the current crypto market downturn. In recent weeks, major funds have reported significant Bitcoin sell-offs as the crypto market faces heightened volatility. The trend aligns with institutional investors’ broader strategy of reducing exposure to digital assets during periods of market uncertainty. Despite outflows from IBIT, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs still finished Friday in the green, buoyed by fresh inflows into funds run by Fidelity, ARK Invest, and Grayscale. The group collectively pulled in around $71 million. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password? Sign In

Title: Want to work from home? Here's how 7 people got their managers on board — or secured flexibility themselves

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After months of battling LA traffic, Leslie Snipes decided it was time to talk to her manager. For the first few months of her job as a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency, she drove 60 to 90 minutes to the office a few days a week — but the commute eventually began to take a toll. "I was wasting hours just sitting in traffic," said the 34-year-old. In April of last year, Snipes decided to ask her manager whether she could work remotely almost exclusively. She explained that she'd be more productive working from home and that her team's strongest bonding often happened during business trips and off-site projects. Snipes said she received verbal approval in less than a day — and that she now typically works from the office once or twice a month to "show face" and connect with colleagues. "I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic," she said. "It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked." While some workers are more than happy to return to the office for camaraderie and a change of scenery, Business Insider spoke to seven people who have found ways to secure flexible work arrangements — whether or not they're officially sanctioned. Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work, said work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years, despite companies' implementing stricter return-to-office mandates. He believes that's offset by other employers — many of them smaller companies and startups — offering more flexibility. He also hypothesizes that employees are securing exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. Bloom pointed out a possible motivating factor for allowing these exceptions: Managers are generally judged on how their teams perform, and they don't want to risk their best talent quitting or becoming less productive if they're forced back to the office. For this reason, some managers may choose not to enforce office attendance policies too strictly. "Managers ultimately care about their team performance," he said. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers about how they've responded to corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and return-to-office mandates.

Read more on the topic: Childcare responsibilities are a common factor pushing workers to secure work-from-home flexibility. In November 2024, Georg Loewen began working as a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency with a three-day-a-week in-office policy, which required him to make a roughly one-hour commute from New Jersey to Manhattan. But that commute proved challenging. Loewen was responsible for dropping off his one-year-old daughter at day care most mornings, and the 8 a.m. drop-off often made it difficult to catch the ideal 8:20 train that would get him to the office just before 9 — the next one wouldn't get him in until after 10. Even when he was on time, finding a parking spot at the station wasn't guaranteed. Early this year, Loewen's manager initiated a conversation about his challenges getting into the office. Eventually, they came to an agreement. "If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home," said the 34-year-old. Loewen said he typically works from the office once or twice a week. His current routine involves dropping off his daughter, heading home to park his car, and then riding a foldable bike 1.5 miles to the station, which allows him to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot. He said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but added that he's consistently felt supported. He may need to work from the office more frequently as his team grows, he said, but for now, he's grateful for the leeway he's been given. A Wisconsin-based mother of three is similarly thankful for the flexible understanding she came to with her manager. In 2023, she'd considered leaving her corporate manufacturing role after the company announced a five-day-a-week office policy. She worried she couldn't meet her childcare responsibilities with a two-hour round-trip commute. Instead, she had an "off the record" conversation with her manager about how much remote work she could get away with. She said they told her to "be here as much as you can." As long as she was in the office a few days a week — especially on days with key in-person meetings — they wouldn't stand in her way. "If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK," she said. Some workers have found creative ways to spend less time at the office. When Elysa Ellis began looking for a new role last year, she was hesitant to give up the remote work flexibility she'd grown used to. After landing an interview with a local nonprofit that required employees to work from the office five days a week, she came with a prepared request: a 9-to-3 schedule, instead of the typical 9-to-5. Ellis said it was important for her to be able to pick up her two children from school around 3 p.m. and spend time with them until her husband finished work. "My children are young, so I knew that stepping into an in-office role would impact them a lot," she said, adding, "I felt like I had nothing to lose." By the time Ellis was offered the job, her request had been granted. She would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. — and still receive her full salary. In 2022, when a millennial IT professional heard rumors that his employer might implement a stricter return-to-office policy, he began searching for a new role. Shortly after, he landed an offer for a remote position similar to his current role. However, he was hesitant to resign while his company's official policy still allowed remote work, so he decided to secretly juggle both roles — earning $250,000 annually, roughly double his previous income. And if his initial employer ever adopted a stricter in-office policy, he figured he had a backup plan. "I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much," he said. For a millennial finance manager at Amazon, maximizing his work-from-home time meant doing the bare minimum at the office. When Amazon announced in 2023 that it would require corporate employees to work from the office three days a week, he began going in the required number of days — but only worked between nine and 12 hours total across all three days. He said it was feasible because he was the only member of his team based at that office. "I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement," he said. For some, the simplest way to secure work-from-home flexibility is to find a job that offers it from day one. After being laid off from a remote job, a New Jersey-based e-commerce professional landed an offer last year for a role at JPMorgan — one that would require him to commute to a Manhattan office three days a week. As he considered the offer, he estimated that commuting would take nine hours a week and cost him more than $7,000 a year. Around the same time, he received another offer — this one for a remote role with a salary about $5,000 lower than the JPMorgan position. When he compared the two jobs in terms of what he'd earn for every hour he'd have to "invest" in them — factoring in both commuting time and related costs — he said the decision was easy. "JPMorgan just could not compete," he said, adding: "A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering." Jump to

Don't call it a bubble! Loss-making monster OpenAI is on the hook for $1.4 trillion (with a T) in compute commitments, as companies start turning to debt to fund the AI craze.

Don't call it a bubble, friends! You can't move five pixels on the internet without being hit with something AI related these days (my apologies for contributing there). Whether it's bad memes on your Instagram feed or AI-powered bots flooding X, or even nation states turning to AI to write government policy — AI has become the tech craze du jour and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable. Microsoft has bet heavily on OpenAI to fuel its own AI efforts, spearheaded by Microsoft Copilot. So far, Copilot has been something of a dud for any serious real-world use case, requiring constant human intervention to fact check and correct errors. Much the same is true for Google Gemini, Grok, and other artificial intelligence platforms, which so far seem to have found a niche as expensive meme creation tools — nowhere near providing the promised productivity boost. That isn't stopping the speculation, though. The assumption is that one day large language models (LLMs) and other related AI technologies fostered by Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT actually will be a great and infallible productivity tool for genuine work. It already is decent for providing basic overviews of highly-covered, well-sourced topics, even as hallucinations and sycophancy continue to dog the tech, particularly in situations where accountability is more critical. Despite today's downsides, many companies are salivating at the idea of cheap virtual humans replacing real humans who need money to eat and time to sleep. Big Tech is racing to meet this possibility with panicked fervour, and recent analyses from FT and HSBC (via Fortune) suggest that things are potentially getting a bit ... irrational. Recent data shows that companies are increasingly relying on debt, rather than real revenue and cashflow to fund commitments to OpenAI and vice-versa. OpenAI has made a truly staggering $1.4 trillion (with a T) in commitments for compute to meet its projected needs, despite posting a "paltry" $20 billion in revenues this annum. To put it into context, $20 billion represents just 1.43~% of that $1.4 trillion commitment. It's a truly insane gap. OpenAI is exploring a range of revenue-generating initiatives to change its fortunes, including in-line ads within ChatGPT. Although a lot of it revolves around replacing human workers with AI, particularly in hospitality and customer service sectors. It would be theoretically far cheaper for very large companies to replace their human workers with ChatGPT, even if those contracts cost millions. That is, if it can provide customers with a satisfactory experience. Gartner previously projected that many companies turning to AI to replace workers are already reversing course. But I digress. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. HSBC projects that even if OpenAI is making $200 billion by 2030, it would still need a staggering $207 billion in funding to stay afloat. As OpenAI scales, so does its costs. Its expensive frontier models like Sora 2 and GPT-5 cost millions of dollars a day to run, requiring enormous amounts of compute. These models are given away at cost in attempts to drive adoption, create lock-in, and essentially alter human behavior. You can think of it similarly to Spotify, which spent well over a decade completely unprofitable until it had basically re-written the way humans consume music and how labels distribute music. OpenAI is trying to achieve a similar result on a far, far larger, and potentially far more damaging scale. Spotify collapsing wouldn't have had any impact on the global economy. But, if we get to a point where it seems the economics of "AI" and LLMs simply don't work — it could have a similar impact on markets to the dot com bubble or the credit crunch. There's simply so much invested in these companies and initiatives right now, that inability to service the debt would trigger a wave of instability. Whether it's power constraints, model inbreeding damaging long-term viability of data quality, or simply because it actually sucks and is nothing more than a novelty — it could be the case that AI is simply not destined to make real money. This is one reason why Microsoft has been focusing on efficiency and low-power consumption in its home-grown MAI models. Microsoft has focused its efforts on the constraints of global compute and energy markets as the tech's biggest bottleneck. But, like others, it's betting the bulk of its AI future on OpenAI, and that bet is exactly that. A gamble. The fragility of this whole ecosystem is increasingly coming to light. FT reports that of the $1.4 trillion compute commitments OpenAI has made, its partners are actually turning to debt themselves to meet those demands. Softbank, Oracle, CoreWeave, Blue Owl Capital, Crusoe, Vantage, and other venture capital firms and cloud providers have taken on a staggering $96 billion in debt in 2025 to give OpenAI the compute it's asking for. OpenAI is reportedly on the hook to meet these commitments whether or not demand materializes, too. The commitments are spread across the next eight years, and could trigger a cash flow crisis if OpenAI fails to find the funding to pay up. HSBC's most optimistic estimates suggest that OpenAI will hit 3 billion weekly active users by 2030, with 300 million of those paying a subscription. Even with this scale, Microsoft and other OpenAI partners could be on the hook to plough hundreds of billions more into OpenAI to keep it cash flow positive. OpenAI recently restructured its deal with Microsoft to that end, to help it find other sources of revenue and compute. Some of this analysis likely excludes fresh constraints, too, like the DRAM price crisis AI has triggered. Compute is going to get more expensive, not less expensive, with wafer and silicon capacity fully constrained. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently explained how the company is leaving compute on the literal shelf because it physically can't source the electricity it needs to meet demand. Will Microsoft et al. need to become energy suppliers on top of server companies? There's also no guarantee that energy costs in general will remain stable either, as global politics and climate change also continue to play a role. OpenAI and other AI companies have been lobbying to make LLMs a matter of national security to that end, seeking full-blown government backing and guarantees. The delicate balance of debt and speculation threatens to wipe out billions if connected companies default and become insolvent, which will drive a wave of corrections hitting the biggest players like NVIDIA and Microsoft. All of this falls apart if humans don't adopt the tech. This is why you've seen Meta cram its lame chatbots into WhatsApp and Instagram. This is why Notepad and Paint now have useless Copilot buttons on Windows. This is why Google Gemini wants to "help you" read and reply to your emails. They're trying to change our habits, because all of the projections rely on people becoming truly dependent on the technology. Whether or not it's actually a good thing for society isn't considered to be a factor. They're forcing it on us because if we don't use it, if we don't subscribe to it, buy products through it, or click on ads through it — the debt structure will inevitably implode. It will wipe out billions in unpaid loans. And as usual, the banks will be bailed out, and the tax payer will have to foot the bill. Higher costs, decreased employment opportunities, higher interest rates, and likely another round of sticky inflation. But hey, I'm sure all the big players will have cashed out their stocks way before any of that happens. In reality, LLM technology is here to stay, but the constraints are becoming untenable. The efficacy and efficiency of the models at hyperscales has become the real bottleneck. Electricity and water requirements are impacting tax payers. Crucially, will people ever want to pay for this stuff? It's not ideal that OpenAI's success may depend on big companies using it to replace human workers at huge scales. How will people pay for OpenAI if nobody has a job? Where will OpenAI get its training data if the human-led information economy falls apart? The business model seems like a bit of a negative feedback loop, at least on the face of it. Costs will have to come down rapidly in my view for any of this to actually work. It probably won't be LLM research alone that fuels the next wave of innovation as a result, but energy and server technology breakthroughs. But that's an exploration for another article. Will OpenAI and others hit the profitability before the debt bubble bursts? It'll be interesting to see what the next five years brings.

Title: BlackRock shifts 4,044 BTC and 80,121 ETH – But it’s NOT fresh buying!

ETF redemptions moved $354M BTC and $235M ETH, signaling capital exiting rather than fresh buying. The crypto market remains in a tense holding pattern, with Bitcoin struggling to stay above the key $91,000 level. This persistent volatility often signals weakness, suggesting bulls are finding it difficult to gain control. However, the moves by Wall Street’s largest players stand in sharp contrast to these concerns. Reports show BlackRock moved a massive $589 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Arkham data confirming it received $354 million in BTC and $235 million in ETH from Coinbase. At first, this seems like a major accumulation, but it actually reflects a deeper structural shift. Despite Bitcoin [BTC] trading near $90,898 and Ethereum [ETH] remaining above $3,000, at press time, these inflows into BlackRock’s wallets are not new purchases. Many assume this activity is triggering a market “flush,” but that misses the real story. The current volatility isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s part of crypto’s transition into a more mature, institutional system. The transfers reveal how ETF redemptions work and highlight the widening gap between what on-chain data shows and what’s actually happening in the market. Under the cash creation process, market makers manage ETF withdrawals by repurchasing ETF shares and selling an equivalent amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum to remain hedged. Once this sale is complete, they redeem the ETF shares with BlackRock and receive the actual BTC or ETH. This step triggers large on-chain transfers from Coinbase Prime to their wallets. In the past three days alone, these redemptions have moved 4,044 BTC worth $354 million and 80,121 ETH worth $235 million on-chain. Importantly, these transfers do not represent new buying activity. Instead, they mark the final handoff of crypto following earlier sell pressure from investor exits. In short, this reflects capital leaving the ETF system rather than entering it. Overall, BlackRock’s strategy highlights a sharp divide between speculative enthusiasm and institutional discipline. By dismissing most altcoins as “worthless” and concentrating solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm is anchoring itself to assets it views as durable, liquid, and more likely to meet regulatory standards Combined, all these factors point to the fact that the future of institutional crypto will be built on select assets and scalable financial infrastructure and not on chasing the ever-expanding altcoin universe.

About us Copy link Investors have deployed nearly $25 billion into crypto companies in 2025, dwarfing last year’s by over 150% and blowing past market watchers’ expectations. Top guns involved in dealmaking this year include tech-focused firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, as well as Wall Street juggernauts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The most popular sectors? Centralised exchanges with $4.4 billion, prediction markets with $3.2 billion, and DeFi platforms with $2.9 billion, according to data from DefiLlama. “The projects attracting capital today are those aligned with regulatory clarity, operational resilience, and the ability to integrate with TradFi institutions and their standards,” Jordan Knecht, head of institutional strategies at GlobalStake, the blockchain services firm, told DL News. “In the middle of a choppy market, investors are signalling that they prefer durable, compliance-first businesses that aim to establish a long-term foundation for this asset class,” Knecht said. Knecht isn’t alone to note that the crypto market has evolved this year. Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto-native advisory firm BlockSpaceForce, told DL News that “the environment for crypto startups is shifting.” Chong said that capital is rotating toward mature players whose revenue and unit economics justify valuation. “None of this signals weakness; it simply reflects a market that is normalising and maturing,” he said, adding that raises are “becoming more rational, more aligned with fundamentals, and less driven by reflexive speculation.” Georgii Verbitskii, angel investor and founder of the crypto investment firm TYMIO, told DL News that crypto is closely following the same pattern as other market cycles. “In every major technology cycle, capital first flows into the base layer — the rails, liquidity, and settlement systems — before it moves into consumer-facing applications,” he said. Here are some of the most notable raises this year. Binance, said to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, secured a massive raise of $2 billion in March. This significant capital injection was led by Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology investor MGX. Binance CEO Richard Teng said that “this investment by MGX is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and for Binance. Betting platform Polymarket closed a major funding round worth $2 billion in October, led by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing it around $8 billion. Once a fringe crypto‑betting site, the capital infusion reflects high institutional confidence. Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the $76 billion stablecoin USDC, raised $1.1 billion in its June initial public offering. The blockbuster IPO was led by JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs serving as joint lead bookrunners, joined by Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale as bookrunners. Founded in 2013, Circle has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the United States’ warming to the crypto industry.

Heading out of office on a characteristically pathetic note, city Comptroller Brad Lander mounted his high horse to demand city pension funds burn money on a symbolic stand against clmate change. Fund officials must cut ties with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, he preached — because those firms have stopped bowing to the anti-carbon hysteria. “Climate risk is financial risk,” Lander emoted. “You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires.” Never mind that actual science doesn’t show such impacts from global warming, nor do major companies fail to account for all manner of genuine downside risks in their earnings forecasts: Loons like Lander want the financial world to pretend that every firm that isn’t (wrongly) assuming a climate catastrophe is coming isn’t worth investing in. BlackRock rightly slammed Lander’s hissy fit as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander’s insistence on performative virtue-signaling, instead of acting in the best interest of 800,000 current and former city workers (and the taxpayers who ultimately guarantee public pensions) is another reason to cheer his departure from the city payroll.

The simply truth is that “decarbonizing” pension funds won’t do a darned thing to save the planet, but only reduce the returns on the funds’ investments. An honest comptroller wouldn’t strive to waste public monies on ideological hobby horses. Cross your fingers that Lander’s Dec 31 exit from the comptroller’s office will mark the end of his disgraceful political career. And pray that Democratic voters don’t entertain this preposterous fraud’s expected challenge to Rep. Dan Goldman in next June’s primary: Make Brad finally have to earn a living in the private sector.

Title: The Best Black Friday 2025 VR Headset Discounts & Deals
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/best-black-friday-2025-vr-headset-deals/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T22:05:25Z

Considering jumping into VR this Black Friday, or gifting a headset to a friend or relative so they can join you? Here are the best deals available. Meta Quest headsets are the ideal way to get into VR and mixed reality for most people. They are fully standalone, meaning you don't need any external device (other than a phone app to initially set them up), and they can also wirelessly connect to SteamVR on a gaming PC, if you have one, for a higher fidelity experience. There are currently two headsets in Meta's lineup, the budget Quest 3S and the higher-end Quest 3. Quest 3S is normally $300, while Quest 3 is normally $500. The excellent Black Friday 2025 deals for Quest 3S offer both a lower price and added perks, making it an ideal holiday gift, while there's only one Quest 3 deal we're aware of, and it only offers a perk. Still, if you have the funds, we always recommend the proper Quest 3. While Quest 3S reuses the old fresnel lenses from Quest 2, Quest 3 features Meta's advanced pancake lenses which are clearer and sharper over a wider area, have a wider field of view, and have precise separation adjustment, making them suitable for essentially everyone's eyes. These pancake lenses also enable Quest 3 to be thinner, which makes the headset feel slightly less heavy. Best Buy is offering a $75 gift card and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Quest 3 purchases. You could, for example, use the Best Buy gift card to get a rigid strap and softer facial interface – upgrades which can make the headset feel more comfortable to wear. During the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. And you still get the 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. If you're a Costco member, you can get Quest 3S for $200, and if you're not, you can get it for $215. That's $85-$100 off the regular price. In both cases, Costco's deal comes with 12 months of Horizon+, compared to the 3 months you normally get with a new Meta headset. Horizon+ includes a Games Catalog with some of Quest's best VR games, including Asgard's Wrath 2, Cubism, Demeo, Dungeons of Eternity, Eleven Table Tennis, Ghosts of Tabor, Job Simulator, Maestro, Onward, Pistol Whip, Red Matter, Synth Riders, The Climb 2, and Walkabout Mini Golf. It also lets subscribers redeem 2 monthly games pre-selected by Meta. The Costco deal lasts through December 2, the coming Tuesday, so make sure to grab it soon if you want to affordably bring a friend or relative into VR. Quest 3S is $250 at Best Buy, and the retailer is offering a $50 Best Buy gift card, 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners VR game. That's a $50 discount from the headset's regular $300 price, and the three perks together are worth $110. You can find the deal for the 128GB base model of Quest 3S here. A similar offer is available for the 256GB storage model, with a $330 price ($70 off) and the same perks. You still get 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. You could use the $50 Best Buy gift card to get the Elite Strap to make the headset more comfortable for just $20, for example, while during the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play popular flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. As for The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, it's also normally $30, and it's widely considered to be one of the best VR games of all time due to its physics-based combat system, earning an 'Essential' score in our review. PlayStation VR2 is $300 at all official retailers until December 19, its lowest price ever. PlayStation VR2 is not a standalone headset, and it has a cable which needs to be connected to a host device. It connects to the PS5 or PS5 Pro console out of the box, and can alternatively connect to a gaming PC with the sold-separately PC adapter. This price applies to both the regular SKU and the bundle with Horizon Call of the Mountain, so you should always grab the latter if it's in stock. At this discounted price, PlayStation VR2 is an ideal option for a PS5 owner heavily invested in the PlayStation ecosystem, or, with the adapter, a PC owner interested in sim racing, flight sim, or other seated games. The PS VR2 discount is available for another three weeks, so there should be plenty of time to grab one in time for Christmas. Pico 4 Ultra is a Quest 3 competitor from ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok. It isn't sold in North America, so if you're in the US or Canada you can ignore its existence. For those who are in a region where Pico 4 Ultra is sold, the Black Friday 2025 deal prices it at €400, and comes with 2 VR games and a season pass for Premier League Player. Those 2 VR games are Pistol Whip and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad, widely considered to be among the best VR games of all time. The headset is normally priced at €600, so this is a massive €200 discount. And the 2 VR games and season pass are worth €100 together, meaning the total extra value here is €300. Pico 4 Ultra holds up relatively well to Quest 3, but while the Pico Store has a decent chunk of the content available on Quest 3, it still lacks many of the games you'll find on Meta's platform, particularly the blockbuster exclusives. However, ByteDance has a unique offering which Meta has ruled out making an equivalent of: Pico Motion Trackers. They're lightweight wireless pucks that you can strap to yourself to add various levels of body tracking in supported titles. For Black Friday get a pair for €70 to strap to your ankles to add leg tracking. Then, you can add the 'Waist Version' for €40 to improve the quality of body tracking and get a true orientation for your waist. And if you want to go even further, you can now get a second €70 pair for your upper leg or forearms, improving leg or arm tracking, for a total of 5 trackers. Supported titles for Pico Motion Trackers include VRChat (both standalone and via wireless PC VR) and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin may be closing in on a new all-time high after moves in the derivatives market and fresh buying from large holders, according to market watchers and on-chain data. Max Keiser, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, pointed to a filing by Nasdaq to increase options limits for BlackRock’s IBIT to 1 million contracts — a jump that represents roughly a 40x expansion from prior levels — as a key development that could remove barriers to bigger institutional flows. According to Nasdaq paperwork and public commentary, the previous 25,000 contract cap had been seen by some as too small for rising volume. Market experts argued that earlier limits were “discriminatorily small” and suggested that 400,000 contracts would be a more reasonable baseline given current demand. Some described the change as a move that could place IBIT into a mega-cap derivatives category, unlocking follow-on effects for how banks and funds structure exposure to bitcoin. I first explained this in 2017: Now that BTC derivatives market was just expanded by 40x New ATH’s are in play. **November 2, 2017** Max Keiser first discussed Bitcoin market makers needing to expand their inventory to support higher prices in this X post: “Wall St traders… https://t.co/aBQ5DdSDay — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 27, 2025 Market makers will be able to hedge larger positions without hitting the old size wall, which can lower spreads and deepen available liquidity. Based on reports, that also means banks can build structured notes that use IBIT as a reference without tripping existing risk caps — and JPMorgan is reportedly preparing Bitcoin-backed structured notes that would track BlackRock IBIT. Those products could channel steady, institutional flows into the market rather than one-off spikes. According to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score by cohort, holders of 10,000 BTC or more have flipped to net accumulation and now show a score of 0.8, signaling strong buying. The 1,000 to 10,000 BTC group has also turned positive for the first time since September, while the 100 to 1,000 BTC cohort has been in active accumulation since October and continued buying through recent declines. Even retail holders with less than 1 BTC are showing their strongest accumulation since July. Bitcoin’s price behavior supports the buying narrative. The token fell into the low $80,000 area that served as support in May and then climbed back above $90,000 quickly, which many traders took as a sign that the market sees value in the $80,000 zone. Based on reports, the average cost basis for US spot bitcoin ETFs was near $82,000, and that figure has been cited as a reason institutions found the dip attractive. Keiser had warned previously that when size limits blocked hedging, the market would be prone to pullbacks — and some analysts say that is part of the reason for recent volatility. Expanding the options cap allows volume sellers to enter more smoothly, which could reduce erratic swings but will not erase market risk. Price spikes are still possible and downside moves remain a real threat if flows slow or macro conditions shift.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Snapchat is nearing 1 billion monthly users. Why can’t it turn a profit?

By Queenie Wong, Los Angeles Times Snapchat, an app whose disappearing messages and silly face filters made chatting with loved ones more casual, is close to a milestone that few social media platforms achieve: reaching 1 billion monthly users. But Snap, the Santa Monica company behind the app, faces a crucial test. The 14-year-old tech company is still losing money and has seen its share price tumble as it barrels forward to popularize augmented reality glasses next year. And even though more people in developing countries are using the app, Snapchat usage in markets where the company makes more revenue per user, including the United States and Europe, has dropped. Snapchat has 943 million monthly active users globally, according to the company. Growth in India, where TikTok is banned, and Pakistan have fueled Snapchat’s global user growth, data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show. In India, Snapchat monthly users have surpassed 250 million, making up more than a quarter of its user base, according to numbers Snap released in July. At the same time, in the third quarter, Snapchat monthly active users declined by 4% in the U.S. and double digits in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, Sensor Tower said. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel wrote in a September note to employees the company is in a “crucible moment,” comparing it to a “middle child” wedged between larger tech giants and smaller rivals. “This moment isn’t just about survival,” Spiegel wrote in the note. “It’s about proving that a different way of building technology, one that deepens friendships and inspires creativity, can succeed in a world that often rewards the opposite.” The 35-year-old tech executive co-founded Snapchat — initially known as Picaboo — in 2011 with friends as part of a class project while attending Stanford University. Back then, texts and photos posted on social media such as Facebook and Instagram were more permanent. Snapchat’s logo is a ghost and the app distinguished itself from its competitors by giving people a way to share photos and messages that disappeared once someone viewed it. Instead of a social media app that opens to a feed of content, Snapchat opens to a camera. Rather than worry about whether they looked perfect, people leaned into quirky and creative ways to express themselves. They overlaid effects onto their selfies, transforming their faces into cute dogs and even puking rainbows. The app encouraged people to keep sending these disappearing messages known as “Snaps” to their loved ones at least once a day, keeping what’s known as a “streak” alive. As Snapchat’s popularity soared, fueling the rise of vertical videos, bigger social media rivals took notice. Snapchat’s co-founders turned down Facebook’s multibillion-dollar offer to buy the company. Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram copied Snapchat’s signature features including Stories, which allowed people to post images and videos that vanish after 24 hours. This prompted some Snapchat users to flock to its rival Instagram. Spiegel jokingly titled himself as the vice president of product at Meta, Facebook’s parent company, on LinkedIn, a nod to the social media giant’s cloning of Snapchat’s features. Although Snapchat set itself apart from other social media, it also faced similar concerns tech platforms grappled with such as child safety and mental health. The app is popular among teenagers, prompting some users to question if they’re too old for Snapchat and should leave. Investor confidence in the company has plummeted. In 2021, Snap’s stock peaked at more than $83 per share. Snap’s share price closed Tuesday at $7.64. Competing with larger rivals such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, for ad dollars has been challenging for Snapchat and it has struggled to consistently turn a profit. Apple’s privacy feature made it tougher for advertisers to track users across apps and websites, posing an extra hurdle for social networks. Research firm eMarketer estimates that in 2025 Snapchat will claim 2.1% of U.S. social network ad spending, but said that share is dropping. Snapchat’s initial focus on disappearing messages made it tougher for the company to rope in advertisers because people typically don’t want to see ads in the middle of a private conversation. But the company has been updating its ad tools and expanded the places where ads are shown, including between short videos. Although Snapchat is popular among Gen Z and millennials, its audience might limit what businesses want to advertise on its platform. “It definitely skews a lot younger and that naturally sort of limits advertiser interests in its audience,” said Max Willens, a senior analyst at eMarketer. If a business wants to advertise retirement planning, for example, they would probably go to Facebook instead of Snapchat. On Snapchat, advertisers have also used augmented reality effects to promote their brands in quirky ways to a young audience. Snapchat users can transform themselves into a dancing McDonald’s McRib sandwich or snap selfies with digital animals from the Disney film “Zootopia 2.” Snap has been looking at other ways to make money. The company offers subscription plans so users can customize the app’s wallpaper, personalize their digital avatars known as Bitmojis and see how often their friends view their content. It started to limit the amount of free storage it offers to 5 gigabytes. AI company Perplexity said it will pay Snap $400 million over one year so users can find answers from its “AI-powered answer engine.” In the third quarter, Snap revenue reached $1.5 billion, up 10% compared with the same period last year. The company narrowed its net loss to $104 million, versus a net loss of $153 million during the year-earlier period. This month, JP Morgan analysts raised Snap’s price target to $8 after the Perplexity deal but kept an underweight rating on the shares, meaning they expect the stock to underperform. The firm said Snap has “a sizable market opportunity, an engaged user base, and a solid track record of innovation” but it’s also looking for “more consistent execution, improved user & revenue trends, & greater profitability.” Snap has made bold and expensive bets on the future of computing by releasing a drone and glasses to capture photos and videos — though those products flopped. Now Snap plans to release augmented reality glasses in 2026 that let people interact with digital images overlaid onto the physical world. Instead of taking out your phone, people will be able to review documents, stream movies, play chess and more through glasses. For now, analysts say it’s too early to tell if Snap’s bets will pay off or the company will end up in the social media graveyard like Myspace or Vine. “There’s nothing written down that says you just get to be around forever if you’re a social media platform,” Willens said. “Although almost all of those still kind of trudge along in some state or another.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Could Intel be closer to scoring a deal with iPhone maker Apple? The chipmaker's shares surged Friday as an analyst added fuel to rumors that the iPhone maker could become a new customer for the chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) popped over 10% during Friday's shortened trading session to lead gains on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. (Read Investopedia's daily markets coverage here.) The likelihood of Apple (AAPL) becoming a new customer for Intel "has recently improved significantly," TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, citing industry surveys, posted on X Friday, suggesting that Intel could start shipping Apple processors as soon as 2027. A deal with Apple could boost confidence in a turnaround for Intel, which still faces persistent worries about its ability to secure long-term commitments to its manufacturing business. Apple and Intel did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. Shares of Intel have roughly doubled in value this year after a flurry of recent deals, including a partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). Still, they remain well off their historical highs as the company is still working to convince investors regarding a sustainable turnaround in its business. One of those challenges continues to be securing new customers for its manufacturing operation. The deal with Nvidia did not include commitments to Intel's foundry, raising speculation about whether the relationship could expand later or if the lack of foundry commitments could point to troubles convincing customers. A deal with former Intel customer Apple could go a long way in helping assuage those concerns. Shares of Apple rose a bit less than 0.5% on Friday.

Title: The best Black Friday PC hardware deals: Graphics cards, SSDs, and accessories are down to record-low prices

It's Black Friday, and some of the top discounts you'll find are on PC hardware. As one of Business Insider Reviews' computing experts, I can tell you that if you've been waiting to upgrade your PC setup, now's the time, as manufacturers try to clear out all of their 2025 stock ahead of the new year. That means excellent Black Friday discounts on graphics cards, solid-state drives, monitors, and more. Some of the best Black Friday computer hardware deals I've found so far include $90 off a new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU from Asus, a 25% discount on a Nintendo Switch 2-compatible microSD Express card, and a Dell 4K monitor for an all-time low price of $200. I expect deals to come and go as the weekend progresses, so check back here often for updates. And if you're in the market for more than PC hardware, check out our main Black Friday deals page to find sales across tech, style, home, kitchen, and more. The extreme GPU shortage of the early 2020s is largely over, but graphics cards still command a high price. Luckily, GPUs tend to see big discounts on Black Friday. If you're building a new PC or upgrading an old one, consider investing in a new graphics card while these discounts are available. The GeForce RTX 5070 is one of Nvidia's newest graphics cards, offering sufficient power to maintain high framerates in even the most intensive games. This model from Asus uses its popular TUF components, which are built to withstand bumps, scratches, and heat. The RTX 5060 is Nvidia's entry-level card, but don't be fooled — any card in the RTX 50-series line is strong enough to ensure high-quality graphics in nearly any game. The "3X" in this model's name refers to its three built-in fans, which help keep the system cool while you're playing. AMD graphics cards aren't as popular as their Nvidia counterparts, but they're still a great choice for any gamer who wants a powerful (and affordable) GPU. This model comes from Sapphire, a manufacturer that specializes in AMD hardware. Solid-state drives come in three varieties: External, SATA, and NVMe. External drives, as the name implies, sit outside your computer and are portable, which is great for moving files from one system to another. SATA and NVMe drives, however, are installed inside your PC. They're both built for the same purpose, but NVMe drives are smaller and faster. Right now, I'm seeing good deals on External and NVMe SSDs, but not many on SATA options. Western Digital is a titan in the digital storage market, and this WD_Black SSD stick shows why. With a top read speed of nearly 15GB per second, it may be the fastest SSD on the market right now. This drive from Crucial offers ample storage and fast read speeds at a budget-friendly price. It's also compatible with a wide variety of gaming devices, including the PlayStation 5 and ROG Ally X. Advances in digital storage technology have made microSD cards more affordable than ever. That said, Black Friday is a great time to save even more on these tiny storage solutions — especially if you're a Nintendo Switch 2 owner who still needs to buy a new microSD Express card. Big things come in small packages — like this microSD card from Samsung, which comes with a whopping terabyte of storage. That's more space than most computers come equipped with, and it's enough to store thousands of photos. MicroSD Express is the newest standard for microSD cards, and it's also the only type of card that the Nintendo Switch 2 accepts. If you're looking for more space to store your games and screenshots, this 512GB Express card from Samsung is a great choice. It always seems like you run out of USB ports the moment you need them most. Luckily, it doesn't take much work to add more. All you need is a USB-C hub, which turns a single USB-C port on your computer into multiple USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and Ethernet connections. And this Black Friday, I'm finding deals on hubs from every major brand. This USB-C hub from Baseus doesn't just look advanced — it also supports a wider range of devices than nearly any other hub on the market. This includes an Ethernet port, slots for both microSD and SD cards, two HDMI ports, and a wealth of USB ports. Anker has a hub for pretty much any situation. This model, which features HDMI, SD card, Ethernet, and USB ports, offers fast transfer speeds and weighs less than half a pound. UGreen has a lot of clout in the tech accessory world, and this 6-in-1 hub comes highly recommended. It offers HDMI and USB ports, along with fast charging speeds, for a budget price. Sometimes you don't need every type of port under the sun — especially if most of your devices use the same sort of plug. This Belkin hub features four USB-C ports with fast transfer speeds, perfect for Apple aficionados. When most people think of a keyboard and mouse, they probably picture a generic gray slab and blob. Nothing that's worth getting excited about. But modern mouse and keyboard combos are much more than that. I'm finding deals on mechanical keyboards, gaming mice, and even a status symbol among true typing maniacs: a split ergonomic keyboard. Mechanical keyboards, which offer a more tactile response than typical membrane boards, are all the rage these days. This model from Keychron is a great entry-level keyboard, offering clicky keys and a full number pad for a more affordable price than most mechanical boards. Corsair has a reputation for products that are both flashy and functional. This mechanical keyboard lets you give each key its own lighting, transmits inputs at lightning speed, and comes with a detachable soft palm rest. Split keyboards have been around for decades with proven health benefits, but it's only recently that they've really started to come into vogue. This critically acclaimed model can be placed up to 9" apart, laid flat or angled, and includes soft palm rests for extra comfort. Sometimes simpler is better, and this keyboard and mouse bundle from Amazon Basics is about as simple (and affordable) as you can get. The keyboard features full number and media control keys along the top row, and the mouse scrolls and swipes smoothly. You can have the strongest PC in the world, but it doesn't mean much if you don't have a great monitor to match. After all, no game is worth playing, and no movie is worth watching on a dull screen. Black Friday is one of the best times to score a deal on new monitors, and I've found discounts on monitors across a wide range of sizes and types. Curved monitors look cool, but finding a quality product tends to drain your wallet. The exception is this model from Sceptre, which offers nearly 25 inches of HD real estate. Combine that with the fast 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, and you have a top-tier pick for any gaming setup, regardless of budget. 4K monitors aren't rare, but it's not easy to find one at this price. This 27-inch model from Dell features a wide color gamut and fast refresh rates — perfect for graphic design, gaming, and everything in between. You don't need a desktop PC to install a second monitor. This portable monitor is plug-and-play, meaning once you connect it to your laptop or console via USB-C or Mini HDMI, it'll start working right away. And once it's active, it'll dazzle with a high refresh rate and wide color range. Yes, Black Friday and its sister shopping holiday, Cyber Monday, are among the best times of year to buy computer products. Computers and PC accessories tend to drop to exceptionally low prices on Black Friday. This is especially true for products that receive new iterations every so often, like laptops and graphics cards, since manufacturers attempt to clear out their stock ahead of these new releases. It depends on what sort of product you're using, but generally, most accessories will work on both operating systems. Monitors, computer mice, and USB hubs are especially universal. Keyboards are a bit more complicated. Macs and PCs have slightly different keyboard layouts, so they usually require differently labeled boards. Luckily, keyboards with removable keys — such as mechanical boards — usually come with keycaps that match both operating systems, along with a switch to toggle between them. Graphics cards are a completely different story. Macs come with their own custom graphics cards, built directly into the central processor, and they can't be replaced or upgraded. So if you want to use an Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon card, you'll need a PC, preferably a desktop. PC laptops also come with their own special GPUs. Branding doesn't always make sense. When it comes to PC hardware and accessories, "gaming" often tends to be a shorthand for "high quality." "Gaming" mice have more customization options; "gaming" keyboards feel better to type on; "gaming" monitors have more vivid colors and faster response times. Every graphics card is marketed primarily for gaming, even though graphic designers, animators, AI programmers, and other professionals also need them for their work. Why is this? There are probably a few reasons: First, that gamers have a reputation (deserved or not) for being tech-savvy, and thus more demanding of the products they buy; second, that PC gaming is already a high-cost hobby, and anyone willing to drop big bucks on a gaming PC can probably afford a high-quality setup to go with it; and third, to entice impressionable kids and teens who think that a product marketed for "gaming" is cooler than one marketed for checking email. All this is to say that products with "gaming" in the name aren't exclusively for gamers. A good gaming PC is also a good everyday PC, and this philosophy extends to accessories as well.

Nvidia stock fell sharply last week, causing worry for investors, but experts say the company is still strong. Its AI and data center business are growing fast. Google and Meta are creating new AI chips, adding competition. Some investors, like Michael Burry, are cautious about Nvidia’s price. Despite this, Nvidia’s earnings and cash flow remain strong.

Title: EU Set to Launch Full Antitrust Probe Into BlackRock–MSC Bid for Barcelona Port Terminal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Shipping containers are seen at the port of Barcelona, Spain, October 3, 2024. REUTERS/Nacho Doce By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) – BlackRock and MSC’s bid for CK Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port faces a hurdle with EU antitrust regulators set to investigate the Spanish deal, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The deal is separate from and predates BlackRock and MSC’s bid for most of CK Hutchison’s global port operations, Swiss-based MSC said. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison separately wants to sell its 80% holding in the $22.8 billion ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries, a politically sensitive deal that has been caught up in China-U.S. tensions. The likely full-scale investigation by the European Commission, previously unreported, could see regulators demand concessions from BlackRock and MSC in return for clearing the Spanish deal. The Commission declined to comment. BlackRock did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. CK Hutchison has interests in ports across Europe, including in Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. It was not immediately clear if those other European parts of the global acquisition could also eventually come under scrutiny. The non-EU portions of the wider deal fall outside the EU’s review jurisdiction. BARCELONA TERMINAL ACQUISITION UNDER EU SCRUTINY The overall wider package, which includes two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized between Washington and Beijing. The Spanish deal would see Terminal Investment Limited Holding (TiL), a unit of Switzerland-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, and BlackRock acquire joint control of Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port. The terminal can serve multiple mega-ships simultaneously and has an eight-track rail facility – making it the EU’s largest rail terminal on the Mediterranean Sea – that connects the port with traffic to and from Southern Europe. TiL already operates a terminal at the Spanish port of Valencia. The European Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, is set to open a full-scale investigation after its preliminary review of the deal ends on December 10, the person said. Full-scale EU investigations typically last around four months or longer and can lead to firms offering concessions including divestments to address competition concerns and secure regulatory approval.

Title: Michael Burry just started a massive group chat on Substack, and it's as chaotic as you'd expect

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry's group chat is going off. The investor of "The Big Short" fame invited all of his paid Substack subscribers to a group chat on Friday, and it quickly led to hundreds of replies ranging from memes to questions for Burry. This month, Burry pivoted from running a hedge fund to publishing a newsletter named "Cassandra Unchained." It has amassed more than 97,000 subscribers since it launched on Sunday. "This is a conversation space exclusively for paid subscribers—kind of like a group chat or live hangout," reads Burry's introductory post. "I plan to post updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion." The first reply on the chat reads: "I think Dr. Burry just broke Substack." Another early response jokes about Burry's disclosure this week that he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir stock: "I think Dr Burry is going to make more money from Substack than his NVDA and pltr puts 🤣" A third poked fun at a potential spike in traffic to Substack. "Someone pray for substacks backend engineers." "It's gonna be legendburry!!" one subscriber wrote, while another noted: "This chat is gonna be nuts." "Bro don't allow anyone to start threads. This a spam fest," one concerned poster added. Other subscribers rushed to post memes, videos, and even photos of Black Friday crowds. The questions to Burry ranged from who the next chair of the Federal Reserve might be, to how an 80-year-old should invest to prepare for a crash, to how the dollar stacks up against other currencies. Burry resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence, and has wasted no time issuing numerous warnings of an AI bubble and taking aim at key players such as Nvidia and Palantir. The investor, who has 1.6 million X followers, is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the US housing bubble that triggered a global financial crisis, and for issuing dire pronouncements of crashes and recessions. He became famous in financial circles after his bet against the subprime mortgage market was featured in author Michael Lewis' book "The Big Short," and actor Christian Bale played him in the movie adaptation.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang allegedly asks managers discouraging AI use: ‘Are you insane?’ — assures employees their jobs aren’t at risk because of AI

The Nvidia chief reportedly made the statement during an all-hands meeting after its record quarterly earnings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang was allegedly recorded telling his people to use more AI while assuring them that they won’t get replaced by the tool. The head of the AI chip giant is reported to have said this during an all-hands meeting after its record-breaking quarter, which was leaked to Business Insider. The statements were reportedly made during the same meeting where he complained about the drop in Nvidia’s stock price despite performing absolutely well, with Huang saying that the market did not appreciate the company’s ‘incredible’ quarter. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI. Are you insane?” Huang reportedly said in the recording. “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence. I promise you; you will have work to do.” This push to use more AI tools has been happening across the industry, especially among massive tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. These two giants have been mandating their employees to use AI, with the use of such tools becoming a part of their evaluation. Business Insider also reports that Google has instructed its engineers to use AI for coding, while Amazon employees have requested the company to adopt AI coding tool Cursor. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of AI has made most employees wary of being replaced by machines. Even experts and industry leaders have been warning about this trend: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that it could wipe out half of white-collar jobs in the U.S., while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that it could cause up to 20% unemployment in the next half-decade. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory study even created a labor simulation tool that estimates that up to 11.7% of workers are in danger of being replaced by AI. Nevertheless, Jensen Huang has reportedly reassured his employees that they are not in danger of being supplanted by this technology. Despite implementing the use of AI tools, Nvidia has continuously been hiring people, bringing in over 6,000 new faces in its last fiscal year. And amid the increasing tech industry layoffs, Huang says that the company probably needs about 10,000 more staff members. It makes sense for Huang and Nvidia to push their people into using AI. After all, it’s the reason that the once-gaming GPU maker has become the first company in the world to hit a $5-trillion market capitalization. But it’s just a tool that can enhance the productivity of employees, not something that should replace them entirely.

Title: XRP Spot ETFs Behind The Scenes – Here’s What Institutions Aren’t Saying Publicly
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-spot-etfs-behind-the-scenes/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T17:00:56Z

Following the launch of the historic XRP Spot ETFs, the community has been buzzing with excitement, triggering notable success for the funds over the next few days. As the exchange funds continue to attract significant inflows, a crypto expert has outlined the development that is unfolding behind the initiative. The Spot XRP ETFs are seeing robust growth, but what is happening behind the scenes is quite interesting and demands attention. Pumpius, a crypto expert and investor, has uncovered a subtle play among institutions that is not being shared with the general crowd. According to the expert, ETF fund managers are legally forbidden from purchasing XRP directly from payment firm Ripple or escrow. This is due to the court’s injunction that every single ETF must acquire the altcoin on the open market only, breaking the concept of shortcuts, backdoor deals, and wholesale buying. Pumpius has declared this underlying trend at the institutional level to be the most bullish step for the altcoin. His reason hinges on the fact that Ripple will only release what is absolutely necessary from the monthly escrow holdings. Furthermore, the payment firm will avoid causing taxable events this way by keeping the escrow untouched. Such a move would imply that Ripple is drip-feeding just enough liquidity to avoid dislocation while ETFs are actively absorbing circulating supply. The expert considers this pattern the calm before a structural supply shock, and not a sign of stagnation. When the shift happens, it will be seen as a balancing act, a pressure build-up, and a loading phase. In the meantime, fund managers are already in discussion with Ripple, which means timing coordination is currently ongoing. At the same time, the expert has highlighted that supply dynamics are now being designed in real time. Once the early balance period concludes and ETF demand continues to rise while escrow is strictly regulated, XRP will not move at a slow pace. Instead, the expert predicts that the altcoin will experience substantial movement, breaking upside resistance levels with violence. Spot XRP ETFs have become a serious mode of investment in the landscape since their launch. Franklin Templeton recently stunned the market by introducing the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca and referring to the token as “fundamental to the global settlement system.” Other major firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary Capital have all rolled out their own ETFs, which attracted millions in inflows from their first day. With the robust adoption and interest in the funds, the message is clear that the demand for regulated XRP exposure is bigger than anticipated. Despite the significant demand, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to jump into the funds, stating that customer demand is still primarily centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum for now. Furthermore, they believe that regulatory clarity is still not entirely certain despite repeated victories over the US SEC. However, if the company eventually launches its own fund, it would spur billions of capital and new institutional money. Considering its status in the finance sector, “a BlackRock ETF would be the ultimate stamp of approval.” For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

INTC stock today: Intel shares surged over 10% on Black Friday following analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's report suggesting the chipmaker could supply Apple's M-series processors. This potential partnership, with shipments possibly starting in 2027, has boosted investor sentiment and supports Apple's 'Made in USA' initiative, marking a positive turn for Intel Foundry Services.

Title: Uh-oh, accounting concerns circle the AI boom
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/28/uh-oh-accounting-concerns-circle-ai-boom/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T15:53:47Z

UPDATED 10:53 EST / NOVEMBER 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof As investors start to care about returns from all the spending on artificial intelligence, accounting is becoming a big topic of concern. In his Breaking Analysis this week, Dave Vellante makes the case that GPUs have plenty of legs, quelling most concerns that lengthening depreciation times are a red flag. That said, Meta is particularly, shall we say, creative, when it comes to accounting for, or not accounting for, its multibillion-dollar spending on data centers. Sharpening the concern over AI’s payoff is that the current generative approaches may soon reach their limit, as another AI expert opined this week. Still, the AI we’ve got so far will pack quite a punch. As Paul Gillin writes in his latest feature, agentic AI soon will software like a tidal wave. Meantime, it was full speed ahead this week on new models and tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and OpenAI, along with other activity. After Jeff Bezos scraped up some change under his couch cushions to raise $6.2 billion for his secretive industrial AI “startup” Project Prometheus, it turns out he has already made an acquisition. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev also raised $120 million for Harmonic AI to eliminate hallucinations. And AI is still helping enterprise tech providers, though to varying degrees. Dell and NetApp cleaned up on earnings, but HP fell short and announced thousands of layoffs, and Nutanix didn’t do so great either. Amazon Web Services will hold its annual re:Invent confab next week, and I’m not revealing anything by saying it will be all about AI. Fair or not, Amazon has a bit to prove it can catch up in that realm to OpenAI — which some observers speculate it will announce a deal with — as well as partner Anthropic, Microsoft and a surging Google. But this week it announced it will invest $50 billion to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for the U.S. government, so it’s hardly standing still. SiliconANGLE and theCUBE will be onsite at the event in Las Vegas with all the news, interviews and analysis. Next week there’s also a post-Thanksgiving glut of earnings from Salesforce, Snowflake, HPE, UiPath, CrowdStrike, Pure Storage and more that should provide further insight into the sustainability of the AI boom. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: The end of apps? Imagining software’s agentic future Breaking Analysis: Resetting GPU depreciation: Why AI factories bend, but don’t break, useful life assumptions It’s worrisome when accounting becomes a central issue in tech business, but here’s a good analysis of why new depreciation assumptions are one of the biggest problems. AI meets aggressive accounting at Meta’s gigantic new data center (per the Wall Street Journal) This is pretty damning, especially coming from the reporter who first broke the iffy accounting at Enron back in 2000. Worth a careful read. “Artificial intelligence, meet artificial accounting.” Ouch! Ilya Sutskever declares the scaling era dead. His $3B bet says research will win Another AI pioneer weighs in, following Yann LeCun last week. Hmm. If scaling isn’t the key, who needs all those data centers? Jeff Bezos’ Project Prometheus reportedly acquires AI startup General Agents Harmonic AI raises $120M at $1.45B valuation to advance mathematical reasoning Financial AI startup Model ML nabs $75M investment Snowflake to acquire Select Star to expand Horizon Catalog’s view of enterprise data for next-gen AI Overstory closes $43M round to scale AI-driven wildfire prevention and grid resilience Cerrion raises $18M to support industrial automation with intelligent vision agents Momentic raises $15M to become the AI-era ‘source of truth’ for software quality Procure AI lands $13M in funding to automate business procurement tasks Kovant wants to become the nerve center of enterprise agentic AI operations after pre-seed funding Anthropic releases new flagship Claude Opus 4.5 model Microsoft debuts Fara-7B, a small ‘computer-use’ model that runs natively on PCs OpenAI debuts ChatGPT Shopping Research tool for personalized product discovery Amplitude lays out AI-native future as brands adapt to generative search SUSE’s MCP Server tech preview lays foundation for AI-assisted Linux infrastructure Arcade.dev and Anthropic advance MCP with new secure authorization flow Warner Music inks Suno deal amid cooling tensions over AI-generated music There’s even more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Amazon announces $50B investment to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for US government Nvidia shares drop on report Meta may buy AI chips from Google Nuclear energy startup X-energy raises $700M in funding Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance NetApp raises its full-year earnings and revenue forecast and its stock rises Dismal revenue outlook crushes optimism around Nutanix and its stock tanks Workday falls in late trading as growth outlook fails to excite investors Zscaler reports strong quarter but cautious guidance weighs on shares Zoom tops estimates with stronger enterprise sales and higher AI adoption Autodesk earnings and revenue beat estimates, shares up 6% PagerDuty earnings surpass estimates but stock falls 5% Intel shares jump 10% on report of potential chip production deal with Apple Chip startup Rapidus reportedly plans to build 1.4-nanometer fab Kneron’s new AI chip brings LLM performance out of the cloud and onto devices Firefly AI says it can make apps almost invulnerable to cloud outages Mercy Ships, Presidio and Cisco partner at the intersection technology and purpose Google drops EU antitrust complaint against Microsoft amid cloud probe EU moves to ban social media for kids under 16 who don’t have parents’ consent We have lots more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps ServiceNow could reportedly acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1B+ Prominent tech executives back $36M round for cybersecurity startup Clover Security Opti lands $20M to automate enterprise identity governance with AI Agentic resiliency startup Vijil raises $17M to safeguard AI agents continuously Mixpanel breach compromises some OpenAI API users’ account data New ‘HashJack’ technique lets attackers manipulate AI assistants in Comet, Copilot and Gemini Oligo report uncovers critical Fluent Bit flaws exposing cloud workloads Amazon details internal ATA cybersecurity automation system Veeam makes the case for AI resilience Hack The Box debuts HTB AI Range to test AI and human cyber defense side by side Trend Micro previews security package for full-stack AI protection Superwise expands agentic governance platform with new real-time guardrails More cybersecurity news here Digital bank Klarna launches stablecoin amidst rising crypto adoption Paxos acquires crypto wallet startup Fordefi for $100M+ Gravis Robotics raises $23M to integrate AI into earthmoving equipment Execs say OpenAI has first hardware prototypes, plan to reveal device in two years or less And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Network digital twin technology firm Forward Networks appointed Bobby Condon chief revenue officer.

Title: Amundi, Europe’s biggest asset manager, tokenises money market fund on Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amundi-europes-biggest-asset-manager-tokenises-money-market-fund-on-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T15:01:44Z
Full Content:
European asset management giant Amundi has taken a major step into the digital finance era by launching the first tokenised share of its AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokenised fund marks a significant innovation in fund distribution and allows investors to hold fund units digitally while maintaining the traditional channels for accessing the fund. According to Amundi, the tokenised fund is built in collaboration with CACEIS, one of Europe’s leading asset-servicing providers. CACEIS supplies the technology infrastructure required for tokenisation, including digital wallets for investors and a blockchain-based order platform that supports subscriptions and redemptions. Jean-Pierre Michalowski, CEO of CACEIS, highlighted that the hybrid transfer agent service opens a new distribution channel, allowing clients to quickly and efficiently execute fund transactions via blockchain while paving the way for potential future operations in stablecoins or central bank digital currencies. The first transaction of the tokenised share took place on November 4, 2025, and the fund is now distributed through a hybrid model. This means that investors can continue to use conventional methods, but the new digital option enables fund units to be recorded as tokens on Ethereum, providing secure, transparent, and traceable transaction records. Blockchain technology provides multiple advantages for both investors and fund managers. Orders can be executed instantly, operations can continue around the clock, and transactions are recorded with full transparency. The tokenised model also opens the fund to younger and more digitally oriented investors, reflecting a shift in investor behaviour toward faster, more accessible financial products. Amundi emphasised that the launch does not replace traditional fund access but instead provides an additional route for investors. The hybrid approach ensures that the fund remains inclusive, combining the reliability of conventional distribution with the efficiency and innovation offered by blockchain technology. Jean-Jacques Barbéris, Head of Institutional and Corporate Clients and ESG at Amundi, described asset tokenisation as a global transformation set to accelerate in the coming years, with this initiative serving as a practical demonstration of the firm’s expertise in implementing secure and robust blockchain applications in finance. The launch comes amid a broader expansion of tokenised real-world assets. Market data shows that the value of tokenised assets on blockchains rose sharply in 2025, from $15.2 billion at the beginning of the year to $37.1 billion by late November. Ethereum, where Amundi’s fund is hosted, ranks second globally in the tokenised real-world asset space with a market cap of $12.4 billion. The trend reflects increasing institutional interest in blockchain-based investment solutions and the mainstreaming of digital finance innovations. Tokenised money market funds, in particular, have seen rapid adoption in recent years. Industry data indicates that products from leading firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton now manage billions in digital assets, while total value locked in tokenised funds surged from around $770 million at the end of 2023 to nearly $9 billion by October 2025. Amundi’s launch positions it as a front-runner in Europe, showcasing its commitment to leveraging digital innovation while maintaining robust regulatory and operational standards.

Title: Biggest Black Friday 2025 Sales on Disney Stuff!

Time Published: 2025-11-28T13:14:37Z

Black Friday 2025 has officially arrived, with great deals on all sorts of Disney stuff–LEGOs, Loungefly, books, Christmas decor, collectibles, travel accessories, gadgets, tech, and more! This list rounds up the best sales on items for your Walt Disney World vacations, or that will make great gifts for the fans on your holiday gift-giving list. Although it’s finally the real Black Friday, retailers started the sale season over a month ago. We’ve been sharing deals, and have been inundated with emails from retailers and our favorite dealhunting sites about super sales for the holiday shopping season. Of course, not all deals are created equal–some “special” offers are simply marketing–but many discounts are actually quite good this year! That’s where this post comes into play–separating the cream of the crop from the marketing fluff to bring you the best deals related to Disney and travel! In this post, I’ve aggregated the best deals–some of which are Disney-specific, whereas others are non-Disney items. This includes a lot of fun items for collectors, parents, people doing gift shopping, plus things that will be useful for Walt Disney World or Disneyland vacations… If you want a broader selection of the current deals, check out Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page for the biggest savings and most popular deals. Even then, the options can be overwhelming, as there are literally tens of thousands of items on sale. If you’re not already a member, click here for a FREE 30-day Amazon Prime trial membership. For this list, we’ve combed through the various deals on Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page and are sharing only those we deem good. We receive a small commission from Amazon for your purchases, so buying through these links helps support the site. However, neither the price you pay nor our recommendations (or lack thereof) are impacted by that. Many things on sale for Black Friday are also on our Christmas Gift Guide for Disney Fans or our Ultimate Walt Disney World Packing List, so double win! Even without special offers, those are great ways to get your holiday shopping started–or create your own Christmas list. On with the list of the Best Amazon Black Friday Sale deals for 2025, first with the top picks followed by various categories… Bose QuietComfort Wireless Headphones — At 43% off and “selling fast” according to Amazon, this is one of the hottest deals of Black Friday. Sarah has owned two pairs of Bose QuietComfort headphones, which should speak volumes about what she thinks of them. They are spectacular, worth every penny, and way better than Beats or Sony headphones. The noise cancelling is perfect for flights, public transit, or just trying to work and maintain focus. The only downside is the large size. Fire 8 Kids Tablet – Even if you strive to be screen-free, this can be a lifesaver on flights or in other meltdown scenarios. This tablet for kids has parental controls, goal-setting, time limits, plus 1 FREE year of Amazon Kids+ with access to tons of educational content from PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Disney, and more. This tablet is 54% off–plenty of others are 50% to 55% off as part of the up to 60% off Amazon devices deal (Ring cameras, Kindle readers, Echos, Fires, etc). Travel White Noise Machine – We actually bought this for traveling with our baby as it was recommended by countless parenting blogs. As it turns out, this is just great for traveling in general. That’s doubly true at Walt Disney World, where I swear that even Deluxe Resorts have paper-thin walls. Save 50%+ on Crocs – This is one of the best deals on Crocs we’ve seen in a while, and it’s on a wide variety of styles–including some non-hideous ones! Great for wearing around the house or garden, or Disney, I guess, if you think this looks good. Be sure to check for the “save 10% with brand promotion” deal sweetener on a couple of Crocs. Stokke YOYO3 Stroller – This is the Cadillac of strollers…or would be if Cadillacs were known as lightweight and nimble travel vehicles. This stroller is worth every penny, with great handling and ease of use. Most importantly, it’s incredibly light, easy to use, and folds down incredibly compact–small enough to fit in an overhead bin. We’ve tried a lot of strollers, but this is the only one we love that is perfect for travel to Walt Disney World and beyond. 20% off may not seem great, but this stroller only goes on sale once per year–on Black Friday. This is the cheapest you’ll ever see it. Playstation 5 Console – Take $100 off the Playstation 5, including various bundles (can’t go wrong with the Ghost of Yotei option). Most Disney-aged kids are going to be much better suited by the Nintendo Switch 2, but this is a great deal on the PS5, and older fans (like…my age) might favor the horsepower here. Philips GoZero Insulated Water Bottle — This insulated metal GoZero bottle by Philips has great reviews–it’s durable, BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and uses a 2-stage activated carbon filter reduces odor, chlorine and leaves zero aftertaste. 36% off for Black Friday, albeit as a Lightning Deal (so might be dead by the time you see this). Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers – This one ended up on my “for you” Black Friday deals page, which I thought was amusing given what I wrote in Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks. Guess Big Tech isn’t always listening…or they just think I must want this because I’ve been researching it a lot. (Either way, not an actual recommendation–even if it is supposedly a popular deal.) LEGO Disney Cruella De Vil’s Car – detailed buildable replica of Cruella’s infamous car is packed with authentic features, including opening doors, a removable roof for expanded play access, and steering using the spare wheel at the back of the vehicle. This is 30% off for Black Friday, and according to Amazon it is “selling fast.” LEGO Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Battle Droid – Honestly had no idea they were still making new Phantom Menace toys (or is it a nostalgia play?). Perhaps that’s why this is on sale for 36% off, but that wouldn’t explain the “selling fast” part of the deal. LEGO Disney Frozen Advent Calendar (2025) – At 47% off, this is a scorching hot deal–the kind that will sell out via Amazon, and only be available from third party sellers for double the cost. Megatron is already a huge Frozen fan, but she’s still too young for this, so it’ll be something we hold for a couple of years. LEGO Disney Frozen Elsa’s Ice Palace – This buildable Disney Frozen toy features a 3-level ice palace with a tower, Elsa, Anna and Kristoff LEGO Disney mini-doll figures and an Olaf snowman figure. This is a stellar deal at 44% off–don’t wait for Black Friday on this one! LEGO Disney and Pixar ‘Up’ House – This 598-piece LEGO Disney toy set includes a partial house built with balloons, different rooms and functions, plus Carl Fredricksen and Russell LEGO minifigures, and a Dug LEGO dog figure for dog lovers. Good deal at 37% off. Lenox 2025 Disney Christmas Ornaments – There are several Lenox Christmas ornaments (and other decor) on sale for Black Friday, from this Mickey Mouse to Cinderella Castle! Hallmark Elsa Ornament – This doesn’t strike me as the normal Hallmark style, but it’s a cute ornament and looks reasonably high quality. Good deal. Thomas Kinkade Candy Cane Express Christmas Puzzle – It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but we love the Kinkade art style. It’s warm and cozy, even a bit schmaltzy. Comforting like a Hallmark movie, a good sweater, or a cup of coffee by the fireplace. Thomas Kinkade Disney Dreams 2026 Wall Calendar – This calendar is a must-buy every single year, and that’s doubly true for 2026 with Frozen cover art and it being 38% off for Black Friday! Moana 2 BD+DVD+Digital Combo – Is physical media making a comeback now that streaming keeps raising its prices? If so, this set at 60% off is a great deal! Get 3 for the Price of 2 – This is a deal Amazon does each year for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with rotating products. Here’s how to take advantage: Here are our top recommendations for the 3 for 2 deal in order to maximize savings: These are all great options because every single one is an excellent book (or set of books) that’s a must-own for Disney fans. They’re also all on sale by significant amounts even before the 3 for 2 deal. Finally, they’re all priced around $30, which allows you to maximize your savings. (You don’t want to pick two ~$30 books and a $12 one, because the last one is the free one!) The Unofficial Disney Parks Cookbooks Box Set – Don’t let “unofficial” fool you. While not made by Disney, these are the definitive cookbooks from the parks and are fan-favorites. 54% off. I’m also seeing a promo to “Save $22.08 on 3 select items.” I can’t figure out how to tell which items are eligible, and this might be targeted, but I plan on adding a bunch of stuff to my cart later today and seeing what happens. Wish me luck. The Unofficial Disney Parks Holiday Cookbooks – Same idea here, but with holiday foods! Get it now for 56% off. Maps of the Disney Parks — This is a staple of our gift-giving guides, and that’s in part because it looks really nice, making it an eye-catching gift. This also has a “Save $21.03 on 3 select items” notice. Interestingly, the amounts are different between the products. Sukeen Cooling Towel 4-Pack – The cooling system on these towels uses moisture from the towel to draw the sweat away from your skin to keep you cool. We still prefer the Frogg Toggs Chilly Pad, but some Walt Disney World fans favor these. You can probably wait out this deal; these things are always on sale. JoyJolt Disney Mickey Mouse 3D Glass Cups Set of 2 – JoyJolt Disney coffee cups aren’t your regular double walled glasses. Look inside and you’ll discover Disney’s Mickey Mouse inside your coffee in optical 3D. Great deal at 40%! Mickey Pants and Minnie Skirt 3D Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups – Same story here with these coffee cups. Note that you can toggle between two sizes here, too. Only the smaller size is a great deal. (Another larger option is the JoyJolt Mickey & Pluto Sketch Art Mugs, also on sale for 20% off.) Simple Modern Disney Kids Tumbler – Two of Megatron’s biggest obsessions are cups and Minnie/Mickey Mouse. And of course, she wants huge cups–not kid-sized ones–because that’s what mom and dad use! Predictably, things go terribly wrong when we let her use our Tervises. This spill-proof 24 ounce stainless steel tumbler looks like a great alternative…and this type of cup is all the rage now, right? Corkcicle x Disney Minnie Mouse Tumbler – You should recognize the Corkcicle name from their partnership with Walt Disney World and sponsoring of many EPCOT events. At 30% off for a larger and nicer-looking cup, this seems like a better deal than the previous entry. Serenity Kids Baby Food Pouches – Several readers have asked what Megatron eats in the parks. By and large, this is the answer. On sale for Black Friday. Cerebelly Baby Food Pouches – And this, which is also on sale for Black Friday. FuelRod 2-Pack – Did you ever think you’d see the day when Disney Tourist Blog dot com was actively endorsing this controversial charger? Well, we just did. An exceptional deal was involved that helped make up our minds in favor of the new and improved device. There’s actually a FuelRod 3-Pack on sale that’s an even better deal on a per unit basis–it just comes down to whether you need three of them (I’d say that’s the smart move for families, but solo travelers or couples should be fine with two.) FuelRod MAX10 – The newest swappable device is not a rod at all, but rather, a brick. This is their biggest and fastest charger, and a great deal after clipping the coupon on the product page. FuelRod – This is the weakest deal on a per unit basis, but it might make sense to get your feet wet with just one FuelRod before buying multiples. Not what we recommend, but still a solid deal! 25% Off Amazon Warehouse Deals/Resale – Not a specific deal, but rather, up to 25% off one Amazon Resale purchase (exact savings varies by category). We buy a lot of stuff this way, as what’s meant by resale is actually returns. This was actually a better deal last week when early Black Friday sales started. It was 30% off then, had more item eligibility, and there was greater selection–a lot sold out during that deal. Still, 25% off is better than nothing, and some items have been restocked. Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W Portable Charger with Built-in USB-C Cable for Travel – This charger is–without a doubt–the charger we’d buy if we had phones with a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning connector. This one is 23% off for Black Friday Week. Also available in 20k capacity. Anker 24,000mAh Power Bank 3-Port Portable Charger with 140W Output – For those who really go hard playing the Lightning Lane refresh game. An okay deal at 32% off, but don’t be surprised if it’s cheaper on Cyber Monday. There’s also the newer version that’s 35% off and supposedly “selling fast.” Anker 3-Port 140W Charging Block – This is a niche product, but it’s another game-changer for me. This Anker 3-port block charges my Nikon mirrorless camera, laptop, and phone simultaneously and the device is smaller than my Macbook charger by itself. I just upgraded to this during Prime Day from the prior generation–I’ve been very happy with both. Great deal at 40% off! Anker 47W Nano 3 USB-C Charger – This is what Sarah uses, and it’s absolutely perfect for her–or the average person. It’ll charge your devices faster than the standard charger (and lightyears quicker than in-wall ports at WDW hotels), and it’s 40% off for Black Friday. I believe this is the cheapest it’s ever been. Anker PowerPort Cube Strip with 3 Outlets and 3 USB Ports – Disney has refurbished many of its rooms, adding USB ports in the process, but many of them don’t work–or don’t work well. Plus, this has fast-charging to get devices recharged quicker and USB-C. There are a ton of other Anker products on sale as part of the Black Friday deals, but that’s usually the case with sales like this. One new-to-me sale is this Anker Portable Generator, which isn’t even a product that I realized they made. Obviously not for Disney (unless you’re a Fort Wilderness camper!), but intriguing at 56% off! Gonex Compression Packing Cubes – They key here is that these are compression packing cubes, which normally cost more and will save you even more space when packing. If you need the suitcase space, we recommend this set over the one below. Be sure to clip the coupon for more off. Gonex Packable Backpack — Another excellent innovation from the fine folks at Gonex…a brand I’ve literally never heard of outside the ‘packable’ space. This takes up minimal room in your suitcase and more importantly is super lightweight. That minimizes the amount of back-sweat you’ll have to endure from the Florida heat and humidity. Be sure to clip the coupon–that’s the only way this is a deal. Gonex Packable Duffel Bag – I swear this post isn’t sponsored by Gonex. It just happens that we have a lot of their products because they’re often deeply discounted on Amazon’s various deal days. In this case, we use the packable duffel whenever traveling internationally to bring home everything we buy. And not just Disney stuff. Thanks to the strength of the dollar, we stock up on everything. During a recent trip to Japan, we went antiquing and thrifting, and I also dropped a ridiculous amount at UNIQLO. On the plus side, I won’t have to buy socks or undershirts for the next few years! Personal Neck Fan – We bought this little device a couple years ago, and it’s shockingly effective. It’s like that refreshing feeling you get when walking past an open doorway of an air-conditioned building. It’s not perfect, but it’s a really fantastic idea, and is a breath of fresh air during hot and humid days in Florida (which is ~10 months of the year). Handheld Portable Small Fan (USB Chargeable) – If you don’t want to be quite as dorky with the neck fan and don’t want to wear a cooling towel, this classic handheld fan is the more traditional option for keeping cool. It ends up being under $10 after discount and clipping the coupon on the product page. Packing Cube Sets (Multiple Sizes) – Another staple of our packing list, we are fans of packing cubes and these are a solid deal. (With that said, there are a LOT of packing cubes on sale, so you might want to browse the results for “packing cubes” on the Amazon Black Friday page and see which sizes/colors/etc. best suit you.) Loungefly Pumpking Minnie Mouse Backpack – This is one of several Loungefly backpacks that’s 50% off. A cute bag at a great price, so long as you don’t mind holding onto it for ~9 months. Loungefly Organizer – I can’t imagine why you’d want to reduce the amount of usable space in your already small backpack, but I’m told this is very popular. And on sale for Black Friday. Knockoff Loungefly Bag – Calling a spade a spade, this is basically a bootleg Loungefly bag. Now, I am definitely NOT the target audience for such a product, but as someone who doesn’t “get” how on earth Loungeflys are so expensive, I think this is a far, far superior option! More Loungefly Black Friday Deals – Lots of other Loungefly products on sale, including several more Disney items…some of which are kinda ugly TBH. 12 Beloved Disney Classic Little Golden Books (Boxed Set) – This is one of two Disney Little Golden Book box sets that are on sale for deep discounts. This is truly classics, with one-dozen Walt Disney Little Golden Books originally published in the 1950s and 1960s. This one is 62% off, making each title $2.25! Ultimate Princess Boxed Set of 12 Little Golden Books – This is 47% off! 3 for 2 Little Golden Books – There are actually a ton more options as part of that sale–here’s a full rundown of titles. Bedtime Favorites Storybook Collection – With 18 stories and 250 illustrations, this is a great option for bedtime reading to little ones. Disney Princess Cookbook – From Rapunzel’s Frying Pan Eggs to Ariel’s Sea Turtle Cupcakes, this beautiful cookbook is filled with delicious recipes inspired by the Princesses’ many adventures. Disney Storybook Collection — A large, 300+ page hardcover book retelling several classic Disney stories complete with 250 pieces of artwork from the Disney Archives. Walt Disney’s Disneyland — One of my favorite Disneyland books of all-time at a crazy-good price. Anyone who has owned or even held a TASCHEN book knows why this is something special. This is an incredibly high-quality coffee table book, and well worth more than price. Holiday Magic at the Disney Parks: Celebrations Around the World — This is an incredible deep dive into the holidays (mostly Christmas and Halloween, but also Easter and other seasonal events) with great photos, detailed information, and rich history. If you love the seasonal events, this is an absolute must-own. Poster Art of the Disney Parks, Second Edition – This new title is an expanded and updated edition of the beloved book that ranks highly in our library. The second edition renders the first obsolete, as the 85+ new posters and behind-the-scenes development info nearly doubles the book in length. It’s worth it for all of the awesome new posters made for EPCOT’s reimagining alone. Okay, that’s it for right now. There are a bunch of other great deals that are irrelevant to Disney and travel (but also don’t appeal to me) on the Amazon Black Friday Sale homepage. We recommend browsing for yourself a bit, and checking back often, as new deals are regularly appearing–and disappearing. Just be mindful of the fact that some of these offers are time-sensitive, so you don’t want to spend too much time procrastinating and end up losing out! Be sure to check back here throughout the coming days, as I’ll share new discounts and more Lightning Deals as they become available.

Title: 6 companies that have signaled they are replacing human employees with AI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/list-companies-replacing-human-employees-with-ai-layoffs-workforce-reductions
Time Published: 2025-11-28T13:02:04Z
Full Content:
Worries about AI one day replacing human workers have intensified in recent years — and as it turns out, that future has already arrived. MIT just released a study that found that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labor market. The study utilized a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which models 151 million US workers and measures how AI overlaps with skills in each occupation. As AI starts to replace human workers, companies have been increasingly open about the role AI adoption is playing in recent layoffs. However, while some companies have directly cited AI as a reason for workforce reductions, others have vacillated with their messaging, leaving ambiguity around the exact reasoning and whether AI is directly replacing workers. Even as some companies replace human workers with AI, they might end up hiring more people in other roles because of it. A World Economic Forum survey found that 41% of companies globally are expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of AI. Meanwhile, tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are expected to double by 2030, the WEF said. Here's a list of companies that are replacing — or signaling they may replace — humans with AI. HP said it's reducing the size of its corporate workforce as a result of AI initiatives. In an earnings report on Tuesday, the company said it plans to cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by the end of 2028, estimating the changes would save around $1 billion. HP's earnings presentation said part of its strategy was to cut costs through "workforce reductions, platform simplification, programs consolidation, and productivity measures" and to increase customer satisfaction, innovation, and productivity with "artificial intelligence adoption and enablement." Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that it had replaced hundreds of human resources employees with AI. More recently, the company announced in November that it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter of 2025, affecting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce." Its CEO, Arvind Krishna, said the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. He also said the company plans to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. Krishna has also said AI adoption has led to the company hiring more employees in programming and sales. In 2023, Krishna told Bloomberg that IBM had halted or slowed hiring for back-office roles, like in human resources, that could be replaced by AI. "I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period," he told the outlet at the time. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink the retail giant's workforce in the coming years — but when the company announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs in October, Jassy said the cuts were about culture, not AI. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said in the company's most recent earnings call. "It really — it's culture." An Amazon spokesperson also reiterated to Business Insider that the cuts were not driven by AI. When the layoffs were announced, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology wrote in a blog post that the move reflected a continued effort to run the company "like the world's largest startup." The SVP, Beth Galetti, also referenced a need to be leaner in the age of AI. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before," Galetti wrote in the post. In an episode of "The Logan Bartlett Show" released in August, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company was using AI agents in the customer support division to replace humans and help the company work through more sales leads. "I was able to rebalance my head count on my support," he said in the interview. "I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads." A Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider that Benioff was referencing an organizational transformation that took place over several months to reshape its customer support function. After deploying Agentforce, the company no longer needed to "actively backfill support engineer roles," the spokesperson said, adding that it successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas of the company, like professional services, sales, and customer success. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in 2024 that the company could operate effectively with half its current staff. A spokesperson for the company said its AI assistant now handles the equivalent workload of 853 full-time agents, up from 700 at launch. That's saving an estimated $58 million annually, the spokesperson said. After its CEO acknowledged that previous cost-cutting measures had gone too far, the buy-now-pay-later firm redeployed workers to customer support roles. However, the spokesperson said that Siemiatkowski's comments were in reference to outsourced support quality, not limitations of AI. The recent in-house hires were a "tiny pilot" of under 10 people aimed at improving the quality of outsourced agents, not replacing AI, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the company never removed human support entirely, and it still works with outsourced teams of around 2,000. Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of Fiverr, said in September that the company was slashing roughly 30% of its workforce. The cut would affect about 250 team members, and the freelancing platform had 762 full-time employees as of 2024, according to an SEC filing. The CEO said that the cuts were needed to help turn Fiverr into a leaner and faster "AI-first company." Kaufman said in a staff memo in April that AI was "coming for your jobs," and in May, he told Business Insider that Fiverr would only hire people who know how to use AI. "If you don't ensure that you sharpen your knives, you're going to be left behind. It's that simple," Kaufman said. Jump to

Black Friday 2025 Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Absolute Best Deals Kindle Deals Headphone Deals Apple Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Sleep Deals Tech Deals Now Reading Toy Deals Black Friday may have come and gone, but the deals are still kicking in the lead-up to Cyber Monday. In theory, this is the time of the year when retailers heavily discount old stock to make room for the new, but finding actual tech deals on gear worth buying can be trickier than expected. Welcome to WIRED’s guide to the best Black Friday tech deals, where we can promise you two things: these devices are worth buying (we’ve tested and recommended every one of them), and these are actual discounts (not the year-round price). So, whether you need an upgrade, want to treat yourself, or are seeking a great gift, we have you covered. Want a wider range of deals? Check out the Absolute Best Black Friday Deals roundup to find more bargains this sale weekend. Updated November 29: We've added the Sony A7 IV Camera, Pixel 9a, Soundcore by Anker Aeroclip, Fitbit Ace LTE, Tonies Toniebox, and Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Google Pixel 10 is one of the best Android phones you can buy. Easy to recommend at full price, the Pixel 10 is an absolute bargain with this discount. You get an excellent triple-camera system with a 5X optical zoom sensor, support for Qi2 wireless charging, so you can magnetically attach to wireless chargers and docks, and Google’s super smart software features (Call Screen to filter out spam calls is our favorite). Learn more in the Best Pixel Phones guide. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top smartphone choice for most people, and it's now $50 cheaper than it was on Black Friday itself. At $349, you're getting a smooth-performing smartphone with a reliable dual-camera system that's unmatched at this price, not to mention day-long battery life and a completely flat camera lens system for anyone who hates giant camera bumps. Oh, and it'll get 7 years of software updates. Sony Amazon B&H Photo Adorama Sony's A7 IV is the best mirrorless camera on the market (for most people). It's a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera with a brilliant autofocus system, impressive dynamic range, and crisp images. There's an expansive range of 4K video options as well, along with customizable buttons to set up your preferences, so you don't have to always rummage through the menus. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson found the grip to be super comfortable and the camera to be light enough to endure for long periods without any back strain. —Boutayna Chokrane Soundcore by Anker Amazon Soundcore If you're shopping for open earbuds so that you can enjoy your music but still be aware of your surroundings, the Soundcore Aeroclip is the best we've tested so far. Reviewer Ryan Waniata praises the comfort, sound quality, usability, and value. The sound is wide and balanced, and the built-in controls are ideal for runs. Waniata likes to use them during outdoor activities, like hiking or biking, but he finds them especially helpful when he's cooking dinner and needs to stay alert for his newborn's cries. —Boutayna Chokrane Fitbit Amazon Best Buy Editor Adrienne So says the Fitbit Ace LTE is the first fitness tracker she's gotten her kids to use. It's a fitness tracker (designed with Fitbit's health sensors), gaming device, and location tracker. The $10/monthly subscription includes both LTE connectivity and Fitbit Arcade, which has a variety of movement-based games that get children on their feet and incentivize them to keep their watches on. They can call and text their guardians (and other approved contacts) through the Fitbit Ace app, and their location is trackable via Google Find My. —Boutayna Chokrane Philips Hue Amazon Best Buy This is a rare and tasty deal on my favorite Xmas lights. They work indoors or out, can be scheduled, and support a bunch of lovely animated effects. While I'm mentioning Philips Hue and its excellent but horribly expensive wares, you might want to check out some of its other Black Friday deals. My picks would be the wall washers ($316), TV lightstrip ($129), and HDMI sync box ($270). Asus Amazon Asus Walmart B&H The Asus RT-BE58U is perhaps the ideal Wi-Fi 7 upgrade for modest homes and apartments still struggling with the crappy router their internet service provider sent, and that's why it tops our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide. It’s easy to set up and use, can cover up to 2,000 square feet, and boasts plenty of ports. As a dual-band router, it lacks the 6-GHz band, but has all the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7. There’s also support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh. Satechi Best Buy Amazon Satechi B&H Photo Don't ask me why they keep taking our ports away. God forbid you should want to plug something into your laptop. Well, you can stick it to those minimalist designers with the best laptop docking station. This one doubles as a wedge to prop your laptop up and has a storage slot. Sony Amazon Walmart B&H Photo These wireless noise-canceling headphones may not be the latest release from Sony, but they are still an excellent pair of cans with a far deeper discount. The Sony WH-1000XM5 are relatively light and comfortable, producing accomplished sound in every scenario, and have great control options. TCL Amazon Best Buy Costco You can spend a lot on a TV, but you can also get a great screen without breaking the bank, and the TCL QM6K proves it. This is the best TV for most people right now as it offers excellent color and processing, all the apps you want, and great performance, even in bright rooms. There are discounts across the range of screen sizes. Roku Amazon Walmart If you want to get the latest streaming apps on an older TV, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is for you. It’s easy to set up, works reliably, and has a handy voice remote that makes finding content easier than ever. It slots neatly behind most TVs, and Roku’s interface is nice and clear. Apple Amazon Walmart Best Buy Apple Apple doesn’t really do sales, but other retailers do. This is the lowest price we’ve seen on a solid iPad the whole family can enjoy. The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) performs great for most tasks, looks pretty nice, and has a 12-megapixel camera. It is honestly all the iPad most folks need for surfing the web and streaming shows in bed. With iPadOS 26 and the new windowing apps feature, you can even comfortably do some work if you pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Nimble Amazon (Medium) Amazon (Small) Amazon (Large) Nimble (All) Handy as they are for keeping you connected when your phone dies unexpectedly, portable chargers can be very same-y. The reason the Nimble Champ tops our Best Power Banks guide is Nimble’s focus on the environment. It’s made from 90 percent certified recycled plastic and comes in fully biodegradable packaging. It also works well, with capacities starting from 5,200 mAh, with USB-A and USB-C ports, and up to 15-watt charging. Amazon Amazon Amazon (Signature) Yes, you should read more, and Amazon’s Kindle e-readers make it easier to do exactly that. Our current favorite is the Kindle Paperwhite (12th generation). It has a sharp 7-inch display, auto-adjusting warm light, three-month battery life, snappy performance, and it’s slim and light, making it comfortable to hold. It even has integration with Overdrive for your library books and support for several languages. reMarkable Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio) ReMarkable (with Marker Plus) ReMarkable (With Marker) The reMarkable 2 is one of the best digital notebooks, offering a paper-like writing experience, intuitive software, and several weeks of battery life. This is a budget model, so it lacks front light and color, but it’s still a decent device. Bundles where you choose both a marker and folio are heavily discounted right now, and they’re not often on sale, so it’s a good time to snap one up. Keychron Amazon Keychron Keychron boards are popular here at WIRED, and the Q6 HE is our current pick of the best mechanical keyboards. Sturdy, satisfying to type on, with a lovely retro aesthetic, what more do you need? Well, the Q6 HE also boasts hot-swappable Hall Effect switches, four macro keys, and is relatively easy to customize or repair. Nomad Nomad Amazon The great thing about Nomad’s 65-watt charger is that it’s incredibly slim, with flip-out prongs, so it can slip easily into small pockets in your bag or purse. You get dual USB-C ports, and can pull 45 watts out of the left port and 20 out of the right. Or, if you’re just charging one device, the full 65 watts is enough for any phone, most tablets, and even some MacBooks or Windows laptops (though they may not charge at top speed). Anthbot Amazon Anthbot You know what I don't miss in the slightest? Mowing the lawn. A good robot mower, like this relatively affordable one from newcomer Anthbot, will do it for you, quietly. No wire required; it recharges itself, you just set a schedule and relax. OK, it sometimes leaves a verge, but the only model I've tried that doesn't is more than twice the price. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Sharp 2K video, color night vision, a wide 160-degree field of view, and clear two-way audio make the Arlo Pro 5S easy to recommend for folks seeking a security camera. You also get AI recognition for people and pets, a siren to scare intruders, and the quick-loading Arlo app. But you need Arlo Secure ($8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. The Arlo Pro 5S is our pick of the best outdoor security cameras. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy I love my Oura Ring 4. It accurately tracks my sleep, activity, and stress levels and offers insights that I find genuinely useful.

Ray-Ban Amazon Ray-Ban Meta Yes, there is a new version of the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, but the good news is that the old pair is now on sale. If you can stomach Meta AI’s privacy policies, there’s a strong argument that it has won the smart glasses race already (at least, so far).

The crypto industry rushed to the aid of Hong Kong residents who suffered the city’s most devastating fire in 80 years, claiming the lives of at least 128 people. Some of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges and Web3 companies have pledged millions of dollars to support victims of the deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po District, highlighting the sector’s growing role in real-world relief efforts. Three centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) have publicly pledged to donate $24.78 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.19 million) to aid the victims of the devastating fire, which claimed the lives of at least 128 residents. The donations included $1.5 million from Bitget exchange, $1.28 million from Binance, and about $256,000 from KuCoin exchange. Bitget contributed the largest share, aiming to support reconstruction and recovery in the affected community, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said Friday on X, adding that the exchange “stands with Hong Kong, wishing affected residents a swift recovery and rebuilding of their homes.” The two-day fire began on Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court complex and spread to seven high-rise buildings before being extinguished on Friday, in what the media have described as Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in 80 years. Related: BlackRock ETF investors bounce back to profit as price reclaims $90K Hong Kong-based Web3 intellectual property company Animoca Brands has also started a token-based fundraiser, aiming to collect funds from the crypto community via an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a Solana (SOL) wallet address. The fundraiser is collecting donations until Dec. 2. The company pledged to convert 100% of the proceeds to Hong Kong dollars by Dec. 3, to support the relief efforts of the Hong Kong Red Cross. For transparency, Animoca will post a donation receipt showing the final amount collected and donated, the company said in a Thursday announcement. Animoca’s EVM-compatible wallet had collected $171,000 while its Solana wallet collected $1,500 in cryptocurrency donations at the time of writing, according to cryptocurrency intelligence platform Nansen. Tron Network founder Justin Sun also pledged an undisclosed amount to the fire victims. Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say Cryptocurrency-based donations have emerged as a significant lifeline for disaster-stricken regions and underdeveloped economies lacking banking infrastructure. In 2024, crypto donations surpassed $1 billion, driven by large-scale transfers to the victims of the earthquake in Thailand and Myanmar. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao alone donated nearly $600,000 to the disaster relief fund in April 2024, following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Thailand and Myanmar on March 28. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also been known for his crypto donations. In October 2024, Buterin donated over $180,000 in Ether (ETH) to the biotech charity Kanro.

Title: Google's AI Progress Drives MediaTek To Best Week Since 2002
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/googles-ai-progress-drives-mediatek-to-best-week-since-2002

MediaTek Inc. shares posted their best week since 2002, as artificial intelligence advances at its client Google help reshape the growth outlook for the Taiwanese chipmaker. The stock rose for a fifth-straight day Friday in Taipei, taking its weekly gain to 22%, on investor enthusiasm over Google’s latest Gemini model and AI chip deals. MediaTek has reportedly partnered with the Alphabet Inc. unit on design of tensor processing units, seen as a potential rival to Nvidia Corp. chips in AI applications. Known for its smartphone chips, MediaTek has suffered from a cloudy outlook for end-product demand as well as margin pressure due to competition and high development costs. The AI news has brought relief for the shares, which are still down 1% on the year. China business remains tough into 2026, yet “Google TPU upside should offset the smartphone headwind in the longer term,” according to Morgan Stanley analysts Charlie Chan and Daniel Yen. They upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight on Thursday. The early days of AI centered on training of large language models, which requires the massive computing power provided by graphic processing units such as those from Nvidia. The shift in focus to inference — or how LLMs respond to user queries — is putting a spotlight on application-specific integrated circuits such as TPUs. UBS Group AG analysts led by Sunny Lin raised their estimate for MediaTek’s sales contribution from TPUs in 2027 to $4 billion from $1.8 billion. The analysts see the chips accounting for 20% of the company’s operating profit by 2028, “depending on execution by MediaTek and Google,” they wrote in a note dated Thursday. Part of this week’s excitement was due to news that Meta Platforms Inc. is in discussions to use Google TPUs in data centers in 2027. UBS sees further potential upside for MediaTek from additional ASIC projects with Meta. The sell-side overall is bullish on MediaTek, with 23 buy recommendations, 10 holds and no sells. The consensus price target projects a further 9% rise in the stock over the next year. In terms of future AI stock investing, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts including Arthur Lai say they “lean more” toward MediaTek and other Google partners over the Nvidia supply chain. “We view the current AI surge as less a speculative bubble but rather a necessary, capital-intensive build-out of a new, foundational technology layer,” they wrote in a report this week.

Title: Mass. health insurance premium hikes worsen affordability crisis
URL: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/28/business/health-insurance-premium-massachusetts/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T10:55:28Z
Full Content:
Each time one of Tamara Modig’s children needs a telehealth appointment, she boots up a fragile 13-year-old laptop and prays it’ll hold a charge. Then Modig is forced to fret with another concern: the cost of health care. The Fitchburg Public Schools employee and her husband pay more than $9,300 annually in health insurance premiums for their family of five. It’s already a substantial chunk of their combined $160,000 income. Modig knows it’s almost certainly going to rise next year, though she won’t learn how much until spring. Already, her out-of-pocket maximum this past year increased by $1,000, to $4,000. The family doesn’t take vacations, drives only used cars, and lives on a strict budget — which is about to get even stricter. “You wonder if you can make that pair of shoes last longer,” Modig said. “Does last year’s coat still fit the kids?” FEATURED VIDEO The rising price of health insurance has become top of mind in many households across the state as families like the Modigs take stock during traditional open enrollment periods. Many employers’ premiums have risen by 10 percent or more, insurers and brokers say, straining families’ budgets at a time when overall health care costs are on the rise and expected to grow even more in the coming years. “This is the hardest health insurance market I’ve seen in two decades, with no end in sight,” said David Shore, executive vice president at Borislow Insurance, which helps companies across the East Coast, including in Massachusetts, navigate insurance and funding options. “It’s only going to get worse.” The costs aren’t just growing — they are exacerbating an affordability crisis for state residents and businesses, experts say. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a business-backed policy group, recently cited health care costs as a top concern, with Massachusetts having among the highest employer health care costs in the country. Advertisement Rising premiums, plus out-of-pocket health care costs, are all outpacing increases in household income, inflation, and other indicators of economic growth. As a result, Massachusetts is increasingly unaffordable to live in, said David Seltz, executive director of the state Health Policy Commission, during a recent hearing. Massachusetts had the highest insurance premiums in the US last year. And the years of consistent, rising premium costs in the state have long surpassed national trends. Families in Massachusetts spent, on average, $28,151 for employer-based health insurance last year, according to data presented by the Health Policy Commission, a state agency. Nationally, that figure was $24,540. And that’s just premiums. Consumers face other health care costs, including co-pays and deductibles. All told, the average annual cost of health care coverage for a family in Massachusetts was $32,469 in 2024. Since 2024, insurance costs have grown. Family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance grew 6 percent nationally from 2024 to 2025, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of employers. Because official data sources lag, it’s difficult to assess private insurance prices planned for 2026 in real time. But regardless of how a person gets commercial insurance — whether purchasing for themselves on the state’s insurance marketplace, going through a broker, getting it directly from an insurer, or receiving insurance through an employer — costs are seemingly on the rise for everyone next year. The state’s insurance exchange, where people and small businesses can buy their own insurance, has reported its premiums will increase by 11.5 percent, on average, in 2026. Those premium increases range from 7.2 percent by Fallon Health to 13.6 percent by Boston Medical Center Health Plan, which also goes by WellSense Health Plan. Advertisement These hikes and others mean small businesses are maxed out on health care costs, said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. “We’re at a breaking point,” Hurst said. Beyond pending retirements, profitability is flat and health care and energy costs have skyrocketed, meaning about half of small businesses in Massachusetts predicted they would have to sell or close within five years, a UMass Donahue Institute study showed in February. For businesses, premium increases can depend on a number of factors, including an employer’s size, health care usage trends, and how the employer purchases insurance. Less than half of Massachusetts employers are considered “fully insured,” meaning they buy insurance in which the insurer takes on the financial responsibility for paying out medical claims. Most of the employers in this group who have 50 to 100 employees are seeing whopping premium increases that range from 10 to 30 percent, said Mark Gaunya, principal at Borislow Insurance, which works with hundreds of companies of varying sizes. Larger employers in this bucket are more likely to see smaller price increases, he said, though things vary. Most employers in Massachusetts, however, are considered “self-insured” as they pay for the health care claims of their employees more directly. These types of workplaces are also seeing premium increases, from low single digit to low double digits. “I haven’t seen rate increases like this in a long, long time,” Gaunya said of the industry at large. “The market is really, really hard right now for a lot of people.” The state’s two largest insurers cited figures that were similar. At Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, “fully-insured” employers are seeing high single to low double-digit increases on average, though numbers vary widely depending on other factors, the insurer said. For its own employees, Blue Cross passed on an average 20 percent premium increase. Advertisement At Point32Health, premiums for employers with over 50 employees are increasing by about 15 to 20 percent on average in 2026, again with considerable variability. When confronted with ever-rising costs, employers have to get more creative with the way they offer insurance, or change what is covered. Beyond passing on the entirety of the increase to their employees as higher premiums, employers can redesign the plan, or shift more costs onto the employee. That can mean higher co-pays and deductibles, in addition to higher premiums. “We’re seeing more 20s- and 30-percent increases than we ever have before, in premiums. It’s quite insane,” said Gregory Puig, partner with Sentinel Group and the president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals. Shifting costs onto employees is not a new strategy. Nearly half of Massachusetts residents with commercial insurance had a high deductible health plan in 2023 — up from 19 percent in 2014, state data show. Average deductibles are also on the rise — from about $2,300 in 2014 to over $3,100 in 2023. Rob DiMase, a partner at Sentinel Group, an employee benefits administration and consulting firm, said these strategies have helped some employers he works with mitigate a 20 percent cost increase for next year, so the employees only see their premiums rise by 10 to 12 percent. Still, some employers are seeing huge increases. In the large group business, which includes employers with 50 to 500 employees, the best initial increase DiMase saw was 7 percent. The worst was around 57 percent. Escalating costs have patients worried about the future. Joe D’Eramo, 61, who has a broker, paid just over $615 monthly this year for coverage through WellSense. Beginning Jan. 1, that premium will increase by $90 per month and his deductible will rise by $500, to $3,500. Advertisement D’Eramo works as a freelance copy editor and public relations specialist, and drives for Uber on the side. But a $1,000 settlement with the ride share company will be wiped out by his health insurance increase. D’Eramo, who lives in Millis, was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He is counting down the years until he qualifies for Medicare, the government insurer that generally serves people 65 and older, so that he can save more money. “I just want to be able to make it to that [while still] healthy,” he said.

Title: Amazon placed him on a PIP. Here's how he bought himself time to find a new job.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Michael Permana learned that his time as a software engineer at Amazon might be running out, he made an interesting decision: he took paternity leave. In late February 2023, Permana was placed on a PIP. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in Fremont, California. He began applying for jobs right away, but knew it could take a while to land something new. He had a mortgage to pay, so he decided to buy himself roughly two months of breathing room by using the remainder of his paternity leave from when his daughter was born. By temporarily stepping away from work — and the scrutiny that came with being on a PIP — he figured he could prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role. "I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said. Permana is among the Americans who have taken steps to prepare for unemployment in a corporate landscape where, for some, job security feels less dependable than it once did. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of workers laid off by large corporations that are implementing strategic changes — including eliminating management layers, shifting investments toward AI, letting go of underperforming employees, and cutting costs across the board. While some workers had a sense their roles might be eliminated, others said they were caught off guard — pointing to their tenure, clean performance records, and the financial strength of their employers. Permana shared how he landed a new role after a challenging search — and offered advice for others facing performance pressure. When reached for comment, Amazon said that it regularly reviews its performance evaluation process to ensure it best supports the growth and development of its employees. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies such as applying for jobs before trouble strikes, launching side businesses, or secretly juggling multiple jobs. In Permana's case, at least he had some warning, and paternity leave bought him some time to look for his next gig. That doesn't mean his job search was easy. His two main search strategies were applying to software engineering roles on LinkedIn and exploring opportunities through recruiters he connected with on the platform. Permana landed a few interviews at Meta, Instawork, and HubSpot, but was ultimately rejected from all of them. He said he tried applying to the software company SnapLogic, where he'd worked more than a decade previously, but was denied there as well. "It was very hard," he said, adding that he still has a "collection" of rejection emails he's compiled for tracking purposes. By the time Permana returned from paternity leave in May, he still hadn't landed a new job, and he continued to feel that his performance was under scrutiny. However, he soon advanced in the interview process for a software engineering role at the mobile game developer MobilityWare. A friend who worked there referred him for the position, which he believes helped him get an interview. In late May, Permana received an offer. In June, his tenure at Amazon came to an end, and he began the new role — a remote position that offered the flexibility he was looking for. Permana said he enjoyed the job but recently left for a software engineering role at the mobile messaging platform Attentive, citing higher pay as a key reason for the switch. When it comes to navigating a performance improvement plan, Permana said his best advice is to communicate openly with your manager and focus on doing exactly what they're asking of you. However, he also believes it's wise to assume things might not work out — and to start applying for jobs elsewhere. As for advice on landing a software engineering role, Permana said his two biggest tips are to seek out referrals whenever possible and to dedicate significant time to interview preparation. He recalled that Meta's interview process, for example, included coding questions that required extensive prep. One question, he said, touched on a concept he hadn't thought about in the last two decades of his career. Permana believes the questions were so demanding that it would be difficult for any working professional to find enough time to prepare properly. "You'd have to study for a few months to be able to do those questions," he said. Reviewing questions on LeetCode, a coding interview prep website, helped him prepare for interviews at Meta and elsewhere — but he said it still required a significant time investment. Permana's advice: Find ways to carve out enough time for your job search — even if it doesn't involve taking paternity leave. Jump to

Vivek Yadav, an engineering manager from Stripe, shares his experience in building a testing system based on multi-year worth of data. He shares insights into why Apache Spark was the choice for creating such a system and how it fits in the "traditional" engineering practices. Micro-frontends differ from components by emphasising autonomy and flow over standardisation and reuse—a sociotechnical shift aligned with Conway's law. Migration should be gradual, starting where autonomy is most beneficial and ensuring that the architecture aligns with the team structure. Duplication can benefit the flow and enable iterative delivery, rather than requiring extensive rewrites.

Matthias Niehoff: I'm Matthias. I work for codecentric, a small consultancy in Germany. Before I joined codecentric, I made my professional education in an insurance company. When I finished this education, I came back to the company and they said, congratulations, and yes, we want you to stay with us. We have a new job for you. Back then I was in the architecture team, whatever that meant. The job is going to be in the data warehouse team. I was like, what? Because for me, data is that which the others are doing. From a software engineering perspective, I didn't care about data warehouses. This is where the data goes and they get it some magical way. Turns out it was a joke. I stayed in the architecture team. After joining codecentric, I moved into the data space. I started with Apache Spark 10 years ago, and then evolved into getting all the data stuff, but I have a software engineering background turning data. These challenges remain. From a software engineering perspective, it's often still like data, data, data for analytics, it's not that that we care about. I'll give you an example. Thinking about, we have some data that is stored, order data and order id and quantity, on the right side, we have the analytics side. We just get the order id and the quantity. Then the application thing, we want to track if the order was unfulfilled. The analytics side still doesn't select order id and quantity, and wonders, we have more orders than we had in stock because they didn't know there was an unfulfilled field that they had to track and that has to be selected as well. They're eventually coming up to select this as well, but they want to measure now the unfulfilled items and then they change the data type from a Boolean to an integer. What happens? Either the consuming side converts it implicitly to a Boolean and it basically fails silently, or they just fail implicit because the data type has changed. This is a quite common scenario we have when providing data. What is the reason? The problem is that most of the time only the technical schema is exposed towards the consumers of the data. The consumers just get that schema and try to reverse engineer what is actually happening here. What is the business process that creates that data? What are the constraints here? What is the data model underneath? Also, is this source really trustable? Can I trust it? How do I access it? Is it stable? Is it durable? All these questions remain. It might just be a dump on a file system somewhere more often than not. On the other side, the producers, if they even care who uses the data, they don't often know who uses the data. For what reason? For what purpose? They're most of the time blind on this side. To summarize, most of the time, data is still a second-class citizen, if we're talking about software architectures. It's just a database where we store the data in. This leads to quick one-off solution if data is to provide it, we do dumps. We just say, here, you have a user for our database. You can access it. Nobody would do that normally, but, yes, that's done. The data team is left on its own. I'm going to show you some examples of what we did with clients to manage this. The first example is a small FinTech, which is in the realms of a larger bank in Germany. They were doing B2C stuff, and they wanted to do analysis on marketing campaigns on how the customers behave, what kind of customers they have. They want to check their online sales process. Nothing fancy, just gathering some data from different systems. There was a small team of data analysts who were really curious about getting results out of data, not the really technical guys, all your Python, all your SQL and know how to start a Jupyter Notebook, but they were more interested in, what is the data to say. They had minimal support from the org. The org was really focusing on the application. It was DevOps and software engineers and all this stuff, but they want to just build online applications. They didn't really see the case for data. As a data team, what did we do? We got files, in this case, dumped over at an SFTP server. The first thing we do, we did tests on the source data. In this case we used dbt. We wrote tests to test what is in the data. Does the data change? Is it what we expected, to get notified early if there would be changes in the data? For instance, there would be all null columns, because suddenly would likely mean there was some problem in the export of the data from the source system. We made it visible. We built dashboards. This is elementary build on dbt. It most of the time didn't look like this. This is in the best case. We want to make it really visible. Having this really as a chart where we looked on each day and also using it to communicate with our stakeholders, we don't have the data we needed. Data is broken and so on. We started documenting what we learned about the data. How is data created? What is the business process behind the data? What are the constraints? We learned on the fly, basically, while working with the data. We adjusted the test to actually have the knowledge we had in the test. We extended this. This also was part of dbt in the end. This was all just basically mitigation of the problems. We had mitigation of the problems that the producer actually wanted on board. We wanted to get to the source. We wanted to involve the producers to actually help us getting better data. Maybe it's getting a step back. If you have an application data model where you store your data of the application, you have defined it everywhere. Might be in normal form. Might be normalized or whatever. You have another application wanting to access this. No software engineer on earth would say, here's the application model, just do the access on it. You would always build some API on it. Might be a REST API, might be a stream. You might be putting on messages on AMQP, whatever. You would always use an abstraction. From analytics, it's more often than not like this. You just dump out the internal application model. What we're thinking about is we want to use an API as well. Maybe not the REST API that is optimized for single record access, but maybe some more efficient. Or it might even be a separate data model that has been created for sharing the data towards the outside. All of this should actually be the responsibility of the team. We should care about how those interfaces look like. How should those interfaces look like where we share those data from the team towards the analytics part. The one thing is, how is this sharing data model created? It needs some pipeline. It has to be some process, something where this sharing data model is created. The sharing data model itself, from a technology perspective, could be a view in the same database that they are using for the application. It might be a topic in some broker. It might be files in Blob storage. It might be Iceberg tables, data tables, CSV, whatever. It might be something in a data warehouse or data lake. With the MCP servers now giving LLMs access to data, the first idea is popping up to actually use MCP servers to access those data. I'm not sure if it's a good idea still, but at least something one can have in mind. We need those pipelines so that software developers can easily share this data. These pipelines should be part of the whole application, so owned by the development team. The development team is responsible for creating this data model for sharing the data. First of all, it means more responsibilities, but also it gives you chances. I think a lot of you who work in data know that CI/CD tests and so on are not as widespread as in software engineering. It might be a chance for software development teams to actually build and use their software stack, to use their best practices or good practices that they have, writing tests, doing CI/CD from this. Taking ownership of it means not only responsibility, but also having the freedom to do it in the way they want to implement it. In the same tech stack, possibly. It's just another API that they are building next to maybe an existing REST API. Still, those pipelines need to be supported. We want to support those people with blueprints, with libraries creating this. It might be that the application tech might be Java something or Kotlin or so on. On the data side and on the consumer side where you want to provide the data might be something like a Delta Lake managed by Databricks. I happen to have an example afterwards. You need to do more support for this. You need to do support for execution and retry, something that is not that usual in a normal web application. You have to build frameworks and things for this. You have to enable monitoring with them. Yes, they can use the monitoring that they use for applications, but it might be something different. Schema evolution, write to data-specific infrastructure? Also, things in business, like data changes have to be supported. Those are some of the things they are not used to when writing a normal application. Next example. We have a Java application writing to a Databricks-powered data lake. Most of the developers that would implement this application don't know what Databricks is or know how to use it or how to implement it, and how to do stuff in it. They might be able to do this, writing data to a Blob storage, maybe in Parquet file and not in JSON, or something a little bit more efficient. There are two options, basically. You can register this as an external table in Unity Catalog, or you can load it to Databricks. I won't discuss which one is better, but as a software developer, I just don't care. I don't want to know how to do this. The pipeline should support, actually, this library. We built libraries that made it possible to just say, I have a large amount of data here in some file or in a database, and I want to publish it. The library takes care, with the pipeline behind it, to put the data into a Blob storage, load it to Databricks, make it available there. The SDK or the library had some input fields, so you can do a description in it, you can put information to the data in it, so that it gets published to the Unity Catalog as well. This was just the beginning of the interface we were describing. We started collecting also not only the data, but also information and metadata about it. We took another step forward after this. One thing we used were data contracts. I think most of you have heard of data mesh, a few years old by now. Huge impact, huge hype back then, a lot of different concepts. I think the most tangible concept that was there was the data products, and out of this came the data contracts. Contracts basically describe the data that you're sharing between a data provider that has some data product, in this case it would be the application team, and the data consumer, what data they share, and how it looks like, and what guarantees that gives you. The data contract is then described often as a YAML file, and you can use it for enforcement. I'll come to it later. The most important part is you make it explicit. You explicitly describe, we share or provide this data, and we use it, and they talk to each other, which most of the time didn't happen before. What would a data contract look like? I have here the high-level overview of a data contract on the right side. You have servers. Where's the data stored? Might be in a database, might be in S3 bucket, might be anything, might be a topic. You have the schema of this. You can put price tags on it. If you say consumption costs like this, so you can enforce it, informational only. You give information about who's the team. You give roles. You give SLA properties. We give you the guarantee that this data is up to date, or is updated every day, at maximum lags behind one day after the event has occurred. We give you guarantees that we will do failure resolution of data within whatever days. This is really something that you argue about, and more often than not, coming to points where you're saying, you expect this, now we only can deliver this, because we have this and this constraint on this. Then you find a solution together. We created those contracts data first, so we had the data, and then we started creating a contract, all of the data. You can just say, here's data, just build a contract out of it. We versioned those things with semantic versioning. We put it into a central Git repository. What we used was the Open Data Contract Standard. There are multiple standards, currently it seems like this is the one that evolves from all of those standards, and it's going to be the main standard, until there's another one. We were lucky and did the right choice at this point. I see that we can also enforce those contracts. There's a CLI, datacontract-cli as it's called, where you can test those contracts. You have defined this contract in a YAML file, all the information inside, where's the data stored, what kind of schema do we expect, and we're doing tests on it. We can also do like, do we have breaking changes? If we do another version of the data contract, we can just give the YAML file of the old contract, of the new contract, and say, is this breaking or is it forward compatible? Can we use it again? What we did is, we created source tests. You remember right at the beginning, we manually created source tests, we can create dbt source tests, based on the information we have in our contract, and use those to enforce the data, and test the data as a consumer. Where were we enforcing the contracts in the end? Once on the publisher side, in CI/CD. We changed an API. We created a pull request. Within the pull request, we checked the changes against the contract. We checked for the format, for the schema, for the data quality, is it still what we expected? If all these checks passed, then that was one of the necessary requirements to get those pull requests merged. On the consumer side, on the other side, we also retrieved the data, and the first thing we do, we're checking the data. Checking for schema. Checking for quality. Checking if those SLAs we had agreed on were true. This is what we did there. Where and how did we check for reliability? Because one of the topics is reliability. We did unit tests and tested contracts in the app development. The pipeline execution, we tested against data, and we integrated it into application monitoring, having one view, and not the application monitoring with Grafana and whatever, and some other view somewhere else. We did source tests and tests in further stages along the processing as well. Didn't go into details here. Reliable and trusted data is important to scale the data usage. When I'm talking about scale, I'm not talking about having billions and billions and more data, but with scale, I mean getting more out of the data we have, empowering more use cases, getting more use cases done, creating more value for the business. This is, for me, scale. I don't need the tech scale. It's interesting, but it's not necessarily the most important part. Next to this trusted data, what is the role of tech and platform in this case? We talked about the pipeline getting data, but what is the role of tech and platform? A few people know this. What does it mean when you see this? For me, it's sometimes really a cognitive overload. This is all the tooling and things one should know, or at least have an idea about what they do when it comes to data, and it's getting bigger and bigger. Also, GenAI is included, which is a big part of it, but it's really a lot. For me, sometimes it's really causing constant stress. I just go through LinkedIn or whatever, or Hacker News, and see there's a new tool, and there's something cool, and there's something I want to have to dig in, and it's really like constant stress. What do you do then if you're coming in this thing? There's multiple strategies of what people do. You try to start, I'm looking everywhere. I'm trying to get there. I get an idea there, and so you know nothing about everything, basically. Or another strategy is, that's too much. I just focus on this one and go really deep. I know everything about Apache Spark. I don't care what's left and right, but in Apache Spark, I'm the absolute expert. Or you just say, no, back then, we were just using Apache NiFi example. We can do everything with it. You're just clinging to the past, also a strategy that people are doing. Or you get dogmatic, or you just give up and say, what else? I just don't care. It's definitely this complexity and all these things that might be there, and people are telling you, and market telling you, you need this to get actually data platform, and this is needed, and this is needed. It's unhealthy for people, and it's unhealthy for organizations. A reason why I might come back to something that is essential complexity versus accidental complexity. Essential complexity is the things that you need to fulfill your functional requirements, your non-functional requirement, and there might be some boundary conditions. A lot of you might be in banking, so there are boundary conditions from regulations or whatever that you have to comply to. These are essential complexity. You cannot do this without those complexity. It's inherent to the problem and the essence of the problem that you are solving. All the rest is the accidental complexity. Is using Kubernetes over kubectl really essential to the problem you're solving? Might be, might not be. I tend to say in data, more often than not, it's not the problem. For me, there's a lot of accidental complexity we introduce by using those tooling. Therefore, it's really important to embrace simple and effective solutions to really build things that solve the problems at hand, to scale things. A good strategy to do this is choose boring technologies. Technologies that are well understood, both in what they can do, what they can't do, and what failures might occur. You might find all failures in Stack Overflow, or ChatGPT has learned about them. It's pretty good to understand. You have a community. You have people to talk about. It might be sometimes that a new problem comes up where existing and boring technology doesn't work. One of the most boring technologies, which is pretty good at data, is actually Postgres. It's not as sexy as Snowflake. It's not as fast as DuckDB. Postgres is actually a really good solution for a lot of data cases we have. Also, there's the concept of innovation tokens. A really good idea. There's the idea of, as a team, you have two or three or one innovation token per year that you can spend on new technologies. You try to manage and not to lose yourself into new stuff as well. Next to boring technologies and also Postgres, is you build on well-understood technical foundation and open standards. Open standards give you the flexibility to argue with vendors, to switch things. It's good understanding. There's a foundation to use this. One of the open standards next to Postgres is all the things that come towards data storage right now. Think data storage in the cloud is a lot of getting commodities. If you're using Delta or Iceberg or Parquet, it's open standards. Also, query engines get open standards, and you can build on top of this. Another thing to keep things simple is leveraging the key concept of the cloud. Doing automation. Doing scaling to zero, and reduce the vertical integration. I said, I'm not a big fan of Kubernetes in data because I think there's a lot of good PaaS and SaaS platforms that actually go higher level and enable you to do more with less in the end. This might be something that is very familiar to a lot of software engineers, but you see in the data place, there's a gap between what software engineering knows and what software engineers knows is a good thing, and what data engineering does. Another case, a pretty conservative bank, slow, not that large, regional bank, a cooperative, they want to do more data-driven decisions. Which management doesn't want to do more data-driven decisions? The existing solutions didn't scale, not in terms of data, but scale in terms of what decisions we can make, what kind of insights do we get? They built a cloud data platform. They use a central team for the platform, no data mesh, but they have different data user teams that actually use those platforms. What we built is we used open standards. A platform in the cloud, in this case, it's Azure, but it could be any cloud, using Delta Lake as an open standard for software, using PySpark, which is an open-source product to run their data. Nobody wants to run PySpark on its cluster on its own. You never want to do this. We used Databricks. We used the Unity Catalog, which is proprietary stuff, yes, but it gives us things that we didn't get about any standards, gives us things about permissions, management. It's not the business data catalog, it's a technical data catalog. We're using Databricks Serverless SQL to access that data. Those are proprietary things, but the foundations are open source and open standards. We used also the Unity Catalog features to provide the data towards, I said, we had a core team and multiple single teams as well. We had the core team having catalogs, and those can be shared within other teams. We're using the Unity Catalog features of Databricks with it. If you're building things like these, on Kubernetes, you have to find a solution where you can do the cataloging. The Unity Catalog is open source. I've not seen a lot of companies actually running it. You want to get it managed because you won't get paid for running in catalog most of the time. We use the catalogs for data sharing between those departments. This was proprietary stuff, yes, but built on open foundation. Those open foundations enabled us, for instance, to use different query engines. Databricks is a great platform. I really like it. Other platforms might be good as well. I'm not that experienced with it. If you are coming to data that is not huge, but it's big, like 30 gigs, 40 gigs, or whatever, Spark is actually really slow. It's a lot of overhead to actually process the data. Thanks to the open standard, we could use DuckDB to connect that data. We can get a token from Unity Catalog and read the data from the Delta Lake. It's an open catalog. It's an open standard, nothing proprietary. Because one thing, data is smaller than you might think. This is an analysis of Amazon Redshift. The team behind Amazon Redshift did it. It's a few months old already. This is the title, Why TPC Is Not Enough. TPC is a benchmark used in analytics to measure the speed of warehouses and SQL engines. The paper was about, is TPC still the right benchmark? They analyzed all the data they have in their system and they found out, actually most of the data, so we have the rowcount buckets up to 10 million rows over here. Ten million rows isn't that much on data, but most of the data actually is about 10 million rows. It's not that big. Sometimes it's even enough to run on a single machine. You don't need distributed systems at all, making it simpler, easier, more cost-effective, and more reliable to build data platforms. Another example, we built a more small stack, FinTech. We want to do everything on-prem. There were some reasons to do this. We just built things on Postgres with dbt and Airflow to orchestrate. One can argue if Airflow is a bit of overkill, yes. We use Python to ingest the data. We use the contracts before to actually synchronize on the data and have a clear interface between this. It was really simple tech, nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. One thing I want to give you, apply software engineering best practices. I'm on a more or less software engineering conference for you as clients, writing tests for code and data, monitoring and observability, infrastructure as code. It's all a given, but it isn't too much in the data world, actually. It's a hard way to say, tests are a benefit. You also have to understand, yes, some things are definitely different. Data gives you another dimension. The data itself is another dimension you have to test as well, using separate environments. Also thinking that software engineers say, of course I use separate environments. In data, it more often than not comes to this. Separate environments is often like, yes, we have prod. Bringing it together, reducing the complexity of the platform also reduces the error surface. Reducing complexity reduces costs. All in all, this improves reliability of your data platform, data pipelines. Then using standards, improving practices, simplifies the operation, also less complexity, less overhead, and sometimes a single node system can bring you a long way. We talked about having the pipelines and contracts basically in the platform and say it's simplifying. Maybe take one step further here. Another idea I just want to present and give out. Another case, an industrial IoT startup. They collected sensor data in their electronic grid and they visualized that data. Eventually, they also want to control the grid based on the data. What they did is they had a document database, put all the data into the document database. The team was consisting mostly of full stack developers and mostly heavily leaning to the TypeScript and the ecosystem around this. Then, a document database is fine, because if you're building a frontend with TypeScript, all the data is in JSON, perfect. At some point, they started wanting to do data analysis. What we had were like this. We had an ingest. The data was put into a document database. There was a UI and APIs connected to the document database, and there was a relational database for some master data. What stations did we have? What centers did we have out in the field? Pretty common. Document database was also using the time series mode of those databases. Then they wanted to add aggregations on this, because they wanted to do hourly and daily values, so they did a Python script that runs on Document DB, then they wanted to have alerts running on the Document DB, getting the data out of it. The relational database was extended somehow because they wanted to do analytics. The center of the data was actually Document DB. To summarize this, this was actually a web application that is a data platform with a UI. It's not a web application, but the center of this application is data. We built a UI on it, but it's not a UI and data is somewhere. We redesigned it. We have the ingest, and the first place where the data lands is the data platform. We don't have any application doing anything, but we have the data platform, the one that is responsible for storing, analyzing the data. We do all the aggregation and the alerting on this data platform. Then we have the Document DB that is fed from the data platform with the data that is needed to visualize the data. It might be aggregated. It might be filtered. It might be optimized to actually fit the needs of visualization. We had data analytics directly on the data platform. What we did basically is a shift left. Shift left is like everywhere. Shift left in security is more about having it earlier in the process, in designing as well. We have to shift left in the data flows, not too much in the process of creating the software. There might be ideas as well, but in the shift left in data flow. We had from data source to application to doing some ETL and ELT stuff to doing it somewhere where we do analytics. We moved it to, we're having a data platform. Some optional ETL, ELT might be, might not be. Depends on what data platform you have. You don't have to load the data. You might access the data platform directly. Then connected some analytics stuff, some web application where a user can do something. I'm not saying this should be done for all, definitely not. I think especially for applications where the data is in the center, and I see it a lot in IoT and industrial applications where you get a lot of sensor data or also in marketing where you get tracking data. This might actually make sense to move data at the center and not treating this like an application. We moved the data lake. When we think about this, we can even take it one step further. Why do we actually build different platforms for data and applications? There was a talk about platform engineer basically and developer experience. It was a lot about building applications for software engineers with all the CI/CD and the golden path and improving the developer experience, making it easy to deploy stuff. It's all good and all fine. What we end up with, we have an application platform where we run all the applications on it. We have a data platform, which is storing the data and powering ML and AI use cases, BI use cases. Taking observability, for instance. Observability is a huge thing in application platforms. Monitoring, logs, all the stuff is built into it. We would definitely need more of this in data platforms. There is a lot of things that can be used. Most of the time, the data platform solves it itself. I take an example, Databricks. Getting data out of Databricks for monitoring and observability reasons is possible, but definitely not easy to do. It's completely two separate subsystems with different approaches, with different technologies. I don't think it has to be like this. This is actually also widening the gap between those systems, because we're building on different platforms and different paradigms, and try to avoid this. We use the data platform, getting the data from the data management. Why don't we build application and data platforms? Platforms that actually have in mind from the beginning, we want to support application development, running applications, and using the data within this application for analytical purposes. We have things like storage and runtime. The storage might be different for data than for applications. The runtime might be different, but it comes from one vision, might not be one team, but from one platform building this. Everything that is CI/CD means there are proven patterns on how to do CI/CD in every software company, most likely. I think 80% of the time those can be reused for data. Why not provide it to data within a data platform as well? All the stuff like secret management. Secret management, there's a lot of tooling around it, but it's reinvented in data as well. Test data management, and the contracts themselves. The contracts are in between application and data. This is what is common to both, and of course should be managed within this platform itself. You might be asking, what is the tech? There isn't the one technology that powers all of this. You might say, yes, we built everything on Kubernetes because we built our developer platform and our data platform on Kubernetes. One might say Databricks or Snowflake or whatever might be your thing. I would say, coming back to what I said was platforms, we did think about what is the essential complexity? What is the accidental complexity? What complexity is actually needed to solve this? It might be that Kubernetes is one thing. It might be that Kubernetes powers all of your cases and all the things that you have also with data. It might be that you have two different technologies and just creating good bridges in between and good integrations in between. It might be that there's even another solution based on this. There isn't the one answer. I promised I'm coming back to DuckDB as well. It's an idea of DuckDB not seeing this, but I think it's a good thing to think about is going beyond two-tier data architectures. The two-tier data architecture is basically this. We have data in the application. We have data in the analytics part. This is an idea of DuckDB. DuckDB, pretty fast embedded analytical query engine and database, which can basically run everywhere on a server or in a browser with Wasm, or in a Lambda function, and can read basically everywhere. Having the central data lake, in this case it's more like a swamp maybe, or between a lake and a swamp, as a central datastore, both powering applications and analytics on the same way. It's an idea. We haven't seen this in a project. I think it's an idea worth thinking about, maybe having in mind when designing this. Because, in my opinion, it would be a good thing when data and applications became one. We would have less friction between operational and analytics: common ground, common platform, common ideas maybe to build stuff. We could actually define and encapsulate responsibilities more clearly. Remember the example from the IoT startup? There was a long discussion. Who should do the aggregation? Who is responsible for doing the other thing? Is it the application or is it the data team? Where is the knowledge about when to do the other thing? If you're thinking this is one, then it's a common ground you find and you can decide together where it is. You might have optimized data representations for different cases. A document database isn't that good actually for analytics. There might be better settings, but it's really good for UIs, for example. The same is a Blob storage isn't that good for actually real-time requests from a web UI, but a document database would be. It's really important to use the tooling on both sides. Not saying, we have Kubernetes and Postgres and everything, so just get started with this and do this, but to know the stringencies, the differences that there are. Also, use the engineering best practices and good practices, and apply them to data. What do we take away from this? The first thing, validate and monitor your data early on. Having contracts both from the provider side, and do it on the consumer side as well. Start at the source. Really take the devs into this. Don't say, we just get the data and we have to be on our own. Try to get the devs on board by building solutions and abstractions that actually have them, that make it easy for them. Don't say to them, here's Databricks, publish it there. You can build workflows there. You just need to write Python and write it to Parquet. No, that's not going to work. Really get to the devs and get them where they are, and address those pains. Of course, the organization has to prioritize data as well, otherwise every product owner of every team would just say data, data, I don't care. Simplify the architecture. Don't make it more complex. Really make it handleable, also for smaller teams, for teams that are not that experienced. It doesn't have to be the latest, newest technology everywhere. Apply the good practices you know from software engineering. It might be a thing to think data and application platform together, not separate those worlds from the beginning, from the foundation. It's getting split up in the application anyway and in the usage, but maybe having a common ground to actually build on them. We talk a lot about tech now. Actually, data modeling is really a thing. Only write tables and having everything joined and having one large table might not be sufficient all the time. Things like star schema, dimensional modeling, all this stuff isn't the sexy part, but it's actually really helpful. Besides all the tech, there's also some things to learn from data and good classic data warehouse. Although, sometimes it's really dry, but it's helpful. Nardon: Your take on using the data for application and for the operational system using the same platform. Usually, in companies, especially when you have several departments, you have teams that need data from other departments. Usually, that's why there's a data platform where you can advertise your data and share data with other teams. If you're using the same platform for data and applications, this gets a little more complex, because you have the teams developing the data and having to share. How are you doing a data mesh architecture and sharing data between departments if you're using the same architecture? Matthias Niehoff: Even when you build the same platform for application and data, I would still have those typical data platform capabilities like having a catalog and having access management to different data, and a point where data is shared towards others. It would be still a capability that should be built into this application and data platform, definitely. It's not like we don't have the traditional data platform anymore with all the functions. We still have those functions, just moved to one platform that is developed under one common vision with one common ground and one common goal. I'm pretty sure in a large organization, it won't be one team building this platform as well. What's more interesting is, often it's like the data department, especially in classical environments, somewhere in finance and the CFO might be the boss and the application platform is in CDO, CTO, CIO department, and it's completely different areas of the organization with different cultures as well. This is more like a tricky thing I see that would hinder adoption of this. Yes, definitely. Participant 1: How do you know when you should start buying a tool instead of building on your own? Because a lot of the other talks so far have said that you should buy before you build, but you say to choose boring tech. At what point do you know that you should switch to buying existing software? Matthias Niehoff: Boring tech doesn't mean you shouldn't buy. Postgres, ok, you don't buy Postgres, but you could buy Databricks with PySpark, and PySpark is boring tech. It depends. When you're doing stuff that you have the feeling of, it may mean you could take Wardley Maps or something to get out what is commodity, what is actually new, in genesis. If you're building stuff that is undifferentiated heavy lifting, things you do that don't provide really value to you, running a Kubernetes cluster as a data team, I would take as an example. Then you think about, might there be something that would reduce the vertical integration that gives us more intermediate ways to do things with data, work with data. I don't have one person that actually only is there to run the Kubernetes cluster. I think this would be a thing. It's not like there's this one idea to do this. This is more like, depends on your situation. Participant 2: I think my question is around the complexities of having a platform that has already been adopted or consumed by multiple data teams. How easy is it actually to change technology? I think I'm asking this because we're moving in a world where technologies are released every day. We see that there's a Microsoft Fabric that's been introduced now to say that it's also removing the complexities around infrastructure. How do you actually manage that? Because we are also in a distributed type of mesh, and data teams are actually responsible for their own tech. How do you ensure that all those principles can actually be a central component? Matthias Niehoff: When you were changing tech, what would be the motivation, would be the question? Why would you choose changing the tech? Just to standardize, and all of them having the same technology? That wouldn't be enough as an argument to just change tech. If you say, we have to standardize because we have increasing license costs because everybody has bought their own tooling and so on, yes, then it's more or less a classical migration and modernization project with a clear path on how to move each of those teams to a central technology or a central platform. You still want to have distributed responsibilities, I understand, so teams are responsible for the data, but they should use common infrastructure. It's more like a normal modernization project. Participant 3: You commented that running the same data platform for applications as well as, let's say, analytics is not something you've seen much of. I'm aware of a few that run, Uber, us, and usually the complexity is around non-functionals. There are two patterns I know, which is running multiple concurrent versions of the same platform optimized for different non-functionals, and the one we're attempting, which is to use the same platform overlaying the tooling on the same source. You keep talking about DuckDB and these tools. Given those two paradigms, do you have a thought as which one you think would be more efficient, profitable, functional? Matthias Niehoff: You mean by having one platform or having separate platforms? Participant 3: One platform with three different copies of the data optimized for the different non-functional use cases or one version of the data platform that then has to support optimizing for different use cases. Matthias Niehoff: Yes, either optimizing the data or optimizing the processing, is basically the question. Participant 3: For me, the question is usually around the idea of overlaying tooling, so different interfaces, query products. Matthias Niehoff: It depends a bit. For instance, if you're taking a database as your storage, then you have the query engine baked in. Then you can't change too much. If you say my data is stored in a Blob storage underneath and I just use a different engine, then you would be flexible, of course. I think then flexibility actually pays off and it would go that way. It depends a lot on how you store it, but you made one good point. This distinction between having storage and query engine directly coupled goes more and more away. We have the storage that is often pretty cheap as a Blob storage, and we have query engines that optimize for different use cases, definitely.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Black Friday has passed, but the deals continue all weekend into Cyber Monday, and there are lots to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated November 30: We have reviewed the best prices and found some of more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout the day and throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $274, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: AVAX Reclaims Top 20 Spot as Securitize Chooses Avalanche for EU Securities Platform

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Avalanche (AVAX) is back in the spotlight after reclaiming its position among the top 20 cryptos to surpass Hedera (HBAR), just as Securitize secures EU approval to launch the region’s first fully regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network. This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. As institutional momentum builds and Europe’s first regulated blockchain securities market goes live on Avalanche, AVAX’s comeback narrative is gaining traction—and a trend reversal may be closer than the charts imply.

The asset manager’s hybrid rollout enables investors to choose between the traditional fund and a new blockchain-based version recorded on Ethereum. Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has introduced its first tokenized share class for a euro money market fund. The fund is now offered in a hybrid structure, allowing investors to choose between the traditional version and the new blockchain-based one. The first transaction was recorded on the Ethereum network on Nov. 4. The rollout was developed in collaboration with CACEIS, a European asset-servicing group that provided the tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and the digital order system used to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, tokenizing the fund streamlines order processing, widens access to new investor channels, and enables 24/7 trading. Amundi said the fund holds short-term, high-quality euro-denominated debt, primarily comprising money-market instruments and overnight repurchase agreements with European sovereigns. According to the company’s website, it manages about 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in assets and serves more than 100 million retail clients. Amundi is based in Paris, France. Related: Societe Generale-Forge taps Bullish to debut MiCA-licensed USDCV stablecoin Tokenized money market funds investing in US Treasurys have expanded rapidly in 2025. RWA.xyz data shows BlackRock’s onchain money market product currently holds $2.3 billion in tokenized assets, while Franklin Templeton’s money market fund has more than $826 million in assets. Both funds have been expanding across multiple blockchains. On Nov. 12, Franklin Templeton announced that its tokenization platform joined the Canton Network, enabling its money market fund to operate within a permissioned ecosystem built for financial institutions. BlackRock has also expanded its tokenized fund beyond Ethereum, adding support for Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon. A Bank for International Settlements bulletin released on Wednesday noted that tokenized money market funds had climbed to $9 billion in value by the end of October, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. However, the report warned that the growing adoption of tokenized Treasury portfolios as collateral could expose the financial system to new operational and liquidity vulnerabilities.

Title: Recovery In Sight? Charles Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin Reaching $250,000 By 2026

Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has offered a ray of hope to Bitcoin (BTC) holders, tipping the cryptocurrency to recover its yearly losses and set a new all-time high. Hoskinson noted that an imminent Bitcoin rally will send prices all the way to $250,000 before the end of next year. According to a recent interview, Hoskinson revealed that Bitcoin is primed for a recovery run that will see the asset recoup its recent losses in the coming months. The Cardano co-founder disclosed that the largest cryptocurrency is only facing short-term downsides due to macroeconomic pressures. Hoskinson argued that the Bitcoin price has been adversely impacted by Trump tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties, noting that “crypto is not immune to the macro.” Since October, Bitcoin price has tumbled from its peak of over $126,000 to trade below the $90,000 mark, erasing all its yearly gains. Despite the jarring price drops, Hoskinson is eyeing a meteoric rally for Bitcoin “over the next two quarters.” Furthermore, the outspoken Cardano founder tipped Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the end of the year, defying claims of an extended rally. Hoskinson clarified that institutions will lead the incoming bull run, unlike previous retail-led bull markets. He pointed to Wall Street’s growing participation in the ecosystem, with BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and the US government scrambling to accumulate Bitcoin. Apart from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and frenetic adoption by treasury companies, Hoskinson hinged his bullish estimates on the steady rise of stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Hoskinson revealed that retail will still play a key role in the anticipated bull run, with the number of cryptocurrency holders predicted to climb to 1 billion. “The fundamentals are just sound. There is no way for this market to stay depressed forever,” said Hoskinson. They are just reflecting their current macro environment.” Previously, Charles Hoskinson tipped Bitcoin to climb to $1 million but did not disclose a timeline for the milestone. Meanwhile, several experts have made bold calls for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, with the average at $150,000. However, recent price performance has put a dent in end-of-year predictions, with BTC threatening to fall below $85K. While Bitcoin continues its decline, other cryptocurrencies are also facing a torrid patch with Ethereum and XRP wallowing below $3,000 and $2, respectively. BNB, SOL, and DOGE have recorded losses of over 5% over the last day, while Cardano’s ADA tumbled by nearly 8% in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 2.44% to settle at $3.12 trillion.

Title: Goldman Sachs flags 'growing signs of weakness' in the US jobs market as layoffs mount

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Goldman Sachs researchers are warning that the US labor market may be starting to soften as private-sector data show a growing wave of layoffs across several industries, the Wall Street bank said in a new report. The firm said state filings related to planned mass layoffs have surged to their highest level since 2016, excluding the pandemic spike — the sharpest increase Goldman has tracked in nearly a decade. Layoff announcements compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks corporate job cuts, had by October climbed to a level previously unseen outside of a recession, the report noted, citing cuts in sectors like tech, industrial goods, and food and beverage as factors that drove the increase. Goldman's economists said the combination of rising layoff signals is concerning — representing "growing signs of weakness" — because workers are increasingly struggling to secure new employment, making rebounding after losing a paycheck especially difficult. Even some of corporate America's biggest names haven't evaded the job market's cooling. Amazon, for example, announced plans this fall to eliminate about 14,000 corporate jobs as it seeks to streamline and embrace AI. "A sustained increase in layoffs would be particularly concerning because the hiring rate for workers is low and it is harder than usual for the unemployed to find jobs," economists Manuel Abecasis and Pierfrancesco Mei wrote. The state filings Goldman cited — known as Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices — are required by companies with more than 100 employees in advance of instituting layoffs. They're a helpful indicator of employer behavior, signaling when cuts may be around the corner. On top of the rise in WARN notices, the bank found that the leadership of more publicly traded companies had begun openly discussing potential layoffs on recent earnings calls with shareholders. Taken together with the Challenger outplacement data, the picture strongly suggests more companies are considering trims and efficiencies in the coming months. Still, the bank said weekly jobless claims remain low, which means government reports might not yet reflect the full extent of deterioration in the labor market. A recent Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report for September surpassed economists' expectations. But Goldman noted that claims tend to lag private layoff trackers by about two months, which could hint at a potential uptick in federal data about job losses as winter continues. And although concerns have grown about whether artificial intelligence is pushing companies to reduce headcount, Goldman said current evidence does not show that AI is meaningfully driving the latest layoffs. "While AI may be increasingly considered in workforce decisions," the Goldman researchers wrote, "clear evidence of layoffs directly motivated by AI remains limited." Jump to

Title: Bitwise CEO Praises XRP ETF Performance Amid Record-Setting Inflows, Here Are The Numbers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-performance-record/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T16:30:28Z
Full Content:
The launch of XRP exchange-traded funds has quickly turned into one of the strongest openings the crypto ETF market has seen this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley publicly celebrated the early success of his firm’s product, pointing to a surge in investor interest that has driven inflows to nine figures in a couple of days. His comments come at a time when total XRP ETF inflows across the industry are climbing, whereas Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of demand they had in the past. The Bitwise Spot XRP ETF started trading on November 20 after going live based on the new fast-track SEC guidelines for launching ETFs. Since then, the ETF has witnessed consistent days of inflows. Horsley revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF recently recorded roughly $18 million of inflows in one trading session. This huge amount is one of the fund’s strongest days yet and demonstrates that institutional investors are taking active positions rather than waiting on the sidelines. The CEO emphasized gratitude to those allocating capital to Bitwise’s product, describing the inflow strength as a sign of confidence in both XRP as an asset and Bitwise as a manager. “Grateful to investors entrusting Bitwise to steward their asset,” he said. The timing of these inflows also shows the bullish momentum across XRP ETFs, with multiple issuers reporting consistent interest since regulatory approval. This is interesting, considering the spot price of the altcoin has been going through a not-so-favorable period in November. According to Horsley, the Bitwise XRP ETF has now attracted approximately $135 million in inflows over its first three days of trading. This pace places it among the fastest-growing altcoin ETFs launched in the United States, although still behind early-stage numbers associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum products. These inflow numbers show the pent-up demand for institutional-grade exposure to the cryptocurrency. In addition to Bitwise, industry-wide XRP ETF data shows that the new products collectively brought in about $164 million on Monday, October 24. In total, the four US-based ETFs have witnessed $643.92 million in inflows since launch, with no day of outflow yet to be recorded. The strong early adoption contrasts sharply with the hesitation seen among some heavyweight ETF issuers. Firms like BlackRock and FIdelity are yet to launch their own version of a Spot XRP ETF, leaving the current wave of inflows to be dominated by Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. Their absence has not stopped the momentum flowing into XRP, though it has kept the scale of inflows below what it could become once the larger issuers eventually join the field.

Title: Dublin Airport warns of delays as taxi drivers to stage protest this evening

Dublin Stock image Dublin Airport has warned passengers of possible delays this evening as taxi drivers are set to stage a protest across the city. In a passenger advisory issued this afternoon, the airport said the demonstration due to take place between 4.30pm and 6.30pm, may lead to “heavier than usual” congestion on roads approaching Dublin Airport. “Some delays are possible,” it warned, advising those with flights to give themselves “plenty of time” for their journey. Airport Police will work alongside gardaí and local authority traffic management teams in an effort to minimise disruption for passengers and staff. The protest comes amid an escalating dispute between taxi drivers and Uber over the company’s recently introduced fixed-fare option, which drivers claim undermines the regulated fare structure set by the National Transport Authority. Uber recently introduced the optional fixed-price model, guaranteeing passengers a maximum fare upfront instead of the usual estimated range that can rise with traffic or route changes. Organisers have said that they “sincerely apologise” for disruption but insisted the protest is necessary. Some 1,500 taxi drivers are set to engage in a ‘slow drive’ at three points including Dublin Airport, Clontarf, and Phoenix Park, from 4.30pm this evening, before converging on Government Buildings. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - Thursday, November 27 It marks a second round of protests following demonstrations outside Leinster House last Saturday, with today’s protests sparked by the reported failure of the Government to meet a talks ultimatum by Monday evening. The company says it will reduce “meter anxiety”, and passengers will still pay the lower amount if the meter comes in under the fixed price. Taxi drivers are also asking Dublin Airport to stop facilitating Uber at the airport, saying that the introduction of fixed fares will have a “detrimental” impact on their livelihoods. Driver representatives say the model leaves many earning less during heavy traffic and have warned that further action is likely unless the issue is addressed. Taxi drivers fear other app operators will follow Uber’s lead in introducing fixed fares, ultimately weakening the role of the meter and increasing dependency on platform-controlled pricing. The NTA has been criticised by drivers for not intervening in the dispute to date. The authority has previously said that taxi fares are set under its regulatory framework and that operators must comply with those rules. The NTA has been contacted for comment. The future leadership of a government body overseeing the north-east inner city in Dublin is in limbo after former Fianna Fáil presidential candidate Jim Gavin temporarily stood back from the agency.

Title: The Only 3 Ways to Actually Make Money in B2B AI (And Why “AI-Enhanced” Doesn’t Count Anymore)

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai Most B2B companies claiming to be “AI-powered” aren’t seeing growth accelerate. Not because their technology doesn’t work, but because they’re playing the wrong game entirely. Path 1: Attach to Compute Infrastructure Path 2: Replace Human Headcount Path 3: Massively Displace an Incumbent Everything else is noise in AI and B2B. Let’s break down why each works, how to know if you’re actually doing it, and where most companies go wrong. DataDog’s 23% stock surge after earnings wasn’t luck. It was the inevitable result of a simple principle: sell to the people building AI, and as they grow, you grow automatically. “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies,” Jason explains. “They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds critical context: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” The hyperscalers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta) are deploying unprecedented amounts of compute. They’re not just buying different things — they’re buying MORE of everything: Here’s the key insight: These companies buy like traditional B2B enterprises, just at 10x the scale and 10x the speed. OpenAI isn’t some mystical different creature when it comes to procurement. They need observability. They need security. They need data tools. They need all the same infrastructure any rapidly-scaling company needs — they just need more of it because they’re deploying more compute than any companies in history. Ask yourself these questions: If you can’t answer yes to at least 2-3 of these, you’re not actually playing the compute infrastructure game. Jason’s prediction: “If you have attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Why? Because the infrastructure layer is just getting started. The capex spend on AI is still accelerating. Data center buildouts are still in early innings. The hyperscalers are still ramping their compute deployments. Every single piece of software that sits in that stack — from chip to model to deployment — is going to see explosive growth. But you need to actually be IN that stack, not adjacent to it. Here’s where companies get confused. They think, “We help AI companies be more productive, so we’re attached to AI.” No. That’s not the same thing. Compute-attached means your revenue scales automatically with compute deployment. It means you’re essential infrastructure, not a productivity enhancer. It means when Stargate comes online with $100B of compute, your revenue goes up whether you do anything or not. If you’re a project management tool that AI companies use, you’re not compute-attached. You’re just selling to hot companies. That’s fine, but don’t confuse it with the DataDog playbook. “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the path most companies claim to be on but aren’t actually delivering. The difference between real human replacement and “AI-enhanced productivity” is stark. Jason runs through his experience deploying 20+ AI agents at SaaStr: “We have Reply for Replit (we call it ‘Reply’). We have RD for Artisan which is an SDR. We have Quali for Qualified. They all have these little desks where there’s no human at it anymore.” But here’s the critical distinction he makes about Replit’s V3 agent: “It is the first one that jumped the line to not being one of the parts of our team, but literally being part of our team just like a human being.” What makes it different? It’s sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. Not “it helps us be more efficient.” Not “it automates some tasks.” It completes high-value work autonomously with the same level of oversight you’d give a human team member. Jason makes a crucial point: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story.” Here’s how to know if you’re actually replacing humans versus just telling yourself you are: Real Human Replacement: Fake Human Replacement (productivity story): Jason walks through how Gamma could evolve from Path 3 (displacement) to Path 2 (replacement): “When Gamma can do this — go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data on them last year from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, put them all apart, review them once, and then distribute them to the team — Gamma’s part of our team.” That’s not “AI-enhanced PowerPoint creation.” That’s replacing a marketing operations person entirely. “It’s not that far away,” Jason notes. “Not just make me PowerPoint. When Gamma is part of your marketing team rather than a marketing tool, there’s a lot of revenue expansion if they can pull it off.” Jason identifies the key shift happening right now: “The co-pilot was the 2024 story. It didn’t work. It was a ripoff. Spend $30 more a month on Office like no one wanted the ripoff. This year OpenAI and Claude finally actually got good. That’s why Lovable, Replit, Gamma exploded. Next year is AI is part of your team.” 2024: Co-pilots (didn’t work) Tools that made you more efficient but required constant human oversight and direction. 2025: Agents that work (breakthrough year) Applications where AI finally got good enough to deliver real value autonomously. 2026: AI team members (what’s coming) AI that’s sufficiently autonomous to be actual members of your team, not just tools your team uses. That transition from tool to team member is where the revenue explosion happens. Because when AI is a team member, companies will pay team-member prices ($50K-$150K+ per year), not tool prices ($10-$100 per month). If you’re building a company to replace human headcount: Jason’s right that most companies avoid saying this explicitly, but the economics are undeniable: “If you are not removing humans from the equation, you are going to be heavily discounted.” The market is dividing into: You have to choose which game you’re playing. And if you choose Path 2, you need to actually deliver on human replacement, not just talk about it. “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly.” This is the path that sounds most familiar to traditional B2B investors. It’s what Salesforce did to Siebel. What HubSpot did to Marketo (before Marketo became HubSpot). What Slack did to email for internal communication. But Jason is deeply skeptical this path works well in the AI era: “I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” In the traditional SaaS era, you had ~3 years before incumbents would really compete: “You’d be like, well, Salesforce or HubSpot, whoever, it’ll take them like a year and a half to decide if it’s worth cloning. Then they’ll launch something and it’ll be okay because they have smart engineers, but it won’t actually do anything. The first six months it’ll be so feature poor. Then after two years they’ll decide, should I put 100 people on this?” That timeline has collapsed from 3 years to 30 days. Jason shares a brutal example: “I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader.” The AI-enabled cloning speed changes everything. Canva is now “borderline competitive” with Gamma — and Canva wasn’t even a competitor when Gamma’s CEO was on the show just months earlier. Jason’s skepticism crystallizes around the most obvious displacement opportunity: CRM. “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” Why isn’t this exciting? Jason isn’t saying Path 3 is impossible. He’s saying it’s the hardest path and requires specific conditions: You need at least 3 of these 4: The Duolingo discussion illuminates why incumbent displacement is so hard for public companies. Duolingo displaced Berlitz and traditional language schools. Hooray. But now what? Jason: “Where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory sees the opportunity: “The next generation of companies that are going to be teaching a foreign language will be LLM-based. We’ve seen companies doing more professional, more interactive teaching using LLMs. There’s a whole ton to be done in terms of one-on-one instruction.” But here’s the problem: Duolingo can’t easily displace itself. They have a business model built around light learning at consumer prices ($10-20/month). The AI opportunity is intensive learning at tutoring prices ($50-200/month). That requires cannibalizing their existing revenue model. This is why Path 3 is especially hard for incumbents. They’re not in a position to displace themselves. Which creates the opening for startups, but also means you’re starting from zero on distribution against companies with millions of users. Jason’s answer: Only if you can’t play Path 1 or Path 2. “We can fund those deals as investors, but I think the first two categories are much easier — attached to the compute or replace humans — rather than just steal.” The math is simple: All three can work. But Path 3 requires the most capital, the longest timeline, and has the highest failure rate. Jason drops a truth bomb midway through the discussion: “We’re in the Captain Obvious era of investing. You either got something or you ain’t getting funded anyway.” What does this mean for these three paths? If you’re on Path 1 (compute-attached): Your growth should be automatic. If the hyperscalers are deploying 3x more compute and your revenue isn’t growing 2-3x, something is broken. This should be the most “Captain Obvious” path of all. If you’re on Path 2 (replacing humans): Your customers should be measurably reducing headcount or headcount growth. If they’re not, you’re not actually replacing humans — you’re just a productivity tool. If you’re on Path 3 (displacing incumbents): You should be winning deals against the incumbent consistently, not just in small accounts. If you’re only winning when there’s no incumbent, you’re not displacing anyone. The test is simple: Is your success obvious? Or are you explaining why your metrics are actually good despite not looking impressive? Throughout the discussion, the panel keeps coming back to what doesn’t work: using AI to make your existing product better. Jason is blunt: “Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage.” This is the Duolingo problem. They’re using AI to improve their language learning. Great. Every single competitor can do that too. There’s no moat in “we use AI to make our product better.” Rory agrees: “Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” In 2023: Adding AI features was novel and impressive. Companies could raise on “we’re adding AI to X.” In 2025: Adding AI features is expected. It’s like saying “we have a mobile app” in 2023. Cool, so does everyone else. The market has moved from “are you using AI?” to “how are you using AI to capture revenue in one of the three ways that actually work?” Let’s be explicit about what isn’t one of the three paths: Not Path 1: “We sell to AI companies” Unless you’re infrastructure they can’t build AI without, this is just selling to hot companies. When the AI boom ends or slows, your growth ends. Not Path 2: “We make teams more efficient with AI” Unless headcount actually goes down or dramatically slows its growth, you’re not replacing humans. You’re selling productivity software. That’s fine, but it’s not Path 2. Not Path 3: “We’re better than the incumbent because we have AI” Unless you’re 10x better and winning head-to-head deals consistently, you’re not displacing anyone. You’re just another alternative. Harry shares a data point that shows how much the market has shifted: A classic enterprise SaaS company grew from $400K to $3M ARR (10x growth). Five years ago, this would have generated five term sheets from top firms. Today: 120 meetings, one term sheet at 12x revenue. Why? Because it’s not playing any of the three games. It’s not compute-attached. It’s not replacing humans. And it’s not dramatically displacing an incumbent with AI. It’s just a good SaaS company growing well. That’s not good enough anymore. Jason: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” If you’re building a company or investing in one, here’s how to think about which path to pursue: Best for: Infrastructure engineers who understand ML workflows, companies with existing relationships in cloud/DevOps Best for: Founders who have done the job they’re replacing, deep understanding of workflow completion, strong AI/agent expertise Best for: Domain experts in industries with weak incumbents, founders with deep incumbent knowledge, situations with massive technological discontinuity If you can do Path 1, do Path 1. It’s the easiest and most capital-efficient. If you can’t do Path 1, do Path 2. The market for replacing humans is massive and underpenetrated. Only do Path 3 if you can’t do the first two or if you have specific advantages (domain expertise, weak incumbent, vertical specialization) that make it compelling. Jason’s final point ties it all together: “If you’re in software today and this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met.” But that excitement only matters if you’re playing one of the three games that actually capture revenue: Everything else — all the “AI-enhanced” products, all the “using AI to be better” positioning, all the sprinkling of AI dust on existing products — that’s not going to generate venture-scale returns. The market is telling us this clearly. DataDog up 23%. Duolingo down 25%. Same week. Both “using AI.” One playing a winning game, one not. Choose your path wisely. Because in 2025/2026, there are only three that actually work. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

NEXT | How to win the World Championship Hearthstone Tavern Brawl Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Real-World Utility, Not Meme Coin Mania, Will Drive Crypto’s Next Wave

For years, crypto has resembled a casino, with flashy trends, wild price spikes and meme coins stealing the spotlight. But beneath the noise, something very different is taking shape in the middle of this so-called bear market. The next major leap in digital assets is unlikely to be fueled by the latest meme coin or a fleeting trading frenzy. Instead, it will be powered by real-world applications and the development of durable, institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. As the industry evolves, a substantial shift in investment and engineering resources is underway. The focus is moving away from speculative”casino” behavior and toward more functional, enduring applications: everyday global payments, banking services built on stablecoins and the seamless integration of tokenization into traditional financial systems. This transition will mark the true maturation of the parallel financial system. A recent TRM Labs adoption report revealed that India, the United States, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil are now leading global digital asset usage. South Asia is also the fastest-growing crypto market in 2025. The next significant advancement in digital assets probably won’t be driven by a new meme coin or a temporary surge in trading activity. Crucially, the research shows that stablecoins accounted for approximately 30 percent of all on-chain activity, with total transaction volume rising above $4 trillion between January and July 2025, marking an 83 percent year-over-year increase. That isn’t the profile of a market anticipating the next viral trend. It’s the profile of a parallel payments and settlement layer taking shape. The last big boom was fueled by meme coins and quick-hit trading crazes. That era brought millions of newcomers into crypto, but it also cemented the perception of the industry as a digital gambling hall. Today’s landscape looks markedly different. Significant liquidity is now flowing through crypto spot ETFs. Stablecoin activity is at an all-time high. Tokenization markets are expanding. Serious capital is staying in the system, not just passing through for a quick bet. At the same time, hype-driven projects with no real utility beyond speculation are being flushed out. What’s emerging instead is infrastructure and applications designed for populations regularly excluded from traditional banking systems. One of the strongest indicators of this adoption-driven future lies in the emergence of a new class of financial institutions. For over a decade, neobanks were heralded as the future of finance, despite most remaining deeply tied to legacy rails, from know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and custody models to payment networks and physical card issuance. They did little for the 1.4 billion people who remain unbanked, and they still left users exposed to arbitrary account freezes and the same opaque systems that defined traditional banking. A new category, known as decentralized on-chain baking platforms, or deobanks, is taking the opposite approach. Instead of layering a sleek interface over incumbents, these platforms are building upward from blockchain infrastructure itself. Here, self-custodial accounts are connected through smart contracts, giving users real control over their assets, unlike the temporary permissions granted on a centralized bank ledger. These accounts also operate on stablecoin-native infrastructure, enabling cross-border transfers to settle in minutes and eliminating SWIFT fees and correspondent banking delays. Moreover, loyalty and governance are directly linked to network participation, rather than being obscured by unclear “points” programs. Critics point to new risks from key management challenges to smart contract exploits to uneven regulatory oversight. And while those concerns are valid, they also overlook that these systems offer meaningful benefits to millions who lack reliable access to savings, credit or affordable international payments. And this is where stablecoins change the story. This new infrastructure is paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption, where digital assets are used for everyday payments, not just speculative bets. As noted, stablecoin use has shot up considerably, with TRM Labs reporting that they now account for nearly one-third of all on-chain activity. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape around them is shifting in ways that legitimize these assets. The U.S. recently enacted its first comprehensive legislation for fiat-backed tokens known as the GENIUS Act. The E.U.’s MiCA regulations are now in effect, and Hong Kong, along with other major financial hubs, has introduced dedicated frameworks for these assets. These developments are now making it possible for banks, payment processors and fintech companies to integrate with crypto infrastructure without the regulatory paralysis of prior years. They are also reshaping real-world incentives, making remittances from workers in the Gulf, Europe or North America to relatives in South Asia, Africa and Latin America, not only cheaper, but almost instant. With trillions of dollars flowing through stablecoins each year—and clear legal recognition emerging in major markets—they are becoming far more than payment novelties. Given that 90 percent of them are pegged to the U.S. dollar, these assets are now functioning as an alternative settlement layer for the dollar itself. As money increasingly flows through this system, a tipping point will arrive: an infrastructure strong enough to shape the next chapter of global finance. It’s become very difficult to believe that the next bull run will still be driven by the old question: Which coin will be 100x? Instead, it is far more likely to be driven by the networks processing the next trillion dollars in real-world payments. And because crypto is shedding its identity as a discrete asset class and becoming part of the invisible infrastructure behind everyday payment transactions, that shift may arrive sooner than expected. Two trends are powering this transition: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the emergence of decentralized banks. Today, roughly $35.6 billion in RWAs is tokenized, with market-maker Keyrock projecting the figure will reach $50 billion by the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also outlined a plan to unlock up to $4 trillion in digital wallet-held assets around the world through the digitization of traditional financial products—a signal of how large this market may grow. Deobanks, meanwhile, bring stablecoin payments and self-custody to the mainstream while layering in credit, savings and rewards. They allow users to bypass legacy intermediaries and plug directly into blockchain settlement rails. In such an ecosystem, liquidity can no longer depend on speculative waves. It will come from continuous flows: remittances, payroll, supplier payments, trade finance and tokenized fixed-income products. At that point, market cycles will sit on top of a growing base of structural demand, not narrative-driven inflows. Ultimately, it is this structural foundation that will determine how far any future bull market can run. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch. Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware). But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%.

For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously. While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated: “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

OLED tech means these elite TVs offer incredible contrast and no light bleed. Here are our top picks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The best OLED TVs on the market today deliver beautiful image quality thanks to the self-lighting pixels that define this technology. What these pixels deliver are stunningly deep black tones and incredibly precise contrast between light and dark areas, in a way that LED or mini-LED TVs simply cannot match. Read our 'What is OLED?' guide for more on why this tech is such a big upgrade, and so sought-after. The best OLED TVs include a lot of models that rank among the best TVs overall, and come from the biggest TV brands, such as LG and Sony. Even Samsung – a TV company that had rejected OLED for years, has not only joined the party, but has topped our rankings here at times. Our picks of the best OLED TVs here aren't just ranked from the best-looking to the weakest, because that would put all the most expensive ones at the top. We've tried to be more discerning and helpful, choosing the best options for different price brackets and particular needs, hopefully making it easier to find the one that fits your need best. ⭣ Read more Why you can trust TechRadar's choices We've tested all the TVs here ourselves, and our TV review team is led by Al Griffin, an ISF-trained video calibrator with nearly three decades of AV journalism experience. He's trained our staff writers to balance objective testing of brightness and color accuracy (measured using high-end industry-standard equipment) with the more subjective elements of picture and sound quality – because you can't judge how an image looks to the eye based on scientific measurements alone. We're judging these TVs based not just on picture quality, but also the features they offer, and how that balances with the price. We provide ratings for each TV in the different sections we judge, as well as providing our measurements, so you can follow our decision making, and decide if your own priorities are slightly different. Each TV is vouched for by a member of the team, who's written up why they recommended it, as well as going in-depth on what we thought based on our review. Best overall The best OLED TV for most people This feature-packed OLED TV delivers stunning picture quality, excellent performance and a brightness boost over the C4, all at a competitive price.

Read more below October 24, 2025Replaced the LG C4 with the newer LG C5 as our 'best for most people' pick, based on our recent testing. Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG C5 OLED TV continues the tradition of affordable, mid-range greatness exemplified by its C4 predecessor, now taking its place as our best OLED TV for most people. While picture quality between the two is largely similar, a new Alpha 9 Gen 8 AI Processor here delivers a modest brightness boost, along with AI-driven picture and sound enhancements. Available in a wide range of sizes from 42 to 83 inches, the C5 suits everything from desktop gaming to your home theater. It’s a fantastic choice for gamers with a full suite of essential features, including 4K 144Hz, VRR, FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, all across four HDMI ports. The updated webOS smart TV platform uses AI to enhance search and both picture and sound customization, and it can be personalized for multiple users in the same household, using voice recognition to switch between them. Whether it’s for gaming, movies, or everyday viewing, the LG C5 is a superb all-purpose TV that offers excellent performance and value. Read our full LG C5 review ✅ You value versatility in an OLED TV: With picture quality that looks more premium than its price, excellent gaming features and a wide range of sizes, the C5 ticks all the boxes. ✅ You want an intuitive smart TV platform: webOS 25 is clean, responsive and easy to navigate with new AI tools that make setup, search and customization smarter than ever. ✅ You want a great gaming TV: With a full suite of gaming features, impressive performance and stunning visuals, the C5 is a perfect TV for gaming. ❌ You already own the LG C4: The LG C5 is excellent, but its upgrades are modest. Or at least not enough to justify replacing last year’s model if that’s what you have. ❌ You want the best built-in sound: Audio performance is decent, but it doesn’t match the C5’s stellar picture quality, and some rivals do sound better straight out of the box. ❌ You need HDR10+ support: The C5 supports Dolby Vision but skips HDR10+, which is becoming a more widely used HDR format on major streaming platforms. We measured the LG C5’s peak HDR brightness at 1,180 nits in Filmmaker Mode, which is a solid step up from the C4’s 1,065 nits. That extra brightness brings more punch to HDR highlights and adds realism to colors, which look rich and dynamic across Dolby Vision content. Shadow detail and contrast remain superb, with deep blacks and refined mid-tones in darker scenes. Upscaling is also impressive, giving HD and even standard definition sources a sharper, cleaner look. The only thing the C5 struggled a little with was screen reflections, especially when you’re watching in brighter rooms. The LG C5 uses a 2.2-channel, 40W Dolby Atmos speaker system with no DTS support. Its updated AI Sound Pro mode can upmix audio to a virtual 11.1.2 setup, creating a wider and more immersive soundstage than the C4. During testing, we particularly enjoyed using the TV’s AI Sound Pro mode, which enhanced every aspect of the audio, producing a brighter overall sound that may not suit everyone but we found it more engaging and immersive. The new AI Sound Wizard allows for personalized audio profiles, offering welcome customization even if some of the profiles didn’t quite hit the mark. Overall, sound quality is good, but pairing the C5 with one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars is the ideal way to match its excellent picture performance. The LG C5 runs on webOS 25, which builds on its predecessor with a host of new AI tools, including AI Search, AI Concierge and AI Art. The upgraded Chatbot can now offer quick advice on picture or sound settings, though it struggles with more complex questions. Voice ID is a standout new addition, automatically recognizing who’s speaking and then switching to their personalized profile and recommendations. Quick Cards remain a handy way to organize apps by category, while the layout of webOS 25 is clean and easy to navigate. The Quick Menu is still a strong feature, letting you tweak settings on the fly without interrupting what you’re watching. The LG C5 is a great choice if you want a gaming TV with full support for 4K 144Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM across its four HDMI 2.1 ports. Its Game Optimizer mode lets you fine-tune settings, while the Game Quick Card provides access to cloud gaming services, like Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. Input lag measures an impressively low 9.2ms, and gameplay feels smooth and responsive with no tearing and blurring. Combined with the C5’s vibrant picture quality and deep contrast, it’s one of the best OLED TVs you can buy for gaming. The LG C5 is a feature-packed OLED TV that offers premium performance at a mid-range price, making it one of the best all-round options for most people for movies and gaming. However, at launch, the 65-inch model costs $2,699.99 / £2,699.99. While the C4, which is still available, can now be found for $1,499.99 / £1,499.99, which is a big difference given how similar the two sets are. Yes, the C5 adds the brightness boost and new AI features, but it isn’t a major leap forward. Having said that, prices are likely to fall, and once the C4 disappears, the C5 will become even more of a clear go-to OLED. Our expert review: 1 minute summary: If you're looking for a cheaper way to get a 2024 OLED TV, then the LG B4 is for you. Although it's price isn't much less than the step-up LG C4, it's still cheaper, with further discounts likely to come. The B4 may be the entry-level OLED in LG's 2024 lineup, but I feel it outperforms its price, delivering a rich, colorful, accurate picture with plenty of detail. When I tested the B4, it proved to be a fantastic performer for movies, but also an accomplished gaming TV, with its four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting many features found in the best gaming TVs such as 4K, 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR and more. I found its during testing that its sound isn't the strongest, with limited bass and average virtual surround reproduction, and its picture brightness pales compared to more premium OLED TVs, but the B4 is still an excellent entry-level set. ✅ You want an OLED on a budget: The B4 is cheaper than any other 2024 OLED TV on the market and mostly covers all the bases. ✅ You want a cheaper OLED for gaming: The B4 is an excellent gaming TV, with four HMDI 2.1 ports supporting 4K, 144Hz, VRR and more. ✅ You want a detailed picture: The LG B4's crisp detail, rich contrast and bold colors suggest a more premium OLED. ❌ You want great sound: The B4's built-in sound doesn't match the quality of its picture, with limited bass and Dolby Atmos effects. ❌ You want the brightest OLED: Compared with step-up OLED models, the B4's brightness is average, peaking at 656 nits. ❌ You need full HDR support: The B4 supports Dolby Vision HDR, but not HDR10+. The B4's picture impressed during our testing, with its deep black levels, strong contrast and vibrant colors in particular standing out. In our review, we praised the B4's "exceptional shadow detail" and its Dolby Vision Filmmaker Mode, which provided an accurate picture with ease. We did find that its lower brightness made its picture less dynamic than what you'll find in step-up OLEDs such as the LG C4, but the B4's picture is still very good, especially for an OLED at this price. The B4's sound is average and while it does the job, it won't beat TVs like the Sony Bravia 8 anytime soon. While it delivers clear dialogue and has a good balance, its bass is limited and virtual surround sound effects lack impact. At higher volumes, it can even sound "thin and edgy" as we said in our review. For casual viewing, the B4's sound will most likely be fine, but if you're looking for a more cinematic experience, you'll want to add a soundbar. The B4 uses LG's own smart TV platform, webOS, and it's easily one of the best smart interfaces on the market. Quick Cards organize apps into easy to navigate categories and a Quick Menu, which we praised in our review, means useful settings can be adjusted easily without moving away from what's on screen. There is a large banner ad at the top of the home page, but this is becoming commonplace on smart TV platforms and is really the only criticism we have of the user-friendly webOS. With four HDMI 2.1 ports supporting 4K 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, VRR (including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia GSync), HGiG, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, the B4 has things more than covered when it comes to gaming. Its Game Optimizer is a useful feature that allows for easy adjustments to gaming settings and there's also cloud gaming app support. A 9.1ms input lag time (with Boost Mode activated) means the B4 delivers exceptional gaming performance and combined with the features listed above, the B4 comes out as a superb gaming OLED with a cheaper price tag. The 65-inch B4 costs roughly $1,499 / £1,699 / AU$2,795. When compared to the $1,599/ £1,899 / AU$3,495 you'll pay for the LG C4, which provides higher brightness and a performance boost thanks to a faster processor, the B4 doesn't offer the greatest value overall. Still, it is a well-featured and high quality OLED TV that more than justifies its price. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The LG G5 is the company's flagship OLED for 2025, and when I tested it, with its next-gen OLED panel, I could barely have been more impressed. Not only does this new panel bring spectacular color and contrast, but high brightness levels I didn't though would be possible on OLED a few years ago. Not only does it bring incredible picture quality, but it also comes loaded with the full suite of features I've come to expect from LG's OLEDs in both gaming and smart-based applications. I also found that the new AI-based tools in LG's latest smart TV platform, webOS 25, should give some users real help when navigating their new OLED TV. While it may be a pricier option than its step-down counterpart, the LG C5, I said in my review it still serves as "a best-in-class OLED TV option for 2025". It's easily the premium OLED to beat this year. Read our full LG G5 review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With higher fullscreen brightness levels and a new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode, the G5 is ideal for all viewing situations. ✅ You want a TV for wall-mounting: With a slim-fit, wall-hugging design, the G5 will look perfect on your wall. ✅ You want a premium OLED for gaming: 4K, 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync and a low 9.1ms input lag make the G5 one of the best gaming TVs around. ❌ You want HDR10+ support: While it supports Dolby Vision, the G5 does not support HDR10+, which is used on some 4K Blu-rays and streaming services. ❌ You don't want to use a soundbar: The G5's built-in speakers are more than adequate, but don't match the level of its picture quality. It deserves a soundbar or speaker system. ❌ You want to save money: The step-down LG C5 doesn't deliver the same brightness or color depth, but it's significantly cheaper while delivering basically the same features. The LG G5 introduces a new OLED panel called Primary Tandem RGB or 'four-stack', that delivers incredible brightness and amazing color and contrast. Now holding the distinction of the brightest OLED we've tested so far (it hit 2,268 nits in Filmmaker Mode), the G5 is superb in all viewing conditions with no need to adjust lighting. As we pointed out in our review "contrast, color saturation, and shadow detail all held up nicely even with my room’s overhead lighting on". A new Filmmaker Ambient Light Mode also effectively adjust gamma to suit your room's lighting conditions, meaning you never need to alter your settings. It also delivers fantastic motion for both sports and movies. The G5's built-in 4.2 channel speaker system delivers clear speech and effective positioning of spatial sound effects, especially when using the AI Sound Pro mode. A new Sound wizard also allows you to create your own sound profile (in a similar vein to the TV's picture Wizard) which could be useful for some users. While the G5's sound is perfectly good, it deserves a robust Dolby Atmos soundbar to match its picture prowess. Already one of the best smart TV platforms on offer, webOS 25 introduces new AI-based tools such as AI Search and AI Concierge that make browsing for and finding recommended movies and TV shows a breeze. Its Quick Card and Quick Menu remain useful staples of the webOS interface that make navigation user-friendly and easy. Plus, it runs smoothly with fast, lag-free performance. As we said in our review "LG TVs have fantastic gaming credentials" and the G5 is no different. Four HDMI 2.1 ports all support 4K, 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), HGiG and Dolby Vision gaming, plus it boasts an ultra-low 9.1 ms input lag time when Boost mode in the Game Optimizer menu is activated. Its Game Quick Card also has access to a wealth of cloud based gaming portals such as Luna and Nvidia GeForce Now. When it comes to gaming TVs, it doesn't get better than the G5. The G5 is a premium priced TV, but it delivers premium features and performance. That being said, the step-down LG C5 delivers a lot similar features and excellent performance for a lower cost and the G5 is priced higher than some of its rivals, including the Samsung S95F at launch. Still, given what the G5 does deliver, its pricing isn't surprising or unfair. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: Panasonic’s new flagship OLED, the Z95B, is a worthy successor to last year’s Z95A. It introduces a new Primary RGB Tandem panel that pushes brightness while delivering richer, more natural color detail. In our testing, it hit an impressive 2,107 nits. But Panasonic has made a commitment to accuracy over brightness. The result is that movies look refined, subtle and true-to-life, rather than simply boosted. But the real story here is sound. The Z95B takes a big step forward with audio. Its 360 Soundscape Pro system, tuned by Technics, has been upgraded with new drivers and a refined speaker layout. The result is one of the best built-in sound systems you’ll find on any TV. It’s powerful, immersive and clear enough that you can even comfortably skip buying a soundbar. That alone gives the Z95B excellent value compared to its OLED rivals. Read our full Panasonic Z95B review ✅ You want the ultimate movie night TV: The Z95B’s sharp, colorful and accurate picture makes Blu-rays and streaming films look incredible. ✅ You don’t want to clutter your living room with a soundbar: Its built-in 5.1.2-channel speaker system delivers big, immersive sound that’s good enough to stand on its own. ❌ You prefer watching with the lights on: The picture is good in all scenarios, but it's at its best in dim rooms, and the anti-glare screen isn’t the strongest for bright, sunlit spaces. ❌ You dislike fiddling with settings: This TV has a long list of advanced picture and sound options, and while you can ignore them, some fine-tuning helps unlock its best performance. Panasonic has introduced a new 'four-stack' OLED panel design in the Z95B, with separate red and green layers sandwiched between dual blue layers. This allows for a much brighter image than past models while keeping color richness intact. Our tests measured peak HDR brightness at 2,107 nits – impressive by OLED standards. But unlike rivals chasing sheer brightness, Panasonic’s focus here is accuracy. The Z95B delivers a natural, finely balanced image with subtle gradations and detail. Skin tones and textures look especially lifelike. There’s also an advanced cooling system to help the panel maintain peak brightness during demanding HDR scenes. In its most accurate presets (Filmmaker Mode, True Cinema, Cinema), it doesn’t reach the same dazzling brightness as some competitors. But what you gain is a consistent, refined picture. The Z95B retains the 5.1.2-channel 360 Soundscape Pro speaker system from the Z95A, but Panasonic has improved the driver quality and tweaked the layout too. The result is even better, spacious, powerful and immersive sound. In fact, we’d call this one of the best built-in TV sound systems available today. Dialogue is clear, effects have impact and there’s enough scale to rival mid-range soundbars. A handy “Sound Focus” feature ensures dialogue stays sharp even when you’re sitting off to the side. We rarely say this, but the Z95B is strong enough sonically that you could skip an external soundbar and still feel very satisfied. That makes it exceptional value in the premium TV market. The Z95B runs Amazon’s Fire TV platform. While it isn’t the slickest or most elegant interface in our opinion, it’s reliable, offers a wide spread of apps and integrates well with Alexa and Prime Video. Navigation is quick, and performance felt solid across apps and menus. It’s not our favorite smart platform compared to LG’s webOS or Samsung’s Tizen, but it covers the essentials well and many will appreciate its familiarity. Gamers also benefit from Fire TV’s support for cloud gaming apps. The Z95B is well-equipped for gaming. There’s support for 4K at 144Hz, Dolby Vision gaming, and VRR, including AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. Input lag is low, and the picture retains the same accuracy advantages seen in movies. The main limitation is connectivity. With only two HDMI 2.1 ports, rather than the four found on some competitors, you’ll need to prioritize which devices get full-featured connections. But the Z95B’s strong built-in sound system reduces the need for a soundbar, making this compromise less restrictive than usual. Panasonic OLED TVs are usually priced higher than the competition, but the Z95B launched at the same level as key rivals. Add in the fact that discounts are already appearing and this flagship is looking like excellent value. Factor in the built-in 5.1.2-channel audio, which genuinely removes the need for a separate soundbar, and the Z95B stands out as one of the smartest buys in the premium OLED space right now. Our expert review: 1-minute summary: The Samsung S95F has the reflection-beating matte screen of its predecessor, the S95D, but improves on it by maintaining more accurate black levels even in bright conditions. It also delivers spectacular colors and realistic textures. The S95F is a gamer's dream, with 4K 165Hz, VRR (AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync), ALLM and HDR10+ gaming support across four HDMI 2.1 ports and is a good-looking TV, with a razor-thin profile. While its sound could be better and there is still some black crush in darker scenes, the S95F is still undeniably one of 2025's best TVs. Read our full Samsung S95F review ✅ You want an OLED fit for all rooms: With OLED Glare Free anti-reflection tech, the S95F's impeccable picture can be viewed in the brightest of rooms. ✅ You want the QD-OLED experience: Contrast, brightness and color are all fantastic on the S95F, proving the advantages of its QD-OLED display panel. ✅ You want an OLED that looks premium: A trim profile, razor-thin depth, and an external connections box to keep things neat make the S95F one of the best-looking TVs around. ❌ You want full HDR support: Despite covering nearly all the bases, the S95D does not support Dolby Vision HDR. ❌ You want the absolute best black levels: The S95F's anti-reflection screen is useful, but it does compromise on black levels, which look raised compared to the competition. ❌ You're on a budget: Elite performance does come with an elite price tag, and the S95F sits near the top end of the OLED market. I described the S95F as " a sight to behold even compared to the best OLED TVS" in my review, thanks to its stunning brightness levels, gorgeous, vibrant colors and solid contrast. The real star of the show is its OLED Glare Free 2.0 screen, which eliminates pesky mirror-like reflections even in the brightest of rooms. Its motion handling is also responsive with a bit of tweaking, making it great for viewing sports. While there are instances of black crush, the S95F's picture is staggeringly good and it's easily one of the best I've seen in 2025. Tizen has never been the best smart TV platform, but Tizen 9.0, the 2025 version, is the best one yet. With a useful quick menu, access to every major app and hubs for app organisation – Game, Home, Daily+ and Ambient – Tizen is now in a better place. Yes, some settings are still buried in deep menus and are a pain to access, but that is my only real gripe with this now-great smart TV system. The S95F's built-in sound delivers punchy bass, effective placement and tracking of sound thanks to Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ feature, and speech is clear throughout. Where the S95F comes up short is in its narrow-feeling soundstage, which isn't as immersive as the sound on TVs from the likes of Sony and Panasonic. Some people will be pleased with the S95F's sound, but others may want a soundbar for a more cinematic experience. Gaming is another area where the S95F shines. It's packed with gaming features, including 4K 165Hz, VRR with AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, ALLM and HDR10+ gaming, along with four HDMI 2.1 ports. It also delivers an ultra-low 9.5ms input lag time as well as Samsung's Gaming Hub with cloud gaming options for those without a console. Picture-wise, the S95F benefits any game played on it. The S95F is a phenomenal gaming TV that gamers will love. As always, judging a flagship OLED's value is tough. While the S95F more than delivers for the money with its features, picture quality and premium design, its price tag ($2,499 / £2,499 for the 55-inch model I tested) will outstretch most budgets. The S95F is an elite TV after all, so its hefty price tag is to be expected. • Most OLED TVs are premium: 4K, 120Hz, with four HDMI ports • Brightness varies greatly and some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for gaming • Samsung OLED TVs use HDR10+, most other OLED TVs have Dolby Vision OLED TVs tend to be premium TVs, which means you're getting a certain level of features in almost all of them – they're all 4K, they're mostly 120Hz for gaming, for example, and they tend to all have four HDMI ports, and premium smart TV software. But they're absolutely not all the same. Some are much brighter than others (around twice as bright, in some cases), some have more HDMI 2.1 ports for next-gen gaming, some have better sound systems, and they don't all come in the same size options. It's important to consider what size TV is best for you, and to do that you'll literally need to measure the space you have to work with. Remember a TV that fills every available scrap of space in your living room might sound like a great idea, but you'll need to consider viewing angles, screen brightness and whether you'll be able to sit a decent distance from the TV to fully appreciate it. The LG C4 has the widest range of sizes of any TV we feature, so if you need something smaller, that's a great place to start. When it comes to HDR support, we recommend mostly that people choose TVs with Dolby Vision, because it's the most commonly used advanced HDR format on the best streaming services. Samsung TVs only use HDR10+, which is similar technology, but not as well supported. It's not a dealbreaker that Samsung's TVs don't support Dolby Vision, but as you'll see in our list, we prefer sets that include it. At the start of the year, at the big CES 2025 technology show, we got our first look at the new OLED TVs coming during 2025. LG has released the LG G5, which has taken a top-level spot on this list as our choice for 'Best premium OLED.' We've also reviewed the mid-range LG C5 OLED, though the LG C4 remains our pick as the 'Best for most people' due to its ongoing availability and excellent value. The LG B5 budget TV should comes a little later, though this year the B5 is only coming in two sizes, sadly. The Samsung S95F and has since been added to this list as the best OLED for bright rooms . This TV also comes in an 83-inch model for the first time – though that size will use a new-gen W-OLED panel (the same as the LG G5) instead of the QD-OLED panel used for the 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes. Samsung also announced the S90F mid-range OLED TV, in sizes from 42 inches to 83 inches. Finally Samsung will have a cheaper S85F OLED TV option, which is expected to be less bright. Sansui has announced that it will have a budget range of OLED TVs from 55 to 77 inches in the US, which we expect will start from about $800 based on last year's models – that's massively cheaper than the equivalent from LG. Panasonic announced that it will launch a new range of OLEDs, led by the flagship Panasonic Z95B, a model that has since been added to this list as the best for sound option Hisense will have some OLED TV options in some countries, but we're waiting on confirmation of what those TVs will be in terms of size and specs. Sony released the new Sony Bravia 8 II OLED, and Philips will likely announce new OLED TVs for the UK and Europe, also closer to spring. • Entry-level OLED TVs tend to cost from $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 • You'll pay twice as much for mid-tier OLED TVs and triple for high-end sets • Sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day are a great time to buy an OLED TV The cost of OLED TVs varies hugely depending on what technologies are thrown in with an OLED panel, such as the resolution, processor, build quality, built-in speakers, and more. But suffice to say that entry-level models sit around (or, more recently, just under) the $1,000 / £900 / AU$1,500 mark. More mid-tier OLEDs at larger sizes (65 inches and above) can double that figure, or triple it when you're looking at the cutting-edge high-end panels. You might also notice that you don't get that much of a lower price with the smaller 42-inch sizes of OLED TV – that's because making them so small relies on relatively new tech, so they're not quite such good value per inch. Sales periods such as Prime Day or Black Friday tend to include lots of discounts on OLED TV models, though – especially from LG and Samsung. • Samsung TVs often use its competing QLED tech rather than OLED • QLED generally has better brightness than OLED • Mini LED TVs have OLED-rivalling or beating contrast OLED isn't the only option for savvy TV buyers. Samsung's competing QLED televisions outperform for brightness, while the introduction of Mini LED backlights has only improved peak light output and overall contrast – the areas that OLED generally has the upper hand with, thanks to its per-pixel brightness control. It's a tighter race than ever, then, though it's worth assessing secondary characteristics for OLED and QLED screens. An OLED with a cheap processor may cause more artefacts and video noise, while a QLED with edge-lighting won't get the true benefit of its enhanced color and contrast. Format or feature support can be crucial if you're hooking up your TV to a PC, a games console, or a 4K Blu-ray player too. According to LG Display, the makers of the OLED panels that go into every OLED TV on the list - around 100,000 hours. For most folks that's about 10 years of TV watching and far exceeds the 40,000 to 60,000-hour lifespans of most LED-LCD TVs. That said, OLED TVs can experience something called burn-in when a static image is left on the screen for prolonged periods of time - so be sure to change the channel every few days. OLED is, for many, the premium TV tech of the moment. Though once weighed down by inaccessible price points, a flurry of cheaper mid-range OLEDs and smaller panel sizes has helped bring OLED closer to the mass market. Samsung and Sony's current TV lineups include QD-OLED hybrids (they combine OLED panels with quantum dot tech, utilising the self-emissive properties of the former and color enhancements of the latter) – we have a separate guide to whether you should buy a Samsung OLED TV, if you want to read more about them. For those with cash to splash, you'll be choosing between a high-end OLED TV and Micro LED – a self-emissive panel technology that Samsung has leant into in recent times, but which has proved difficult to offer either affordably or at mainstream sizing (88-inch is the smallest we've heard about so far, as of 2024). It's a more complicated picture than simply OLED, then, though for deep blacks and true-to-life color – at a size you can actually get into the average living room – OLED may still be the best choice. • Burn-in has traditionally been a problem on OLED TVs • Most OLED TVs now have ways to prevent burn-in, including Auto Brightness Limiting (ABL) • These days, burn-in is not a big problem or something to worry about Burn-in, also known as screen burn or permanent image retention, is a visual artefact that sometimes appears when a TV has shown the same thing in the same place for a long time. It definitely happens on some OLED TVs, but manufacturers have come up with lots of ways to minimise the likelihood of it happening to yours. There are three main ways in which OLED TVs can minimise the likelihood of burn-in. They can use image analysis to identify static images – TV channel logos, for example – and subtly dim them. They can gently shift the image around by a few pixels, something that your OLED probably does already without you noticing it. And there's a more brute-force approach, where the TV automatically dulls the brightness of the whole display when it detects a bright and potentially burn-in item. That latter one is the least popular because if it isn't implemented well it can be quite dramatic and quite annoying. More modern TVs with this tech, known as ABL (Auto Brightness Limiting) are much more subtle about it than older ones. Last but not least, you can take the DIY route. The default modes such as Vivid Mode on some TVs can be ridiculously bright, so changing them or using less blazing settings will make your eyes happy and reduce the risk of burn-in even further. Ultimately burn-in is all about heat, hence the name. And the best way to reduce the risk of it and perhaps eliminate it altogether is to manage heat better in OLED TVs. And manufactures are doing just that. You'll find clever heatsink technology and heat dissipation design in OLEDs from Panasonic, LG, Sony and more. We're not saying burn-in doesn't exist. It does. But the advances in OLED TV tech in recent years means it's much less of an issue than it was in early OLEDs, and for most of us it's something we don't really need to worry about too much. • OLED TVs usually have a fast 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate, which is great for gaming • The Xbox Series X's Dolby Vision format won't work with Samsung TVs • Look for HDMI 2.1 ports – ideally four – for ultimate gaming performance Arguably, all OLED TVs are ideal for gaming as they typically have a fast, 120Hz or higher refresh rate and pixel-level brightness control that helps fast-motion images look solid. Even so, there are differences between the various OLED TVs in this guide that can make them better suited for different gaming scenarios. High dynamic range support varies among the different TV brands, and that can have an impact on gaming. Samsung TVs, for instance, support the HDR10+ format, but not Dolby Vision. So, if you’re using an Xbox Series X console, you won’t be able to take advantage of its Dolby Vision gaming capabilities when playing on a Samsung TV. LG TVs, in contrast, do have Dolby Vision HDR support, but not the competing HDR10+ format. That’s not as much as an issue for gaming, however, as the availability of games with HDR10+ is very limited compared to Dolby Vision. Panasonic TVs support both the Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats. If you’re looking for a maximum 4K 144Hz refresh rate for PC gaming, you’ll find broad support for that feature among the TVs in this guide. In fact, the only TV that doesn’t offer 4K 144Hz support is the LG B4, which maxes out at 4K 120Hz. The Samsung and LG TVs in this guide each provide four HDMI 2.1 ports with 4K 120Hz pass-through. Having four HDMI ports on a TV used for gaming is important because it allows you to connect both PS5 and Xbox One X gaming consoles and take advantage of their high refresh rate capability while also connecting a soundbar to the TV. Like many other TVs, the Panasonic TV in our guide maxes out at two HDMI 2.1 ports. That’s not so much of an issue in this case, however, since the Panasonic’s excellent built-in speaker system is powerful enough that you don’t necessarily need a soundbar. • Brightness used to be a problem for OLED TVs • New tech such as QD-OLED and Micro Lens Array has vastly improved brightness • Some of the latest sets also have anti-glare screen coatings OLED TVs in the past lagged behind QLED TVs with regular LED and mini-LED backlights when it came to brightness. The most recent crop of high-end OLED TVs has changed the game, however, by using new technologies such as QD-OLED (a Samsung-developed tech that combines an OLED display panel with quantum dots which is used in specific Samsung and Sony OLED TVs) and Micro Lens Array (an LG-developed tech combining a layer of microscopic lens elements with an OLED panel that’s used on specific OLED TVs from LG and other brands, including Panasonic). LG has also introduced the Primary Tandem RGB (four-stack) panel to the mix, adding even more brightness and more accurate black levels and color to deliver brightness like we've never seen in an OLED before. These new technologies have now made OLED competitive on the brightness front, with new models such as the Samsung S95D, LG G5 and even the LG G4 delivering peak brightness levels that even exceed some mini-LED TVs, which are typically the brightness champs. The LG G5 and G4 and especially the Samsung S95D also use anti-glare screen coatings, which, combined with the TV’s high brightness levels, make them a reasonable option for viewing in well-lit living rooms. • We run a suite of subjective and objective tests when reviewing TVs • We use specialized equipment such as colorimeters and test pattern generators • We test gaming features, upscaling, viewing angles and use different AV sources When testing the best OLED TVs, we use the same criteria that we consider in all of our TV reviews, which focuses on picture quality, audio quality, smart TV platform, design, gaming features and value for money. Our testing is not only made up of subjective opinions about each of criteria, but also on objective measurements taken using specialized equipment – you can read our full guide to how we test TVs at TechRadar, or read on for a summary. Using different AV sources, including broadcast, streaming and Blu-ray, we’ll run in every TV whilst cycling through its picture preset modes, such as Sport, Movie and Standard, to determine which settings are the most accurate for different types of media. We do this to determine what the best settings are for watching movies and TV shows or a sports match for example. Once we have established which picture modes are best suited for different types of content, we then analyze aspects of the display such as its colors, contrast, black levels and more using reference scenes we have specifically chosen to best evaluate these. When testing an OLED’s picture quality, we’re looking for deep black levels and contrast, which should be better than many other TVs on the market thanks to the screen’s ability to dim individual pixels over local dimming found in LCD TVs – often this is determined by zones and the backlight’s ability. We’ll also look at the color’s vibrancy and punchiness compared to textures and details, particularly sharpness and true-to-life accuracy. Using lower-resolution sources such as broadcast and DVD, we’ll also test a TV’s upscaling, looking to see how effectively that TV’s processing can enhance lower-res images to be displayed on a larger, 4K screen. During these tests, we also consider the viewing angle from off-center seats, which – again with the OLED panel’s ability to self-dim – should maintain strong contrast levels and picture quality even from the most awkward of viewing positions. After these subjective tests, we then take specialized equipment — a colorimeter, test pattern generator and Portrait Displays’ Calman calibration software – to perform objective tests and record the results, taking measurements of brightness, color and grayscale accuracy, gamut and more. The first test we usually do is of the TV’s brightness. Using different sized white window patterns, we measure the the TV’s peak brightness on windows including 10%, which will show the maximum brightness we can expect from the TV itself, and 100% to test full screen brightness, which will demonstrate how the TV can handle consistent levels of brightness across the whole screen (this is key when viewing sports). Full screen brightness also gives an idea of how well a TV will manage reflections. OLED TVs have often been known to offer lower levels of brightness when compared to QLED and mini-LED. But in recent years, the introduction of OLED EX panels and micro-lens-array (MLA) tech means we expect higher peak brightness levels, but still lower full screen brightness when compared to other LCD panels. We use light controlled environments when testing brightness to make sure any other light sources, environmental or otherwise, does not affect results. We also test color color reproduction in both SDR and HDR to compare its accuracy when displaying different source materials and the maximum color gamut it can show on screen. We do the same for grayscale as well, testing just how accurately a TV displays gray tones from black to white. With OLED TVs, we expect color accuracy to be among the best in the TV market, along with grayscale. Gaming is another important aspect of TVs nowadays, so we make sure to test a TV’s gaming performance by analyzing response time, graphics and latency — all of which are areas OLED TVs often excel at. We also look out for features such as a Game Mode (for adjusting a TV’s settings to the most optimum for gaming), 4K 120Hz, VRR and more. We measure response time by using a Leo Bodnar 4K HDMI input lag tester to see what latency is added by a TV’s processing. We always aim to keep our testing as consistent as possible, but it’s important to note that some of our writers’ setups and testing environments do vary. We do, however, make sure that all tests conducted use the same criteria between all of our writers, also making sure that the equipment is similar enough to achieve the same level of accuracy. The Samsung S90F series OLED TV received a five-star rating in our Samsung S90F review, but isn’t included in this guide. The main reason for this is that the 65-inch model Samsung sent us for review features a QD-OLED display panel, while other screen sizes in the S90F series are subject to a ‘panel lottery’ where either a QD-OLED or a regular W-OLED display panel may be used in the TV. This means that our Samsung S90F ratings apply to the 65-inch model and don’t necessarily extend to other screen sizes in the S90F series. Our review praised the S90F for its impressive brightness, richer color than its Samsung S90D predecessor, and its crisp 4K upscaling of HD sources. The only areas where we found its picture lacking were a tendency to crush shadow detail in some presets, and a slight gray cast to blacks when watched in rooms with bright ambient lighting – a limitation you won’t find on OLED TVs with higher peak light output, such as the LG G5 (included in this guide as 'The best premium OLED.' Otherwise, S90F series TVs are an excellent option for gaming, with 4K 144Hz support across all four HDMI 2.1 ports, AMD Freesync Premium Pro format and Nvidia G-Sync, Samsung’s Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming, and an ultra-low 9.2ms measured input lag. The 65S90F model we tested is also a great value for a QD-OLED TV, coming in around £700 / $800 cheaper than the 65-inch version of Samsung’s S95F flagship OLED for 2025. LG G4: One of LG's flagship OLEDs for 2024, the LG G4 delivers superb picture quality and comes with all the features you'd need; both gaming and smart. It earned five out of five stars in our LG G4 review as it really is the complete package. It's not on our list as it's been replaced by its successor, the LG G5, which delivers everything the G4 does but with added brightness and even better picture quality. Don't get us wrong; the G4 is still a fantastic TV and if you can get a good deal on it, it's absolutely worth the investment! LG C5: The successor to the #1 TV in this guide, the LG C4, the LG C5 continues the LG C-series legacy of delivering arguably the best picture, features and performance for its competitive price in the mid-range OLED market. Earning five out of five stars in our LG C5 review, the only reason it's not on this list is because the C4 is still available for far lower prices. The C5 isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant knocking off the C4 yet, but once the C4 is no longer available, the C5 is likely to take its place. Sony Bravia 8: Sony's only 2024 OLED TV, the Bravia 8 impressed us during testing with its lifelike details and vivid colors, thanks to a brightness boost over its predecessor, the Sony A80L, that make HDR images pop. It's also a solid gaming TV with 'perfect for PS5' features and it has brilliant built-in sound. While it's a great TV, it doesn't hit the right price point like the LG C4, but if you want a more mid-range option with sound good enough to not need a soundbar, it's a very strong option, as our full Sony Bravia 8 review really digs into. Panasonic Z85A: A mid-range OLED TV, the Panasonic Z85A still showcases the superb picture quality we've come to know from Panasonic's OLEDs. Plus, it delivers a good array of gaming features and solid built-in sound. Unfortunately, it has to contend with a crowded mid-range OLED TV market that's dominated by the LG C4, which offers a lot of the same plus points of the Z85A at a much cheaper price, though otherwise our Panasonic Z85A review is pretty glowing. Philips OLED809: It's no secret that we here at TechRadar adore Philips' OLED TVs, mostly for their unique Ambilight feature; a series of lights around the frame of the TV that project bold colors around and onto the wall behind. The OLED809 delivers excellent picture quality for a mid-range OLED, but is slightly beaten on overall value by the LG C4 – it's also only available to our UK and European readers. Read our Philips OLED809 review if you like the idea of a TV that feels much bigger than it is, though. Philips OLED909: This is a high-end TV, using the same elite panel as the LG G4, delivering stunningly bright and HDR-rich picture, aided by the Ambilight feature. The built-in Bowers & Wilkins sound system is also a nice addition, adding real meat compared to other built-in TV speakers, and replacing the need for a smaller soundbar. We think the Samsung S95D is a little more versatile and better value for most people, but it's an excellent TV, no question, as our full Philips OLED909 review digs into. Philips OLED959: This is a truly elite TV, but puts itself in quite a niche bracket by coming in very specific sizing, and with a giant metal stand as part of the package. It's also pricier than the competition – and its 'upgraded' version of Philips' Ambilight tech was too busy for us, and doesn't actually feel like a higher-end version. Still, you get amazing image quality and top-tier built-in sound, so if you like the idea of a freestanding TV with awesome AV skills, it's well worth reading our Philips OLED959 review. October 24, 2025Replaced the LG C4 with the newer LG C5 as our 'best for most people' pick, based on our recent testing. August 27, 2025Replaced the Panasonic Z95A with the brand's latest flagship OLED TV, the Panasonic Z95B, as our 'Best for sound' pick. July 1, 2025Replaced the Samsung S95D with the Samsung S95F due to the latter's higher brightness and improved black levels.

Title: TPUs vs. GPUs and why Google is positioned to win AI race in the long term
URL: https://www.uncoveralpha.com/p/the-chip-made-for-the-ai-inference
Time Published: 2025-11-27T13:28:34Z
Full Content:
Hey everyone, As I find the topic of Google TPUs extremely important, I am publishing a comprehensive deep dive, not just a technical overview, but also strategic and financial coverage of the Google TPU. Topics covered: The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The difference between a TPU and a GPU? Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Gemini 3 and the aftermath of Gemini 3 on the whole chip industry Let’s dive into it. The history of the TPU and why it all even started? The story of the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) begins not with a breakthrough in chip manufacturing, but with a realization about math and logistics. Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load. At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare. This sparked a new project. Google decided to do something rare for a software company: build its own custom silicon. The goal was to create an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) designed for one job only: running TensorFlow neural networks. Key Historical Milestones: 2013-2014: The project moved really fast as Google both hired a very capable team and, to be honest, had some luck in their first steps. The team went from design concept to deploying silicon in data centers in just 15 months—a very short cycle for hardware engineering. 2015: Before the world knew they existed, TPUs were already powering Google’s most popular products. They were silently accelerating Google Maps navigation, Google Photos, and Google Translate. 2016: Google officially unveiled the TPU at Google I/O 2016. This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects. The difference between a TPU and a GPU? To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture. The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads. A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array. The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck). In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”). It loads data (weights) once. It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers. The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory. What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data. Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking: They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs) It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip. Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks. The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule. For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do. Performance numbers TPU vs GPU? As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways. The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data: TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7. Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA & others), the summary of the results is as follows. Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho. A Former Google Cloud employee: »If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome. The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.« source: AlphaSense Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs: »TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%« This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7. Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads). There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail: »If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage. In the long run, if I am thinking I need to write a new code base, I need to do a lot more work, then it depends on how long I’m going to train. I would say there is still some, for example, of the workload we have already done on TPUs that in the future because as Google will add newer generation of TPU, they make older ones much cheaper.For example, when they came out with v4, I remember the price of v2 came down so low that it was practically free to use compared to any NVIDIA GPUs. Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.« source: AlphaSense Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs: »I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.« We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment: »When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.« What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU. A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia: »The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia« In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium). Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely. Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs? Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs The main problem for TPUs adoption is the ecosystem. Nvidia’s CUDA is engraved in the minds of most AI engineers, as they have been learning CUDA in universities. Google has developed its ecosystem internally but not externally, as it has used TPUs only for its internal workloads until now. TPUs use a combination of JAX and TensorFlow, while the industry skews to CUDA and PyTorch (although TPUs also support PyTorch now). While Google is working hard to make its ecosystem more supportive and convertible with other stacks, it is also a matter of libraries and ecosystem formation that takes years to develop. It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example). The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well: »Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies. Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in. I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there. With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.« source: AlphaSense These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible. A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization. Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC. The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future). While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part. Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs. As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it. I believe outside of TPUs, the only real hyperscaler shot right now is AWS Trainium, but even that faces much bigger uncertainties than the TPU. With that in mind, Google and its cloud business can come out of this AI era as a major beneficiary and market-share gainer. Recently, we even got comments from the SemiAnalysis team praising the TPU: »Google’s silicon supremacy among hyperscalers is unmatched, with their TPU 7th Gen arguably on par with Nvidia Blackwell. TPU powers the Gemini family of models which are improving in capability and sit close to the pareto frontier of $ per intelligence in some tasks« source: SemiAnalysis How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get? Here are the numbers that I researched:

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investors are back in profit, in a promising sign of a December market recovery from the cohort that drove much of Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs in 2025. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders are back in profit after Bitcoin’s recovery above $90,000, an early sign that sentiment may be turning among one of the key investor groups driving the market this year. The holders of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) fund, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), bounced back to a cumulative profit of $3.2 billion on Wednesday, according to blockchain data platform Arkham. “BlackRock IBIT and ETHA holders went from being up almost a combined $40 billion at their PnL peak on 7th October, down to $630 million 4 days ago,” wrote Arkham in a Wednesday X post. “This means the average of all BlackRock ETF buys is at just about break-even.” With ETF holders no longer under pressure, Bitcoin ETFs may continue to slow their selling rate, which has seen a significant improvement since the $903 million in outflows recorded on Nov. 20. Bitcoin ETFs recorded two consecutive days of inflows for the first time in two weeks, with a modest $21 million in cumulative inflows on Wednesday, according to Farside Investors.The development is a welcome sign for Bitcoin, as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was the only fund to realize net positive inflows for 2025, according to K33 Research. The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management firm, with $13.5 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2025.Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say The broader spot Bitcoin ETF investor cohort is also back in profit after Bitcoin climbed above the key $89,600 flow-weighted cost basis, a level that was lost two weeks ago.Bitcoin’s recovery follows a sharp increase in interest rate cut expectations for the US Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, with odds increasing by 46% in a week. Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut, up from 39% a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Related: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined Two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s price correction pushed Bitcoin ETF holders below their flow-weighted cost basis near $89,600, according to Glassnode analyst Sean Rose, with the average holder facing paper losses on their investment. However, most ETF holders are “long-term allocators,” meaning that “being underwater doesn’t trigger quick exits,” Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Black Friday has passed, but the deals continue all weekend into Cyber Monday, and there are lots to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated November 30: We have reviewed the best prices and found some of more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout the day and throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $274, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: One-Third of Rich Young Clients Move Money Over Lack of Crypto Access: Report

Institutional wealth managers might lose young crypto investors due to the absence of digital asset offerings, a new survey shows. Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) became more intertwined with mainstream firms as users backed on-chain use-cases. A new survey conducted by crypto payment firm ZeroHash highlights the growing adoption of digital asset offerings, especially among young investors. Participants indicated that they are willing to change wealth managers because exposure to crypto assets is not on the table. About a third of investors are in search of crypto offerings supporting the position. More practically, over 50% of participants said they moved between $250,000 and $1 million in search of crypto products. This shows the skyrocketing demand for digital assets and recent institutional investments in the market. Meanwhile, 18% of young investors pulled out less than $100k from funds with virtual assets, and 5.3% transferred over $1 million. The majority claim their stance was influenced by heavy institutional accumulation in recent months. According to the survey, if large institutional firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, etc are increasing exposure to crypto, smaller investors should follow a similar path. Meanwhile, 84% of investors said they plan to increase their crypto holdings in the next 12 months. This adoption spike is expected after crypto assets like Bitcoin tapped all-time highs this year, with analysts tipping a bull case of $1 million by 2030. Short-term projections suggest a run above $150k despite recent setbacks triggered by mass liquidations. Crypto users became more bullish after the United States’ positive stance, prompting a surge in institutional demand. Most young investors now feel confident about the market’s future. Previously, several institutional giants refused to include virtual assets in their portfolios, citing concerns about manipulation. “Crypto assets have become essential to modern portfolio strategy with users not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up… Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the report added. Furthermore, 92% of participants say a broader range of crypto-based investment products is required, a move away from the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings. This year, altcoins like Solana and XRP recorded consecutive inflows into institutional products as the market awaits spot ETFs and more decentralized finance use cases.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases.

Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases.

Title: Aramco selects Citigroup for oil storage terminals stake sale
URL: https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/aramco-selects-citigroup/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T11:02:06Z
Full Content:
Saudi Aramco has selected Citigroup to advise on the planned sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals business, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The appointment follows a competitive process involving several major investment banks, with Citigroup emerging as the preferred adviser in recent days. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more Previously, the company mandated JPMorgan Chase as a sell-side adviser for separate sales of stakes in its oil and gas pipeline infrastructure. The proposed transaction could raise several billion dollars for Aramco, although discussions remain at an early stage. No final decisions have been made regarding the structure or timing of the sale, according to the report. The Saudi energy company is expected to begin a formal sale process next year, which may attract interest from large infrastructure funds. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This move aligns with its broader strategy to divest assets, including parts of its real estate portfolio, as it seeks to generate capital for future investments. Aramco’s oil storage and export network includes major facilities at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and terminals on the Red Sea. The company owns interests in product terminals in the Netherlands and holds leases for crude and product storage in Egypt and Okinawa, Japan. Bloomberg said that Aramco’s decision to explore the sale of a stake in the oil terminals business comes as the company responds to changing market conditions. Oil prices have declined by around 16% this year, prompting the company to delay some projects and consider asset sales to maintain investment capacity. While the impact on earnings has been offset by increased production, asset sales are considered a means to strengthen Aramco’s financial position. Citigroup declined Bloomberg’s request to comment on the appointment, and Aramco did not immediately respond to requests for comment, without disclosing further details of the stake sale. In September this year, a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, was reportedly in negotiations with several banks to secure up to $10.3bn (SR38.62bn) in financing for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development deal. JPMorgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are said to be among the financial institutions in discussions to support the transaction.

Title: Nvidia's bumpy November

After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company. Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant. But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path. Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way. Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had "nothing to do with Nvidia itself," the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk. Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang told analysts on a call following the results. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued. Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that "the market did not appreciate" Nvidia's "incredible" quarter. Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said during an all-hands meeting. It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker. Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips. While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction. Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started. And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are "a generation ahead of the industry." The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia. Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, "give-and-take deals" in AI. The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it," Burry wrote. "Its name is Nvidia." The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have "incorrectly" made some of his calculations. The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers. "First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets," the memo said, adding, "The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia." Burry called Nvidia's response "disappointing" and disclosed that he "continues to own puts" on Nvidia. While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday. The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been "off the charts." Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said "will grow" as more deals are struck. While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call. "As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator," he said. "We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Jump to

Title: Nasdaq seeks SEC nod to lift IBIT options cap to one million contracts

BTC’s V-shaped recovery meets Nasdaq’s IBIT options expansion. IBIT options expansion provides 40× more room for Bitcoin derivatives exposure, boosting liquidity, but persistent market fear raises questions. BTC is showing a V-shaped recovery, reclaiming $92k, but full reversal is still uncertain as options leverage peaks and resistance levels loom. The Q4 market cycle is prompting investors to reconsider the “store of value” narrative. From DATs losing purchasing power to ETFs bleeding cash, and big institutions selling to protect their balance sheets, Bitcoin [BTC] conviction is being tested. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are a clear example. According to BitBo, the firm has offloaded roughly 30,000 BTC since the October crash. And it’s not just their direct holdings. BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) logged more than $3 billion in outflows in November alone. Source: BitBo In short, institutional conviction in BlackRock took a hit this cycle. Yet, the latest Nasdaq–SEC filing looks like an attempt to reboot momentum around IBIT. According to the filing, Nasdaq wants to raise IBIT’s options contract limit from 25k to 1 million, marking a 400% jump. Simply put, that’s 40× more room for derivatives exposure in Bitcoin, putting IBIT in the same conversation as the “Magnificent Seven” in terms of options depth. But the question is: Is the timing right? BTC has bounced back to $90k, yet “fear” still dominates the market. ETFs haven’t fully rebounded either. In this context, does Nasdaq’s move give IBIT room for serious derivatives flows, or is it just another high-risk trade? The market reaction to the news is clear on the charts. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s Options Open Interest (OI) jumped about $4 billion in a single day, hitting $62 billion. That’s a clear sign derivatives activity is picking up, likely boosted by the expanded IBIT options limits. The impact on Bitcoin? Pretty clear. BTC is riding the bullish momentum from yesterday’s 3.51% rally, trying to reclaim the $92k level. In fact, this marks BTC’s first V-shaped recovery in nearly a month. Source : TradingView (BTC/USDT) However, a full reversal isn’t on the cards yet. In early November, BTC failed to break the $110k ceiling, forming two lower lows, the latest around $80k. In this context, breaking $94k would be the first step toward a vertical expansion. Meanwhile, options leverage is heating up, while the SEC has yet to rule on the IBIT filing. Still, the market’s reaction is already evident. As BTC nears resistance, how this leverage plays out will serve as a crucial gauge for traders. If BTC holds above current levels, the 1 million contract expansion could pave the way for deeper liquidity. Otherwise, excessive leverage could make BTC prone to volatility, turning the expansion into a high-risk trade.

Title: The new plan for Urban Planning Authorities, the Eurogroup on K.M.’s agenda with Weber, CVC sells marinas in a €1.5 billion deal, the Church and the auction

Hello, I find political news today less interesting than two other issues that are much more serious. The first concerns that tragic accident last Friday in Pagrati, in which an 84-year-old driver hit and killed a 75-year-old woman who was walking with her 30-year-old daughter with disabilities. When, finally, in this country will elderly people undergo serious tests in order to renew — or NOT renew — their driver’s license? It is time to put an end to an issue that literally kills innocent people. The second concerns the sudden work stoppage by STASY, due to a tragic accident that occurred in one of the company’s engine sheds in Piraeus. The work stoppage on the metro and tram paralyzed all of Athens yesterday afternoon and caused hardship to hundreds of thousands of citizens. The incident is tragic, but there is a prosecutor and an investigating judge looking into it and, if there is responsibility, it will be assigned through the Justice system. What is gained, and by whom, from making all of Athens suffer? Will working conditions change because of yesterday’s strike? Since the Thessaloniki International Fair, Stavros Papastavrou and Dimitris Papastergiou sat down to design how the reform announced by K.M. at the Fair will be implemented — specifically, the transfer of Urban Planning Offices from municipalities to the Cadastre. The plan has been prepared, will be presented today to the Cabinet, will begin to be implemented on a pilot basis in 2026, and fully by 2027. What it practically provides: integration of the Urban Planning Offices into the Cadastre Offices, both in substance and in the information system, and of course a reduction in physical contact points, through the digitalization of procedures. My understanding is that there will be one local Cadastre office per regional capital and one central office per region. Also, with the digital pool of cases, when one Urban Planning Office has a heavy workload, another with less can handle the work, without requiring contact with the engineer, the citizen, etc. Today at 20:00 K.M. has a scheduled dinner with the president of the EPP, Manfred Weber, who is in Athens with the candidate prime minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Manuel Hagel. Under other circumstances the dinner would be social in nature, but here it is obvious that K.M. wants to lobby on the issue of the Eurogroup and the prospect of the EPP supporting Pierre’s candidacy, who has just returned from Berlin. With K.M. at the central Athens restaurant will be Chatzidakis, who is also vice-president of the EPP, and ND’s Secretary for International Relations, Tasos Chatzivasileiou, who gets along well with the Germans. I asked my source who was describing the plan whether the matter of the Urban Planning Offices will stir up local reactions, as happened with the Hellenic Post. “Look, there are municipalities that react, but we do not want to put the mayors in opposition. There are also municipalities that don’t want to have anything to do with Urban Planning Offices,” he told me. As for the staff of the Urban Planning Offices, those who wish will be given the right to remain in the new structure, but if they do not want to, they will be absorbed into other services. I understand that perhaps even before year-end there may be an agreement between the government and industrialists on the issue of electricity and the subsidy that SEV is insistently demanding. After the issue of collective agreements, President Spyros Theodoropoulos has set course for an agreement and is in open communication with both K.M. and Chatzidakis. If I can make an estimate, the agreement will probably be somewhat less than what the industrialists wanted, but still—better than nothing… At the end of the week ND’s leadership will sit down to draft the plan for the party’s pre-congresses, which will pave the way for the party congress after Easter. There is information circulating that the start may be in Patras in the first ten days of December, but there is also the view that there is no point in doing anything before the holidays, as the party mechanism has already been mobilized one way or another due to internal elections. Therefore, the start may come in January, while the cities that will host the at least four pre-congresses will also be finalized. And we move on to market news with an interesting story about a fresh deal in the making. According to information, CVC is launching a process to sell D-Marin, the company that owns and manages marinas. It is a major deal, as the price is estimated to reach €1.5 billion. The Greek interest lies in the fact that included in the “package” coming to market are the marinas of Zea, Pylos, Lefkada, and the large marina in Gouvia, Corfu. According to the same sources, the sale process is taking place abroad. D-Marin owns 26 marinas in nine countries — Greece, Malta, Turkey, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Montenegro, and Albania. They sweated, but they are approaching the finish line. This concerns Masoutis and the acquisition of Kritikos, which barring surprises will be finalized by year-end. Initial estimates pointed to October, but it turned out not to be a walk in the park. The deal creates the third-largest player in the supermarket market in terms of turnover. Competitors argue that it will take time until the new entity is well organized and operates smoothly. Many shares of British gambling companies “went into the bucket” as the Labour government — making a dramatic effort to increase state revenue — decided to raise taxes on online gambling. The Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), imposed on online gambling, will rise to 40% in April 2026 from today’s 21%.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves aims to add over £1 billion annually to the state budget as a result of the new levies. However, the tax increase leads to a significant rise in costs for gambling companies, especially those offering online casino, betting, etc., with consequences for their suppliers and the entire sector’s chain. This may reduce profit margins, especially for smaller companies; some may be forced to downsize or restructure their activities through mergers or even leaving the market. Analysts believe there will be a drop in investment in the sector, as the increased tax burden makes the market less attractive.In this climate, the most affected shares were those of companies with high exposure to the British market. A characteristic example is Evoke (888, William Hill, etc.), which dropped 14%, while Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral, etc.) managed to absorb the pressure, and Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, FanDuel, etc.) closed in positive territory as it has significant presence in the U.S. Intralot, now controlled by Bally’s Interactive, was hit hard on the Athens Stock Exchange (-17%, at €0.92) due to its significant dependence on the UK market, since 60% of the new entity’s activities take place in the UK, where, among other things, it operates the highly popular online brand Monopoly Casino. Analysts consider the price of €80 million that OPAP will pay for the State Lotteries to be fair, if not advantageous. The company won the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) tender for the 12-year concession of the exclusive management rights of the State Lotteries. It will pay a lump sum of €80 million, as well as 30% of gross profit annually, with a minimum guaranteed annual payment of €20 million. In April 2026, the current contract for the Lotteries held by Hellenic Lotteries expires, so OPAP managed to keep them in its portfolio until 2038. It is also noteworthy that OPAP will now have 100% of Hellenic Lotteries S.A., the company that has been running the State Lotteries to date, since Scientific Games is selling its 16.5% stake. Yesterday we also had the management’s conference call for the nine-month results, but no news emerged, and analysts and the market now await updates on the Allwyn–OPAP merger at the upcoming Capital Markets Update. The legal saga of Folli Follie continues, and at the latest hearing (November 25), objections were filed by the defendants — D. Koutsolioutsos, Aik. Koutsolioutsou and I. Begeitis — against the participation of shareholders supporting the accusation for fraud and forgery. Similar objections were filed against the participation of HCAP and EFKA. All objections will be decided at the next hearing. Regarding the FF request, the court announced it will give the floor only after its decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendants — that is, at the end of the trial. Despite the fact that this procedural order is provided by law and was followed at first instance, in practice, for cases such as this, it amounts to a form of “penalty” against the damaged party, who ends up being heard last, when everything has already been decided. The trial was again adjourned, to December 18, 2025. It is worth noting that the hearing at the Court of Appeal was originally set to begin on April 9, 2025, but since then it has been constantly postponed — from adjournment to suspension and back again. Time passes, the case drags on, and the administration of justice is tested by its own delays. Early this morning, at the five-star September City Resort Spa & Conference operated by Hotel Brain, in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, the entry of Telis Mystakidis into PAOK BC (KAE PAOK) is officially announced. The entrance into the new era begins with an “injection” of 5.5 million euros from the new major shareholder, while immediately afterwards a large share-capital increase will follow. To make all this happen, an extraordinary General Assembly of PAOK BC shareholders has already been convened for December 17, as required by the institutional framework, with the main item being the election of a new Board of Directors. This process constitutes the final formal step for the full and clean transition to the new ownership structure. It is well-known that the Church of Greece owns large real-estate holdings throughout the country. Now, however, these are the reason it appears on the lists of electronic auctions—albeit indirectly. To avoid misunderstanding: this is not a hammer due to debts, nor is it being hunted by servicers. As the column learns, it is found—formally—in the position of debtor, with a private individual as the party initiating the auction, because she and the Church are co-owners, each holding 50%, of a “prime” plot in Thessaloniki. In this auction, scheduled for 28 January 2026, in the position of “defendant–co-owner–party against whom the auction is directed,” appears the Legal Entity of Public Law under the name “Church of Greece,” headquartered on Iasiou Street in Athens. The entire procedure is based on a recent decision of the Multi-Member Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, ordering the partition of the plot. It is a complete and buildable plot of 310 sq.m. in the municipality of Thessaloniki, on Polyxenis Antoniou Street, at the borders of the historic center and Ano Poli, near the Ministry of Macedonia–Thrace. Among the scenarios examined in the valuation report was its division, which was not advantageous, while the preferred solution proposed was either selling it as a whole or exploiting it by constructing a multi-story building and distributing the resulting horizontal properties. And so we arrived at the auction, which will take place with a starting price of €402,000. As for the ownership titles, they go as far back as a Royal Decree from 1952. In New York, Petros Pappas continues to be one of the few Greek constants closely monitored by the funds in the dry-bulk market. And it’s not only the financial results of the third quarter of 2025—net income $18.5 million, EBITDA $73.6 million, and an average daily charter rate of $16,634/day—that drew attention. Pappas’ philosophy continues to be read like a manual of financial discipline: the 19th consecutive dividend, steadily $0.11/share (with cumulative returns of $13.12/share since 2021), and above all, dedication to value creation through streamlining the share base. There aren’t many Greek shipowners talked about at trading desks for their buybacks, but Star Bulk has already “burned” about 5 million shares, investing $82.1 million, while another “wallet” of $91.4 million remains available. On Wall Street, this translates as follows: “Pappas knows what his stock is worth and buys when others hesitate.” It is the classic recipe of value operators who are not afraid of volatility, as long as the balance sheet can withstand it. At the same time, Pappas does not miss the chance to buy tonnage when prices are right. The three Kamsarmax newbuilding resales from a Chinese shipyard, delivering in Q3 2026, are read by analysts as a targeted bet on the fleet tightness ahead. The age fatigue of the global bulk fleet is now a given, while regulatory uncertainty—from U.S.–China fee measures to the postponed decision on the IMO Net Zero Framework—works more in favor of strong balance sheets than against them. The week in shipbuilding confirms a pattern that, on Wall Street, is now considered structural: Greek shipowners act as the most consistent source of demand for new tonnage in sectors with different cycles and risk profiles. In bulkers, Atlantic Bulk Carriers is methodically expanding its footprint with four new supramaxes in China—continuation of an order sequence reflecting confidence in future freight rates despite volatility. Pricing at $33.75 million per unit places the company in the “value buyers” zone, exploiting stable construction costs before new inflationary pressures appear. The moves by Danaos and Oceanbulk in container ships reveal a parallel reading of the market: feeder orders remain strong, as supply chains are being reconfigured and regional feedering gains importance. The fact that Danaos is closing a six-vessel 1,800-teu series at a yard specializing in LPG carriers shows the Chinese industry is seeking more flexible capacity use. Meanwhile, Oceanbulk’s two 3,100-teu ships indicate that Greek owners are operating in the “mid-size box” category, where the greatest supply–demand balance is expected after 2026. In the tanker market, VLCC orders have increased in intensity and frequency. Maran Tankers returns with four new vessels at Hanwha Ocean, while a parallel European order at HD Hyundai shipyards shows the crude-oil market is renewing a fleet that has aged faster than the historical average. Prices at $128–130 million indicate that shipyards have regained bargaining power and owners are pricing in resilient earnings over the next four years. The appearance of two LNG carriers in HD KSOE’s books is the exception proving the rule: the LNG market remains conservative with new orders. Workings and backstage movements at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization, where Vassilis Kikilias represents the country ahead of the electoral process for Category A, in which Greece aims for first place. Given that the IMO is the maritime arm of the UN, what I can tell you is that in the days before the elections, interesting diplomatic games take place with votes and balances as bargaining chips. The Greek delegation has a clear goal: to remind partners of Greece’s role in international shipping—not as a given, but as a responsibility it wants to continue serving. In private meetings, the minister repeated the spirit of his speech: respect for procedures, commitment to cooperation, and a discreet but clear reminder that “Greeks are people of the sea.” The three-member delegation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Athens, led by the well-dressed Czech gentleman and the exceptionally discreet Asian-origin lady, did not hide their enthusiasm after their meetings with the managements of Greek banks. SRB visits are never “courtesy calls” or filled with pleasantries. They arrive with a pre-prepared questionnaire seeking gaps in MREL capital adequacy, the ability for rapid asset transfers, and the readiness of IT systems to operate under emergency conditions. Particular attention this year was paid to the cross-border activities of Greek banks. It appears the inspection results were absolutely satisfactory—something they reportedly did not hide in their final assessment. Aegean’s market capitalization reached €1.3 billion, as it closely follows the trajectory of major European airlines hoping for an end to the war in Ukraine. The European aviation index Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines recorded another rise yesterday (+1.91%) and on a weekly basis its gains exceeded +5.40%. The index is composed of shares of 10 airlines (Ryanair, IAG, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Air France–KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wizzair, Finnair, Enter Air, and Norse Atlantic), all of which always trade at valuations lower than justified by their figures, as the sector is extremely sensitive to climate or geopolitical shifts. Over the past week—since even faint echoes of peace have been heard—there has been significant capital inflow into the aviation sector, and Aegean is benefiting from this trend. On 19 November, Aegean’s share price was €13.14; yesterday we saw it at €14.60. In last Monday’s session, 158 thousand shares changed hands; on Tuesday the number nearly doubled to 257 thousand, and yesterday, Wednesday, exceeded 100 thousand shares. AEGEAN continues to stand out for its cash position, holding €379 million in net cash, while implementing an ambitious investment plan that will allow it to spread its wings even to India. High-level international delegations have recently been visiting Sunlight’s factory in Xanthi. Recently, a French delegation led by the French Consul General in Thessaloniki visited the facility, while a few weeks earlier, there had been a large visit of Defense Attachés from 23 countries across 5 continents. The close timing and nature of these two visits are not considered coincidental. France, as the second-largest market for industrial batteries in Europe, represents a strategic market for Sunlight, which simultaneously maintains a long-standing international presence in the market for energy solutions for defense applications. The Greek multinational group Sunlight is rapidly strengthening its role in the new international environment, where energy independence, security, and technological innovation are acquiring decisive importance. Excluding Intralot, which we mentioned above (-17.27% at €0.92) and its issues with the British budget, which dragged down all shares of the Kokkalis Group in its decline, yesterday’s session was a victory for balanced growth. The sixth consecutive upward session pushed the General Index above 2,100 points (2,106.9, +0.94%) with increased trading value of €311.55 million, including €70.6 million in pre-agreed block trades. Banks performed well and raised the pace, but the rise spread across almost all blue-chip stocks, with a clear protagonist being the DEI (Public Power Corporation) share (+2.29% at €7.19), for which investment firms are publishing a series of positive reports these days. Eurobank (+3.62% at €3.52) had many supporters yesterday, and trading in the stock approached €70 million (€49.6 million in blocks). National Bank (+3.38% at €13.06) and Piraeus (+2.31% at €7.19) also raised expectations high, while Alpha (+0.86% at €3.64) continues upward steadily without spikes. Notable is the performance of TITAN, which again reached the price of €45.6 (+1.22%). The mere publication of the news immediately knocked NVIDIA’s stock down by -6%. However, the consequences are broader. Zuckerberg’s Meta (Facebook) announced that it chose Google’s TPU chips instead of Nvidia’s GPUs. In doing so, it broke the monopoly that Nvidia had built in AI infrastructure. Nvidia immediately issued a press release expressing its “enthusiasm” for “Google’s success,” while simultaneously losing $250 billion in market capitalization. At the same time, it reminded that “we continue to supply Google,” since Google still depends on Nvidia’s H100 and GB200 chips for the most demanding AI tasks. Nvidia did not want to attack its best customer directly, despite its “infidelity.” For this reason, it made sure to remind the market that its own chips offer “greater performance and flexibility.” It aimed to warn every other hyperscaler and every company considering following Meta’s example. But for the rest of the market, the message is clear: Nvidia’s dominance is being challenged. Its stock lost 11% in ten days. Google’s TPUs are cheaper, may be limited in certain functions, but competition has knocked on the door of costly Nvidia, and this is just the beginning of another war at the heart of Artificial Intelligence. The submission of the 2026 Budget by the Labor government in the UK targets all those who have chosen London as a taxation base for their income. Savers and property income earners will face a straight tax increase of 2 percentage points on income from interest, rents, and dividends. This means that taxes on savings income start at 22%, rise to 42%, and reach 47%. Dividend tax rates rise to 10.75% for basic-rate taxpayers and go up to 35.75% at higher scales. Chancellor Reeves has budgeted an additional £500 million per year in tax revenues from savings and property income, and an additional £1.2 billion from dividends. For decades, the London market attracted income-focused investors precisely because of the large number of companies paying generous dividends every year. Clearly, these developments also concern Greeks who have purchased apartments in London to collect rent, as they now face a new headache. The tax increase comes in a context of rising inflation, high living costs, and increasing financial pressures. Explore related questions

Title: Kevin Hassett tipped as next Fed Chair, markets eye dollar impact

U.S. bond markets remain steady despite speculation that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair in May. Hassett’s reputation for favoring rate cuts has sparked concerns that the dollar could weaken. Betting markets show rising odds for Hassett, while short-term yields dipped briefly before rebounding. (Source: Reuters) The dollar and Fed funds futures have seen minimal impact, even as investors price in an 83% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in December. Hassett, a former Fed senior economist, is considered aligned with President Trump, who favors faster reductions in interest rates. The market reaction may be muted because Hassett was already seen as the frontrunner. The field of candidates for the Fed chair has narrowed to a handful of finalists. These include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. On betting site Polymarket, Hassett’s odds have risen to 53%, Waller holds 22%, and Warsh is at 16%. Investors largely discount any risk to Fed independence, regardless of who takes the helm. Experts emphasize that the chair guides the committee, but the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee ultimately decides on rates. The path of interest rates will continue to depend heavily on fresh U.S. economic data, including labor reports and the administration’s trade and tariff policies. Kevin Hassett may be seen as less independent compared to other candidates, which creates some risk to the dollar and the Treasury yield curve. However, his traditional economics background could limit aggressive dovish moves. Experts caution that Hassett would likely not fully align with political pressures, even if he favors rate cuts more than Powell. The Fed eased rates by a quarter percentage point in both September and October, leaving the Fed funds rate at 3.75–4%. Hassett previously supported a “slow and steady” approach to rate cuts and emphasized that Fed policy must remain independent of political influence. Analysts believe fears of a politicized Fed are overdone, noting Hassett would struggle to push the committee toward aggressive dovishness.

Title: Americans in Ireland think of home at Thanksgiving: ‘There are troubled times over there’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/11/27/americans-in-ireland-marking-thanksgiving-think-of-home-there-are-troubled-times-over-there/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
One American couple’s “most memorable” Thanksgiving was when they got caught up in the Dublin riots this time two years ago while out for dinner. Tania Etter from Pennsylvania and her husband Marcus from San Francisco moved to Dublin seven years ago as part of his job. Thanksgiving, which Americans – including those living in Ireland – celebrate today, is his favourite holiday. “American holidays are very commercialised whereas there’s nothing about Thanksgiving other than eat, drink, family and sport,” he says. Thanksgiving has nothing of the “pretentiousness” of other holidays, he adds. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and dates back to 1621 when European settlers, or Pilgrims as they were known, were having trouble growing enough food. Native Americans taught them how to grow crops and the Pilgrims invited them to a feast as a thank-you. The couple were attending a Thanksgiving event with other Americans when the riots broke out in November 2023 and they couldn’t get home. “We walked south of Ranelagh before we finally found a taxi man who we could convince to take us home,” he recalled. “It was an adventure,” added Ms Etter. [ Meet the Americans moving to Ireland for a better lifeOpens in new window ] They have a tradition of putting messages in a stuffed animal known as Terry the Thanksgiving turkey that sits as a table centrepiece. Family and friends write messages of what they are thankful for. The messages become the tail feathers and after dinner, the turkey is plucked and messages read aloud. Marcus is thankful for his Irish citizenship which he received this year and their recent move to their home in Blackrock, south Dublin. “I just went back to America for the first time in four years for our business trip. I can absolutely and unequivocally say I do not miss it,” he said. He misses his family at home but Teams and Zoom calls make it “easier”. This year they will celebrate with a pre-prepared meal at home with their dogs. The Late Late Toy Show has become one of their holiday season traditions. “Our view is you can’t just be American and hold on to all your Americanisms. You’re living in a new culture, a new world, a new society, you need to adopt that.” Molly Coyle Shibley moved to Ireland in 2019. She is grateful to live here but feels “guilty” for family still in the US. Originally from Massachusetts, Coyle Shibley settled in Rathfarnham, south Dublin with her husband Tom while pregnant with their first child Nora after he was offered a job in Dublin. “I’m very grateful to be in Ireland for different reasons every year,” she said. “Last year, we bought a house. This year my husband and daughter’s citizenship applications were approved and I’m applying for mine.” Ms Shibley celebrates with the same group of friends every year. “They have seen my daughter grow up, they’re my family away from home.” Margie O’Rourke has been living in Ireland since 1987 and settled in St Margaret’s in north Dublin, where her husband, who she met in her hometown of Philadelphia, is from. “The major thing with Thanksgiving is family so it’s a weird experience being away from family,” she said. “Most people here are completely unaware it’s Thanksgiving.” She is thankful for her good health and that of her husband and family, and grateful for friends and little things like “the green grass and a cup of tea”. “It took me 10 years to settle here but life is good. There are troubled times over there [in the US],” she said. “Thanksgiving – it’s tradition and it’s part of me.” [ US students drawn to Ireland struck by hard realities of rental marketOpens in new window ] © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The filing, dated November 21, 2025, seeks to raise the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. It would place IBIT options in the same tier as major equities and ETFs such as Apple, NVIDIA, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. “The proposed rule change seeks to dramatically increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts,” the filing reads, adding the current cap is “restrictive and hampers legitimate trading and hedging strategies.” A higher limit would allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. "This will allow institutions to build more interesting structured products for IBIT, increasing the total possible amount of capital that can be allocated to the Bitcoin ETFs," Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, told Decrypt. "This should be good for long-term IBIT flows." “This is already the second time Nasdaq has requested an increase in IBIT’s options position limits,” Tim Sun, Senior Researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. The move showcases that institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives continues to expand as larger players seek to increase their Bitcoin allocations, Sun added. The filing requests an exemption to eliminate limits entirely for customized 'FLEX' options that are physically delivered. This move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets,” per the filing. It also cites IBIT's market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025, as key factors supporting the proposed change. The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, with a public comment period open until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a Wednesday tweet. “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here,” Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors tweeted on Wednesday. The scale of this change is “more modest than most headlines suggest,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. With BlackRock holding over $71 billion in Bitcoin, the increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs," Lim added. While the changes have yet to take effect, the adjustment signals that Bitcoin trading is shifting from purely speculative to allocation-driven behavior, the HashKey analyst noted. Despite no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, Sun explained it would allow institutions to build Bitcoin positions in a “lower-risk and more controlled manner.” From a volatility standpoint, Lim noted that realized volatility is likely to compress 50 to 100 basis points over the next six to 18 months, which “can translate to marginally higher prices through lower risk premia.” Bitcoin’s rally from $70,000 to $110,000 earlier this year occurred amid declining volatility. That negative correlation marks a fundamental shift, Lim noted, suggesting that if the Nasdaq’s proposed changes come into effect, Bitcoin will increasingly trade like a macro asset and would accelerate this transition. In a related development, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Bitcoin hit $91,500 on Wednesday and is up 5% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Title: Nasdaq seeks to ‘super-size’ option limits for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF

The push from the Nasdaq to increase option limits for the BlackRock Bitcoin fund shows Bitcoin markets are “breaking out of their training wheels.” The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the position limits for options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund to 1 million. Position limits exist to prevent any one investor from controlling too many option contracts on the same stock, thereby reducing the risk of manipulative schemes that could affect prices, according to the notice and copy of the filing from the SEC on Wednesday. The Nasdaq has requested in its Nov. 13 filing to increase the BlackRock ETF limit from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, as the exchange has seen an ongoing increase in demand for IBIT. A lower limit would impede trading activity and the strategies of investors, such as the use of effective hedging vehicles or an income-generating strategy. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, said the SEC is likely to approve the proposal because “these adjustments are routine once an asset proves it can handle real volume. If approved, expect thicker order books, tighter spreads, and a more efficient options market.” Nasdaq previously filed to raise the limit from 25,000 to 250,000 in January because IBIT was well above the trading volume minimum of 100 million shares. Liu said this current push from the Nasdaq to “super-size IBIT option limits shows Bitcoin markets breaking out of their training wheels.” Related: S&P downgrades USDT’s dollar peg rating to lowest score “Bigger bands mean bigger players can finally hedge, size up, and sharpen price discovery. A clear sign that crypto derivatives are shifting from niche to necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, Adam Livingston, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and author, said in a series of X posts on Wednesday that the move by Nasdaq places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF into the same category as the “largest, most liquid equities on Earth,” such as tech giants Apple and Microsoft. “They did it because the market has already decided Bitcoin is a mega-cap asset, whether Washington likes it or not. This is the moment every banker secretly feared,” he said.

Title: XRP Steps Into Its ETF Moment — Analyst Is Betting On A Rally Bigger Than Bitcoin’s

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and evolves, a new narrative is gaining traction that positions XRP for an upcoming institutional-driven surge that could redefine market expectations. With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as it pushes back above $2.20. If the move continues, XRP could reach the $3.00 region. Overall, opportunities have continued to emerge across major altcoins.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ethereum ETFs pull $175mln in two days, yet ETH stays weak — What’s wrong?

Is the market sleepwalking into a major surprise? On 24 November, ETH ETFs saw $96.6 million in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $92.6 million. On 25 November, ETH ETFs added another $78.6 million. RSI and MACD point to a short-term bearish trend, but these signals may be temporary noise rather than long-term weakness. At a time when the market is buzzing with new altcoin ETF launches, Ethereum’s quiet yet powerful momentum is being overlooked. The world’s largest altcoin ETF – the Ethereum Spot ETF – has been steadily gaining strength ever since it debuted in the same year as the historic Bitcoin [BTC] ETF rollout. And the latest numbers show that investor confidence in Ethereum [ETH] is far from fading. On the 24th of November, Ethereum Spot ETFs logged a strong $96.6 million in net inflows, with BlackRock alone accounting for $92.6 million, marking its first inflow in two weeks. Well, the momentum didn’t stop there. A day later, ETH ETFs attracted another $78.6 million, led by Fidelity’s FETH with $47.5 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA at $46.2 million, and Grayscale’s ETH adding $8.3 million. While most other issuers recorded zero activity, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to face pressure, witnessing $23.3 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. However, despite the strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the asset itself continues to battle a difficult price environment. At the time the latest ETF inflows were recorded, Ethereum was trading around $2,913.41, still unable to reclaim the $3,000 mark after falling more than 30% in a month, according to CoinMarketCap. This weakness stood in sharp contrast to the asset’s price action when ETH ETFs first went live on the 23rd of July 2024, when Ethereum closed at $3,418.61. But the current struggle isn’t about Ethereum alone. The broader crypto market has been under pressure due to a mix of macro events, including a U.S. government shutdown, shifting expectations around Fed rate cuts, and overall risk-off sentiment. Technical indicators also reflect this short-term turbulence. In fact, the RSI and MACD point toward a bearish phase, though these signals could be temporary noise rather than signs of a deeper structural shift. Source: Trading View Interestingly, this period of weakness has actually pulled major Ethereum whales back into the market. After ETH rebounded nearly 9% from its recent low of $2,623, whales became noticeably active again, breaking a month-long downtrend. On-chain data showed dormant wallets suddenly moving large amounts of ETH. Now, while Ethereum battles its own volatility, the broader ETF race is heating up. In a fresh development, VanEck has filed for a Spot Binance [BNB] ETF. According to recent SEC filings, the VanEck BNB ETF (VBNB) will list on Nasdaq and hold BNB directly, tracking the MarketVector BNB Index. The fund will not enable staking at launch, though VanEck noted that any future staking features would be handled through third-party providers with prior notice. This announcement landed just as BNB traded at $857.52, posting a mild 0.57% gain in 24 hours but still down more than 25% over the past month, a pattern driven by the same macro pressures affecting Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market.

Title: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes

Ethereum (ETH) is holding firm around the $2,900 level as improving macro sentiment, renewed whale accumulation, and rising ETF inflows strengthen expectations for a short-term rebound toward $3,400. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

Title: Nasdaq ISE proposes to raise BlackRock IBIT options trading limits from 250,000 to 1 million

Share this article Nasdaq ISE, LLC (ISE) has proposed rule amendments to increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. The fund, managed by BlackRock, provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. IBIT was approved for options trading on the ISE last September. The exchange states that IBIT’s current 250,000-contract cap has become restrictive, given the rapid growth in options demand for IBIT during 2025. Increasing the limits would support greater hedging efficiency, facilitate income-generating option strategies, and allow market makers to provide deeper liquidity. The increased limits reflect surging institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF options as Wall Street expands its crypto trading operations. Nasdaq operates as a major stock exchange and has been adapting its infrastructure to accommodate growing institutional interest in crypto derivatives. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

During his thirty-eight year career he worked on six-continents in field and… More Info Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is small cap, Houston, Texas-based producer of oil and gas. Its original focus was offshore in the African country of Gabon, but a few years ago it diversified through a beneficial merger that expanded its global footprint. The company delivered a strong Q-4, 2023 earnings report that included news of its further diversification and entry into Côte d'Ivoire. The stock rallied to nearly $8.00 per share following the release of that report. A mixed report for Q-2 that year took the wind out of the company's sails, and thus began the long slide to the current $3.33 level. Now the Q-3 report is out, and there could be some reason for optimism for a rebound in the company’s shares, despite a miss on EPS and revenue. At a glance, the company trades at low multiples and is currently well below its 200 Day SMA of $3.90 per share. This bodes well for finding a favorable recommendation on EGY. In this article, we will dig into the particulars on EGY and come up with an investment recommendation for the stock. First we will take a quick look at the macro picture for oil. The crude oil macro The oversupply narrative is dominating trading in upstream equities. Crude oil has fallen about 30% thus far this year and may not have yet tested a bottom. Compounding current sluggishness is the war premium that had added back ~$10.00 to the price has leaked away as two of the three international hotbeds of belligerence-Israel/Gaza, and Ukraine/Russia, have shown signs of slowing to a simmer recently, a step down from outright hostilities. Peace, while a noble objective, is not good for business in oil and gas, as fears of a supply interruption keep traders long futures contracts in times of belligerence. When things calm down, the contracts are dumped on the market and must find a home, at a price. One spot worth keeping an eye on is Venezuela, as the U.S. turns the screws on the Maduro regime. A war in our hemisphere, so near the booming Guyanese ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Stabroeck project, could have profound consequences. Geopolitical volatility makes it important to pick your entry points carefully when investing in upstream oil and gas companies. There is good news on the horizon for those who take the plunge, however. Fortunately, demand remains strong and has decades to run if the new forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is any guide. Fears of stranded barrels being written off on oil companies' balance sheets are less prevalent than a few years ago. The thesis for Vaalco Vaalco has been growing production since its merger with TransGlobe in 2022. This transformed the company from sole reliance on its Gabonese assets to a diversified player with a number of levers to pull globally. A move last year into Côte d'Ivoire was viewed favorably, and EGY just farmed into another offshore block in that country. In the short run, the company's focus has been on ramping up production in its Egyptian concession and Gabon. Results have been uneven with production progress and efficiency increases in Egypt, offset by a production turnaround and an FPSO refurbishment, combined with rig-related drilling delays in Gabon. This has pushed expected production from a new drilling campaign to the right, adversely impacting the stock. As the slide below notes, the shutdown and the near completion of the FPSO refurbishment, and then next the arrival of, Borr Drilling's Norve jack up is underway and should spud the first well sometime this month. Vaalco trades at a low EV/EBITDA multiple-2.8X, and a low flowing barrel valuation- $19K per barrel. Analysts here and on Wall Street rank the company as a strong buy. Price targets are $10.00 per share, but EPS estimates point to small losses over the next couple of quarters, which could delay any rally in the stock. The company has a quarter of its Q-4 production hedged at $ 60 and plans to increase this to about half. In 2026, EGY plans to hedge about 40% of its daily output. The company is returning capital to shareholders through a 6.5% dividend yield. The company has a small amount of LT debt and has been implementing a capital reduction and cost-cutting program that should improve cash flow and production. Catalysts for EGY An explorer's job is to find oil and gas. Full stop. Operating oil and gas assets is also enhanced by the adjacency of other assets. Sometimes this is called critical mass. It enables cost optimization through several avenues. Gaining operatorship over a block where seismic has already been shot for $3 million seems like a reasonably derisked proposition to me. Someone thought Block CI-705 offshore, Côte d'Ivoire, was prospective enough to shoot seismic, which isn't cheap, so it could be like the last person to pull the handle on a slot machine. Or it could lead to nothing. That's exploration. Dry holes are instructive as well. TotalEnergies, (NYSE: TTE) drilled a test in 2021, and DH'd it. Why did they drill it? Why does anyone think this area might be prospective? Well, if you go back 400 million years and put the puzzle pieces together to form Gondwana, you find the area now known as Côte d'Ivoire fits nicely adjacent to the areas known as Guyana and Suriname. That should cement it in your head as to what the Geo-types have in the back of their minds at EGY. This sort of thinking about the Atlantic Margin has led to the well-publicized discoveries in Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia. Snapshot of Atlantic basin (Google Maps) This is all down the road a piece, even in the success case. In the near term, we have the upcoming drilling campaigns in Gabon, Egypt, and the Baobab field in Côte d'Ivoire -EGY's legacy position from the TransGlobe merger. No catalyst discussion would be complete without at least a mention of EGY's 60% interest in Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea. As of this date, a Plan of Development has been approved, and a Joint Operating Agreement is in place. Although Venus (Not to be confused with Total's Venus discovery offshore Namibia) As the slide below discusses, there is future prospectivity in this block. And the two producers and one injector needed to bring on Venus could be done in 2026. Canada is taking a backseat after several successes in the company's Cardium and Mannville plays in Alberta, with no further drilling planned until 2026. The slide below shows the 2.50-mile horizontal section performing nearly as well as the 3.0-mile type curve. Q-3, 2025 for EGY Most notably, the company hit the upper range of most production estimates, but cash flow suffered due to softness in Brent prices. Guidance for the full year expects 5% uplift YoY. Capex was reduced due to the issues with Gabon to optimize cash flow for the quarter. Even so, the company had to call upon its revolver for current expenses. Otherwise, the company has no debt. Company filings Risks to the thesis for EGY Even great deals can get cheaper. Picking an entry point can be frustrating as fundamentals continue to weaken. That's the era we are in right now. As I laid out in the Macro, there are many moving pieces driving oil prices, and most of them are not supportive. No matter how good the price of EGY stock looks relative to the recent past, it can always get cheaper when the market turns against upstream investors. Your takeaway EGY’s report reads pretty well. And EGY management is due some deference for their experience in West African operations, going back decades. Their balance sheet management also speaks well for the company. Borrowing money to support operations when interruptions in other projects present cash flow hiccups is no big deal. The company retains ample liquidity, assuming refurbishment with the FPSO goes according to plan. In my view, Vaalco's strong balance sheet, prospects for improving cash flow in the next year, and low multiples, put a buy target squarely on the company at its current level. The company is currently trading in a range well below its 50 and 200 day SMAs, which is probably more induced by the depressed pricing of Brent than anything else. I am giving EGY a Strong for investors with a high risk profile, seeking capital growth and competitive shareholder returns.

Title: Shoppers opt for basics over luxury goods this Black Friday over economic anxieties: report

Black Friday is going to the dogs. A growing number of shoppers are taking advantage of deep discounts this holiday season to scoop up everyday items like dog and cat food, detergent, socks and underwear — and not luxury items — as consumers fret about job security and the rising cost of living, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. More than six in 10 shoppers recently said they planned to buy the bare necessities instead of fancier items during sales, according to consultancy Deloitte. Last year, 58% of survey respondents said the same thing. Flagstaff, Ariz.-resident Eilise Fisher reportedly plans to stock up on 40-pound bags of Purina kibble for her rescue dogs. In years past, the government worker shopped for a new TV or a high-end Dutch oven, she told Bloomberg. “We’re seeing a strong early surge in sales this Black Friday and Cyber Monday season,” Dan Schaefer, CEO of dog supplement company Native Pet, told The Post. “Pet parents are stocking up on supplements.” Consumers like Fisher are jittery about their finances as a growing number of companies announce layoffs and inflation rages across the country, experts say. Shifts in President Trump’s tariff policy have added to the uncertainty, experts said. So, customers are using the Mecca of shopping days to restock on essentials or give practical presents like gift cards instead of splashing out. Those who plan to shop on Black Friday and Cyber Monday expect to spend an average of $622 – roughly 4% less than last year — according to a Deloitte survey of 1,200 US consumers. “The uncertainty around tariffs has gotten so out of hand that we can expect people to stock up on coffee and electronics in particular,” Wallet Hub analyst Chip Lupo told The Post. As a taste of things to come on Black Friday, Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray was highlighted as a bestseller during Amazon Prime’s sale this summer. “It’s hard to not feel like things are less affordable,” Megan Hamand, a San Diego, Calif.-based financial auditor, told Bloomberg. She said her husband is getting a decidedly boring but practical gift for the holidays: an external hard drive. For herself, she’s stocking up on basic beauty products she uses year-round like $40 Bobbi Brown mascara and $28 Coola sunscreen. High-income households account for a greater share of consumer spending than in years past. The richest 10% of Americans did nearly half of all such spending in the second quarter of the year, Bloomberg reported, citing a Moody’s Analytics analysis. “More consumers are showing budget consciousness and choosiness in how they spend, which means more necessities over discretionary [items],” KPMG economist Diane Swonk told the outlet.

Title: NYC Comptroller Calls for City Pensions to Drop BlackRock, Fidelity, PanAgora
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/nyc-comptroller-calls-for-city-pensions-to-drop-blackrock-fidelity-panagora/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T21:44:21Z

Brad Lander has recommended three of the city’s five pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, the trustee and fiduciary for the city’s five pension funds, recommended that three of the funds drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management because the asset managers have “inadequate decarbonization plans.” BlackRock, which manages $42.3 billion worth of index funds for the pension funds, as well as Fidelity and PanAgora, were found to have “failed to meet the systems’ climate expectations,” Lander said in a statement. Lander, who is leaving office on January 1 at the end of his term, said Wednesday he has updated the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan for the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. In the update, Lander recommended that the three pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates and terminate those of active managers Fidelity and PanAgora. The comptroller made the recommendation after an evaluation of the pension funds’ 49 public-market managers. While 46 of the systems’ public-market managers submitted decarbonization plans that meet the requirements of the Net Zero Implementation Plans, the three asset managers failed to meet the pension funds’ climate expectations. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The trustees of NYCERS, TRS and BERS adopted net zero implementation plans in 2023, in which they committed their funds to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040, according to Lander. This includes committing the funds to interim targets and to disclosing emissions; engaging asset managers and portfolio companies to adopt net-zero policies; investing in climate change solutions; and divesting to lower risk, according to information Lander released. According to the comptroller’s office, the pension funds collectively have reduced financed greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 2019, divested from fossil fuel reserve owners, and grew their climate-related investments to $11.9 billion, while registering a 10.5% return for fiscal 2025 that beat its actuarial target by 350 basis points. “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said in a statement. “I am calling on my fellow trustees to move our money away from the three asset managers—BlackRock, Fidelity, and PanAgora—who fail to address climate risk with the seriousness we expect.” Lander said that after the administration of President Donald Trump changed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s requirements that public companies must disclose climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions, BlackRock ended engaging with U.S. companies on proxy voting issues in situations when the manager owns at least a 5% share. Because of the disengagement, Lander said BlackRock “does not sufficiently encourage portfolio companies to take concrete decarbonization actions.” Although BlackRock expanded access to its climate and decarbonization stewardship policy, it still fails to meet the pension funds’ expectations, according to Lander. The comptroller’s office also alleged that Fidelity has taken an “overly restrictive” interpretation of SEC guidance for companies in the U.S. and abroad to prevent influencing them about decarbonization, “even when such action is financially material.” Due to this, Lander is recommending that TRS terminate Fidelity’s world ex-U.S. small-cap mandate and reallocate its $384 million in assets away from firm. Additionally, Lander said investment firm PanAgora’s climate-related engagement only concerns disclosing emissions and “fails to encourage companies to take decarbonization actions,” such as setting emissions targets or adopting transition plans. As a result, Lander recommended that NYCERS and TRS drop PanAgora’s U.S. small-cap equity mandate. BlackRock, in a response to Lander posted on social media, stated that the firm had met earlier in November with the New York City Bureau of Asset Management, which houses the pension funds’ investment team, and updated BAM on the firm’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. BlackRock’s response also accused the outgoing Lander of “politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” BlackRock also noted that any changes to the pension funds’ investment mandates would require review by the funds’ boards, the BAM investment team and other stakeholders. “Should they take up your recommendation, we look forward to demonstrating the breadth and depth of our capabilities and the tremendous value we deliver,” wrote BlackRock’s Armando Senra, managing director and head of its Americas institutional business. Responses from Fidelity and PanAgora were not immediately available.

Title: Tokenized money market funds surge to $9B, BIS warns of new risks

Onchain money market funds have grown nearly 10-fold since 2023, but the Bank for International Settlements warns their adoption brings new liquidity and contagion risks. Tokenized money market funds are emerging as one of the most important yield-bearing assets on public blockchains, offering money-market returns and securities-level protections that stablecoins can’t provide, according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the bulletin, tokenized money market funds now hold nearly $9 billion in assets, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. The BIS warned that as these tokenized Treasury portfolios become a key source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem, they also bring new operational and liquidity risks. Tokenized money market funds are blockchain-based representations of traditional money market portfolios, providing investors with onchain access to short-term, interest-bearing assets, such as US Treasurys. The BIS noted that while these tokens offer the flexibility of stablecoins, they depend on permissioned wallets, offchain market plumbing and a small set of large holders; factors that could accelerate stress if redemptions spike or onchain liquidity thins out. Although the tokens move on public blockchains, the underlying portfolios, pricing and settlement still occur in traditional markets. BIS says that gap creates a structural mismatch: token transfers settle instantly, while the assets behind them do not. During periods of heavy withdrawals, this gap may make it more challenging for funds to meet redemptions without contributing to further volatility. Interlinkages with stablecoins create additional risk, as some tokenized money market funds also enable rapid conversions into stablecoins or are used for leveraged trades. The BIS warns that these feedback loops could allow market stress to spread much faster than in traditional money market funds. The analysis was released just a day after the institution appointed International Monetary Fund chief and CBDC backer Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli as the next head of its Innovation Hub. Related: Tokenized money market funds emerge as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins The world’s top asset managers have been accelerating the expansion of tokenized money market funds across multiple blockchain networks. Franklin Templeton announced on Nov. 12 the integration of its Benji tokenization platform with the Canton Network, bringing tokenized assets — including its onchain US government money market fund — into a blockchain ecosystem designed for financial institutions. Asset manager BlackRock also recently announced the expansion of its tokenized money market fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon, broadening beyond Ethereum. RWA.xyz data shows that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) currently dominates the onchain money market landscape, with more than $2.5 billion in tokenized assets. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund has over $844 million in tokenized US government securities, according to the data.

Title: ‘Low-hire, low-fire’ economy grinds on as lower-than-expected jobless claims suggests layoffs aren’t spiking

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits declined last week in a sign that overall layoffs remain low, even as several high-profile companies have announced job cuts. U.S. applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 22 dropped 6,000 from the previous week to 216,000, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The figure is below the 230,000 forecast by economists, according to a survey by data provider FactSet. Applications for unemployment aid are seen as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. The job cuts announced recently by large companies such as UPS and Amazon typically take weeks or months to fully implement and may not yet be reflected in the claims data. The four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, dropped 1,000 to 223,750. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state that has kept the unemployment rate historically low, but has left those out of work struggling to find a new job. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Nov. 15 rose 7,000 to 1.96 million, the government said. The increase is a sign that the unemployed are taking longer to find new work. Last week, the government said that hiring picked up a bit in September, when employers added 119,000 new jobs. Yet the report also showed employers had shed jobs in August. And the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, as more Americans came off the sidelines to look for work but did not all immediately find jobs. On Tuesday, the government reported that retail sales slowed in September after three months of healthy increases. Consumer confidence plunged to its second-lowest level in five years, while wholesale inflation eased a bit. The data suggests that both the economy and inflation are slowing, which boosted financial markets’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce its key interest rate at its next meeting Dec. 9-10.

Title: European Fintech Draws in Investors Seeking Refuge From Wall Street’s AI Bubble (Dmytro Spilka)

As fears on Wall Street mount over the sustainability of the AI boom, Europe’s fintechs are showing their worth. Recently, WIRED author Brian Merchant spoke to University of Maryland economists Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch, who devised their own scale for assessing whether certain innovations led to a market bubble. The economists analyzed 58 historical examples of tech bubbles and broke them down to their core components to create a scale from one to eight, where eight is the most likely to predict a bubble. Looking at factors like uncertainty, pure plays, novice investors, and narratives around commercial innovations, Goldfarb concluded that the AI bull run is a fully fledged eight. While this doesn’t confirm that we’re in a bubble, it shows that all the hallmarks are present. Billionaire Peter Thiel recently offloaded his entire stake in leading AI stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), according to 13F filings by Thiel Macro LLC. The total sell-off amounted to 537,742 shares in the chipmaker in Q3. Michael Burry, the investor who inspired The Big Short, also opened short positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting that each stock is set to decline in value. The outlook for Wall Street AI firms is becoming increasingly clouded as concerns over a growing bubble mount. But in Europe, there’s a more optimistic tone surrounding the continent’s fintech sector. Could European fintech be an antidote to the artificial intelligence bubble? Let’s take a deeper look at a market that’s gathering momentum: European fintech is growing at a rapid pace. Forecasts suggest that the continent’s Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) market size is set to expand from a value of $2.46 billion in 2024 to $18.32 billion by 2033, representing a CAGR of 25.2%. This expected growth comes despite the recent news that leading UK-based fintechs Revolut and Wise are reportedly eyeing listings in the United States. “The jewel in the crown of European fintech is Adyen (AMS: ADYEN), which has a capitalization of €43.04 billion ($49.9bn) and provides flexible cross-border payment solutions for merchants at scale,” said Iván Marchena, Senior Economist at global brokerage brand Just2Trade. “Crucially, Adyen’s client list spans a wide range of sectors and features names like Uber, Netflix, and Spotify. At a time when there are tangible concerns over the self-funding cycle of AI giants on Wall Street, we’re seeing more fintechs build a sustainable client pool that could help to ensure their longevity.” Platforms like Klarna, which serve more than 100 million customers in 17 countries, are an example of the immediate success that many European fintechs have found in immediately accessing major international markets with their services. There are signs that Europe’s fintech ecosystem is gathering momentum. Flatpay, which facilitates card payments for SMBs, recently reached a value of $1 billion. The startup has already sought to take on its larger rivals by introducing a flat transaction rate for merchants to use its card terminals and point-of-sale systems. Impressively, the Danish startup has claimed that it has grown from 7,000 customers in April 2024 to 60,000 today. Flatpay’s own valuation has also grown exponentially and is now valued at €1.5 billion ($1.75bn). Given its high growth rate, CEO and co-founder Sander Janca-Jensen is now targeting annual recurring revenue (ARR) to solidify Flatpay’s emergence into a profitable European fintech platform. Europe is also becoming a key location for blockchain innovations in the fintech landscape. MQube, a platform that tokenizes mortgage debt by converting financial assets into digital tokens and recording them on a shared ledger, has now tokenized £1.3 billion ($1.7bn), underlining its position as a driving force for securing mortgages using blockchain technology. As blockchain and digital currency technology become increasingly intertwined with fintech, Europe has an opportunity to use its leading position in the ecosystem to introduce cutting-edge financial tools and services to drive further growth throughout the ecosystem. This helps to ensure a pipeline for innovation, even as leading domestic players like Revolut and Wise remain attracted to the prospect of US listings. At a time when suspicions over the longevity of the AI boom are continually coming into question, Europe’s melting pot of innovative fintechs can be a major draw for investors who are seeking exposure to stocks with higher growth potential as AI investments receive mixed levels of sentiment. Given that fintech solutions are finding adoption in a more frictionless manner, it’s reasonable to expect European firms to achieve sustainable growth that can help them find profitability and scalability in the future. Whether the artificial intelligence boom is in a bubble or not, Wall Street investors can find plenty of opportunities throughout Europe’s melting pot of fintech innovators, and these tech firms could offer some resilience in the face of uncertainty in AI.

Airship AI’s (NASDAQ: AISP) Q4 stock price correction is not without cause, but it is overdone, setting up a buying opportunity for investors. The quality of the opportunity is highlighted by the insider activity, which was bullish in November. Two insiders, including director and CEO Victor Huang, bought shares late in the month, shortly after its Q3 earnings report triggered a sudden downdraft. The earnings report is a concern for this emerging tech stock. However, the miss is due to one-offs, including the impact of Trump’s administration change, downsizing government staff, and the government shutdown. The takeaway is that the shutdown compounded slowdowns in the approval and payment process, impacting AISP's business. The details that matter include the backlog, pipeline, and expected spending increases tied to the Big Beautiful Bill. It contains billions in funding for border security and other security and defense needs that Airship AI is positioned to meet. Insider purchases are significant because these executives did not need to buy shares to indicate their support. CEO Victor Huang is reported to own as much as 12% of the stock through personal and various family holdings, while total insider exposure ranges from 30% to 40%. The company has a $166 million pipeline connected to a single government client, expected to close in 18-24 months. This is projected to enable over 1000% revenue growth compared to the 2025 forecast. The sell-side activity, including short selling, analysts, and institutions, has this market set up for volatility. The analysts’ coverage is virtually nil, indicating no support from that vector: coverage by a half dozen analysts lapsed over the last year, and the most recent update isn’t good. Weiss Ratings pegged the stock as a Sell, although it did not provide a price target; this rating was still sufficient to exacerbate the Q4 downdraft, given the high short interest. Short interest is running near 20% as of mid-November and is likely to remain high until a potent catalyst emerges. When it does, it could trigger a short-squeeze. The good news is that institutions are buying. The ownership is still light at roughly 6% but it is rising, and buying activity is robust. The pace in 2025 is about $3 bought for each $1 sold and will likely remain favorable for the foreseeable future. Buyers include a wide range of institutions, including mutual fund and ETF managers such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and Russell Investments Group. Airship AI is included in several Russell indices, including the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000. While dilution played a role in AISP’s stock price headwind, the threat is diminished in December. The exercise of warrants after the quarter’s end raised approximately $9 million in capital, positioning the company well for the upcoming year. The resulting $15.5 million in cash on the balance sheet is sufficient for several years of operation at the Q3 cash burn rate, ample time to get it over the line to profitability. The bad news is that AISP’s share price is rangebound. That said, the Q4 sell-off put the market at the range bottom, and a rebound is already building. The insider buys triggered a positive market response, driving the price up by more than 15% the following week. Assuming the market picks up on the signal, AISP could continue rising in December. The risk is that short-sellers will continue to sell into the rallies, capping gains Thomas Hughes has been a contributing writer for InsiderTrades.com since 2019.

The production of green hydrogen, a technology based on the transformation of this element through electrolysis, is one of the keys. The IEA estimates that it would make it possible to save the 830 million tonnes of CO2 per year that originate when this gas is produced using fossil fuels. Our way of life needs an increasing amount of watts to function. The war in Ukraine has caused a global energy crisis due to the lack of fossil fuels. This has led to an unprecedented rise in the price of natural gas and coal, causing Europe to import much more liquefied natural gas than usual, with the attendant problem of worsening climate change. However, decarbonising the planet suggests a different world in 2050: one that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable, and driven by clean energies such as green hydrogen. Advantages And Disadvantages Of Green Hydrogen Market This energy source has pros and cons that we must be aware of. Let's go over some of its most important good points: However, green hydrogen also has negative aspects that should be borne in mind: Impact of green hydrogen Hydrogen as a fuel is a reality in countries like the United States, Russia, China, France and Germany. Others like Japan are going even further and aspire to become a hydrogen economy. Below we explain what the impact will be in the future: Electricity and drinking water generator : These two elements are obtained by reacting hydrogen and oxygen together in a fuel cell. This process has proved very useful on space missions, for example, by providing crews with water and electricity in a sustainable manner. Energy storage : Compressed hydrogen tanks are capable of storing energy for long periods of time and are also easier to handle than lithium-ion batteries because they are lighter. Transport and mobility : Hydrogen's great versatility allows it to be used in those consumption niches that are very difficult to decarbonise, such as heavy transport, aviation and maritime transport. There are already several projects under way in this area, such as Hycarus and Cryoplane, which are promoted by the European Union (EU) and aim to introduce it in passenger aircraft.

Governments accelerated hydrogen mobility through subsidies, fuel-cell vehicle incentives, and national hydrogen corridor projects, boosting large-scale adoption. Fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) offered longer driving ranges and faster refueling times, making them more suitable for commercial fleets. Rapid expansion of hydrogen refueling infrastructure, supported by public-private partnerships, further strengthened market leadership. The power generation is the second-largest segment, leading the market mainly because utilities increasingly turned to hydrogen as a long-term solution for clean, dispatchable energy. Growing concerns over grid stability and renewable intermittency pushed investment towards hydrogen-based power plants capable of storing excess solar and wind energy. Governments and energy regulators supported these projects through incentives for hydrogen-ready turbines and long-duration energy storage technologies. Distribution Channel Insights How Pipeline Segment Leads the Green Hydrogen Market? In 2025, the pipeline segment led the market because it offered the most efficient and cost-effective method for transporting hydrogen over long distances. Growing investments in repurposing existing natural gas pipelines enabled faster deployment and lower infrastructure costs compared to building new transport systems. Pipelines also supported large industrial clusters and hydrogen hubs that required constant, high-volume supply. Governments and energy agencies promoted pipeline networks to strengthen regional hydrogen economies and improve cross-border energy trade. The cargo segment is expected to grow fastest over the forecast period because hydrogen-powered fuel-cell systems proved especially suitable for heavy-duty freight operations that require long range and fast refueling. Logistics companies increasingly adopted hydrogen solutions to strict meter emissions regulations and sustainability mandates for fleet decarbonization. Hydrogen offers a clear advantage over batteries for long-haul cargo movement by minimizing downtime and supporting higher payload capacities. Source Insights The solar renewable energy sector dominates the green hydrogen space because it is an abundant resource in many parts of the world and is very beneficial when there is an abundance of sunlight. Countries such as India, Australia, and a few regions of Africa have established solar PV and solar thermal energy that can be used to run the electrolyzers that make hydrogen. Since hydrogen is converted from solar energy, solar also represents continuous and intermittent renewable power throughout the day hours which is an excellent way to reduce carbon emissions and associated costs. The large-scale projects being deployed in deserts around the world, components for hydrogen, also make intensive hydrogen solar power projects far more attractive in terms of the project. Global Green Hydrogen Market, By Source, 2022-2024 (USD Million) Wind energy plays a prominent role and is the fastest growing segment in the green hydrogen market due to the alignment of producing wind resources in windy places such as Europe and the coastal regions of water bodies. The wind turbines are also always working night and day, unlike solar. This represents a more stable hydrogen electrolyzer production. The Germany and UK governments have also advocated for wind-to-hydrogen projects to help reduce burdensome emissions developed from heavy industries. End User Insights The refining segment dominated the green hydrogen market with a revenue share of 41.85% in 2025. This is primarily because it is the world's largest consumer of hydrogen, using millions of tons annually for essential processes such as hydrocracking and hydrotreating to produce cleaner fuels. This massive, established demand provides an immediate, ready-made market for green hydrogen that other industrial or mobility applications currently lack. The existing infrastructure for hydrogen storage and pipelines makes integrating new, green hydrogen production facilities a more direct and feasible technical challenge than building new end-user supply chains from scratch, thereby solidifying its initial market dominance. Global Green Hydrogen Market, By End User, 2022-2024 (USD Million) The ammonia segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate over the projection period because it can be chemically converted into fertilizers and is easy to store and transport. It is also a clean-burning fuel, making it useful as a shipping fuel and a low-carbon option for power plants. Since many countries already have infrastructure for ammonia use, switching to ammonia made from green hydrogen is much simpler and faster. The iron & steel segment is expected to experience notable growth in the green hydrogen market, as this industry seeks to reduce carbon emissions. In the steel production process, hydrogen can replace steel, making it more environmentally friendly. In Europe, demand for cleaner steel to meet climate targets is driving the growth of new green hydrogen-based steel plants. ➤ Contact Us: sales@towardschemandmaterials.com | ☎ +1 804 441 9344 Regional Insights North America Green Hydrogen Market Trends The North American green hydrogen market is being driven by a confluence of factors that emphasize sustainability and innovation.

Title: Turkey Still Frozen? How AI Can Rescue Thanksgiving Disasters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/11/26/turkey-still-frozen-how-ai-can-rescue-thanksgiving-disasters/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:47:29Z
Full Content:
ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. Generative AI is quietly becoming a first responder for holiday chaos. Every year someone forgets to thaw the turkey. Or realizes they’re missing nutmeg. Or discovers the mashed potatoes have turned gummy 10 minutes before guests arrive. Thanksgiving disasters are a tradition as ingrained as the cranberry sauce. The difference in 2025 is that many households are turning to AI as an emergency hotline for everything from last-minute menu pivots to oven triage. A 2025 YouGov survey summarized by Brookings reports that 56% of U.S. adults have used AI tools and 28% use them weekly for day-to-day tasks. Consumer studies show that 61% of adults have used AI in the past six months, with nearly 1 in 5 relying on it daily. Families have started using these tools for the same everyday tasks that once fell to harried hosts, including cooking, grocery lists and budgeting. Food preparation is one of the fastest-growing use cases. Research on “AI in the kitchen” suggests about 64% of consumers have already tapped AI for recipe ideas, meal planning or kitchen troubleshooting, according to a study by AskAttest. Rising costs are accelerating the trend. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the average Thanksgiving dinner for 10 now sits around $55.18, down slightly from last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows year-over-year food-at-home prices up 2.7%, with meat and poultry costs rising even faster. Putting a holiday meal on the table now requires more planning, more math and more strategy. Overlay that with the chaos of hosting relatives, and the usual scatter-brained nature of planning complex multistep tasks in a compressed time environment, and it is no surprise that generative AI is emerging as a real-time rescue tool. Thanksgiving is more project management than cooking. It requires sequencing dozens of steps under time pressure while navigating unexpected problems. In past years, hosts turned to search engines, frantic group texts or a parent who “always knows what to do.” Search volume spikes each November for terms like “turkey won’t thaw,” “oven schedule Thanksgiving” and “how to fix lumpy gravy.” Today people are leaning on AI for rapid, contextualized judgment calls. AI tools are becoming the triage nurse for exactly these moments, stitching together advice, timelines, substitutions and rescue strategies in seconds. When using AI for Thanksgiving troubleshooting or disaster prevention, context matters even more than during calm planning. Start with a detailed briefing. A well-structured prompt can turn a looming disaster into a manageable adjustment. Here is a flexible prompt template you can use for this purpose: “You are my Thanksgiving kitchen triage assistant. Context: - Number of adults: - Number of kids: - Dietary needs or allergies: - Cooking skill level: - Available equipment (one oven, air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.): Current disaster or problem: [Describe the issue: turkey still frozen, missing an ingredient, side dish failed, running late] Constraints: - Time until guests arrive: - Budget flexibility: - Ingredients on hand: Goal: - Rescue plan with clear steps, backups and timing adjustments.” This level of detail lets AI deliver not just general advice but a survival plan tailored to your challenging kitchen needs. Even under normal conditions, AI can help you plan a menu with built-in safety nets. The trick is to design dishes that minimize points of failure. You can use AI to plan a menu based on risk tolerance. Tell AI if you have a tiny oven, no mixer or only one large pot. It will reshape the menu to avoid collisions that become disasters at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Likewise, if your table includes vegans, gluten-free diners and traditionalists, AI can help consolidate overlapping dishes so you avoid cooking three versions of everything. This reduces the odds of errors like cross-contamination or forgetting an essential side. For example: “Create a Thanksgiving menu for 10 that is low-risk and disaster-resistant. Requirements: - Only one oven. - Limited fridge space. - Beginner skill level. - Dishes should tolerate being made ahead, reheated or held warm.” AI will propose ideas with fewer temperature-sensitive steps, simpler techniques and more flexible ordering. A surprising number of Thanksgiving problems start at the store. Missing ingredients cause last-minute panic. Buying too much creates storage issues. Buying the wrong brand leads to consistency problems. And sometimes your most important ingredient is out of stock or unavailable. AI can step in here to help: “Turn these recipes into a consolidated shopping list. Group by store aisle. Flag ingredients that are easy to forget. Flag high-cost items where substitutions are possible. Identify items I should buy in duplicate to avoid emergencies. Help identify useful crisis prevention features such as: Highlight items prone to stockouts near the holiday and provide alternatives if they are not available Identify ingredients with large price swings Suggest pantry backups (like evaporated milk or broth) Build a 'Thanksgiving emergency kit’ of spices, foil, butter and broth” You can also ask AI to generate a cross-store comparison table so you can plug in prices from Aldi, Walmart, Costco or your local market. The LLMs themselves won’t have access to the most recent prices, however, so this will be a more challenging task. In the near future, expect the AI systems to have live connectors with current pricing so this should be a more trivial ask. The biggest disasters happen in the final three hours before the meal. AI thrives here. Make it your kitchen strategist, using this following prompt to help you get your act together: “You are my Thanksgiving day kitchen scheduler. Menu: [paste recipes] Dinner time: 5 p.m. Constraints: one oven, four burners, an air fryer. Tasks: 1) Build a timeline from 24 hrs before dinner to serving time. 2) Identify critical path steps. 3) Show when oven conflicts will occur and offer alternatives. 4) Suggest prep tasks that reduce chaos. Help me avoid the ‘everything needs 375 degrees F at once’ problem: Given these dishes and their preferred temperatures, create a single-oven plan that avoids temperature changes. Allow minor temperature compromises and note how they affect results.” If something goes wrong, AI can rescue you on the fly. Here are some AI quick-save prompt possibilities based on the disaster. Turkey still frozen at 10 a.m. (You know it needs to be thawed out well in advance, right?): “Act as a highly experienced home cook chef. Please help me with a critical problem I am facing.The turkey is still partially frozen. Dinner is in 6 hours. The turkey weighs 14 pounds. Give me safe, USDA-aligned rapid-thaw options and an adjusted cooking timeline.” Mashed potatoes too gluey? Try the following: “Help! You are my thanksgiving day triage assistant. My mashed potatoes turned gummy. Guests arrive in 30 minutes. Give me a fix using common ingredients.” Stuffing dried out? Try the following prompt: “Acting as a very experienced home cook chef capable of recovering any home cooking problem using commonly available ingredients and supplies.My stuffing is dry and crumbly. How can I rescue it without making it mushy?” AI cannot taste your food, but it can apply known kitchen chemistry and common approaches to rescue most dishes. Thanksgiving overspending is its own form of disaster. The PwC 2025 Holiday Outlook survey reports that about 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending over the next six months because of higher prices and a tougher economic outlook. The same PwC survey notes that 53% of consumers say price increases will likely affect their holiday spending decisions. AI supports budget recovery in several ways. First it can diagnose your menu’s cost centers by analyzing menus and ranking dishes by cost. AI can help suggest ways to reduce total cost by 20% without losing the holiday feel. It can also suggest alternatives for expensive items while maintaining flavor profiles. You still need to sanity-check allergy considerations, but it is a strong starting point. You can also use AI to build a budget strategy after something goes wrong. For example, if a dish burns or ingredients spoil, AI can propose fallback options that stay within your remaining budget. Post-Thanksgiving regret also often stems from having either way too many leftovers or not enough to make the weekend easy. AI can help build a leftovers plan that avoids both. For example, after providing some detail of your menu to an AI system, try the following prompt to help adjust cooking quantities: “Help me plan quantities for seven adults and three kids. We want leftovers for one additional meal only. Give recommended amounts for turkey, sides, and desserts.” Or you can use AI to creatively repurpose your cooking output. AI can reassign ingredients or repurpose partially saved dishes. “I burned half the stuffing. Here is what is left. Create a next-day meal plan using what survived.” Extra points if you provide a photo of the burned side and if AI can generate an image of what the rescued meal would look like. As we become more comfortable and familiar with AI, we all know that we can’t always trust AI outputs. AI can calm panic, but it also makes confident mistakes. Treat it like a smart assistant, not an authority. Always verify cooking temperatures. Use USDA guidelines to confirm poultry temps and resting times. Make sure to check allergy-related substitutions. AI can miss hidden allergens. Double-check any substitution involving nuts, dairy, gluten or soy. Be cautious with timing shortcuts. If a suggestion seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do not rely on AI to reduce safe cooking or cooling times. Just because the LLM confidently says something can be done on a specific time frame doesn’t mean it actually can. This is especially important for thawing, reheating and cooling food. When in doubt, consult USDA, FDA or your local extension office. AI has transitioned from a novelty to a true kitchen command center. It helps troubleshoot thawing issues, prevent oven collisions, salvage failed sides and can keep costs under control. Used well, it reduces stress and increases safety without replacing the heart of the holiday. So even if the turkey is still frozen on Thursday morning, the holiday can be saved, gracefully, safely and with your sanity intact.

Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:39:26Z

About us Copy link Tokenised money-market funds have ballooned to a $9 billion crypto market sector, but what looks like quiet progress has got the Bank for International Settlements sounding early risk warnings. Analysts at the Basel-based global forum of central banks and the Collegio Carlo Alberto, a research institute, said that, despite their digital packaging, these crypto funds remain exposed to traditional money-market tensions, according to a report published on Wednesday. Tokenised money-market funds are just like their traditional counterparts: they allow investors to earn yield on cash instruments directly on-chain. “Tokenised money-market funds give rise to risks that mirror and may even amplify those found in conventional money market funds and stablecoins,” the report stated. The analysts said decentralised finance integration may heighten market stresses through leverage and interconnected protocols, or what industry proponents call composability. Given the tight coupling between such funds and stablecoins, market shocks could spread more quickly and cause greater damage than in traditional markets. The warning comes as tokenised money-market funds surge alongside crypto’s broader expansion into real-world assets, a trend that even the BIS sees as a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the digital asset market. Tokenised money-market funds grew 265% in the last year, according to data from RWA.xyz. And the sector could grow to $250 billion in the next three years, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, predicted in October. Even as it sounded the alarm, the BIS said these crypto products may become a backbone of the global financial system, given their growth and rising institutional interest. Traditional finance juggernauts like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Swiss Bank UBS are some of the institutional players in the tokenised money market sector. But with this growth potential comes the need for proactive measures to curtail market risks before they harden into systemic threats that could upend both the crypto and traditional markets, the report stated.

Title: Grayscale files with SEC to list Zcash ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-sec-zcash-etf
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:25:44Z
Full Content:
The fund, which could be listed on NYSE Arca, would be the first ETF tied to a privacy coin, following several other listings from Grayscale and asset managers. Grayscale is aiming to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund in a move that could mark one of the first investment vehicles linked to a privacy coin. In a Wednesday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Grayscale submitted a Form S-3 registration statement, signaling its intention to convert its fund tied to Zcash (ZEC) into a spot ETF. The move followed Grayscale’s launch of other spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP (XRP). The simplified form with the regulator could allow Grayscale to list the Zcash ETF on the NYSE Arca. According to data from Nansen, the price of ZEC increased by more than 50% in the past 30 days and by 1,050% in the past 12 months, reaching $519.62 at the time of publication. Since the SEC initially approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, several asset management companies, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and others, have expanded their offerings to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale debuted the first spot DOGE ETF this week, which saw $1.4 million in volume on Monday. Related: NYSE approves Grayscale DOGE and XRP ETFs, clearing launch for Monday Earlier this month, Leap Therapeutics said it would use a $50 million investment from Winklevoss Capital, the venture capital firm founded by Gemini creators Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to acquire ZEC tokens as part of its cryptocurrency treasury strategy. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas later argued on social media that the privacy coin could essentially pull support away from Bitcoin, though many users were skeptical of his claims.

Title: These Fortune 500 companies are laying off thousands of workers and fueling economic anxiety
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/26/layoffs-economy-how-many-what-companies-fortune-500/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:17:13Z

It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

I'd definitely recommend Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) or Oakley Meta Vanguard, but if you're new to smart glasses, start on the first-gen ground floor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta wants to clear out stock of its first-generation Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off) and its more popular Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off). Meta glasses have never gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity. In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta just launched its Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison. Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes much more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years. or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329 $263.20 at Best Buy Android Central verdict: ★★★★ The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights. You get a natural fit that blends in with other sunglasses, letting you capture shots organically by tapping a button or ask the AI for insights, all with your phone in your pocket. Also at: Amazon | Meta If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. Gen 1, the difference isn't as stark as you'd assume. The photo resolution and FoV, storage space, IPX4 water resistance, mic and speaker quality, Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth connectivity, and apps are unchanged, while the weight is virtually the same. The new glasses do give you a video resolution boost from 1080p to 3K and a couple of extra hours of battery life. But is it worth spending an extra $150 or so for the 2nd-gen polarized glasses, just to get these two perks? Equally important, Meta has already brought its best second-generation features to its first-gen glasses, making them feel new. Vanguard glasses introduced Garmin integration in October, autocapturing videos at important race moments and reading out your health stats from your wrist; Meta brought this feature to Gen 1 glasses the next month. Likewise, Vanguard glasses added improved video stabilization algorithms to make in-motion sporty videos look smoother, and Meta brought the feature to first-gen glasses in November without telling anyone. Meta isn't interested in gatekeeping its features to make you upgrade, which means you can buy the last-gen Ray-Ban deal without any FOMO. The shorter battery life, you'll have to live with. But smart glasses fans lived with the 4-hour maximum for two years; you can too to get this Black Friday price! Or, if you can't, splurge on the full-price newer glasses without regrets!

Title: Coffee Break: Nvidia’s Narrative Breaking Down?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/11/nvidias-narrative-cramer-burry-alphabet-tpus-druckenmiller.html
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:49Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. As a horrible old Man who was licensed to run a collection agency for more than a decade ( I actually specialized in second and third placement debts, including corporate debt) I look at the Money flows. And while NVIDIA is not as blatant a scam as WeWork was, the financial relationships between NVIDIA and its “Customers” are Peculiar, to say the least. I’m reminded of Keyne’s saying that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, regarding the short sellers. Since Sam Altman’s ultimate contribution to society and business is going to be individualized sex porn, the only real question for the business world is, what is the monetary value as a percentage of GDP? I assume we can take OpenAI being worth $500B to some investors based on his penultimate contribution of individualized non-sex porn for all ChatGPT users’ needs for companionship and flattery as a starting point for computing the value of his ultimate contribution.

Title: Coffee Break: Nvidia’s Narrative Breaking Down?

Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:49Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much?

Title: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-100x-rally-to-225-why/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:39Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.

November 26, 2025 2:00pm by Barry Ritholtz It’s that time of year again when families gather to feast on bountiful harvests and to give thanks for all of our blessings. This year, skip the “Vibes” and instead focus on market data. Don’t lose sight of nuances and shades of grey; they don’t make for great memes, but they do lead to a better understanding of what’s going on. Here are ten nuanced, slightly contrarian ideas for you to chew over: 1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market higher for years to come. Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time. My favorite takes on AI have come from Derek Thompson and Timothy Lee, who looked into the 12 main arguments Pro & Con, and Benjamin Riley, who aims to “help people understand human cognition and artificial intelligence.” 2. INFLATION: Everything costs more this year — except for the Turkey. The largest fiscal stimulus since World War 2 led to the largest inflation surge since the 1970s. The rate of price increases rose by 9% (peaking June 2022) before falling back to 3% nearly as quickly. There were numerous causes of inflation, but the top of the list was the pandemic supply issues and the huge fiscal stimulus. People confuse the rate of price change with prices. We had high inflation; today, we have low(ish) inflation, but we still retain higher prices. Everything is much more expensive today, even with inflation way down. Low Inflation and High Prices are not mutually exclusive. CPI Inflation is in the 2-3% range today, but it is ticking upwards, creating difficulties for those on the FOMC who want to cut rates. 3. SUPPLY & DEMAND: We may not have structural inflation as we did in the 1970s, but we do have a structural imbalance in supply and demand of many critical goods and services. A few significant examples: Until supply catches up with demand, those prices will remain high. And that is before we get to health care and education costs. 4. ENERGY: The inflation of the 1970s was structural, caused in large part by the Arab Oil Embargo. In contrast, the United States is a net energy exporter today. In the 1970s, energy accounted for about 10% of the average household budget; the Chicago Fed found it peaked at nearly 14% in the early 1980s. Household energy costs are about half of those levels today (5-6%), even as energy consumption has increased significantly. Every power-hungry device, from automobiles to HVAC systems to appliances, is now many times more efficient than in the past. The wildcard is increased demand from power-hungry data centers… 5. CRYPTO CRASH: Given the embrace of crypto by the President (and POTUS’s family), much of Bitcoin 2025 gains can be attributed to this administration’s policies. We should not be surprised by the correlation between the President’s political fortunes / approval ratings, and the price of Bitcoin. The President has had a terrible month; from the election thumping to the fallout with MTG to losing multiple legal cases (Tariffs at SCOTUS, Comey / James case dismissals), it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has suffered a 30% crash this month as well: 6. TARIFFS: Are fascinating: They cause temporary inflation spikes and permanent higher prices. There is no getting around it – any additional tax on imported goods is a source of increased prices. And as we have seen before, even domestic producers will raise prices (Greedflation) if they believe consumers won’t balk. The good news: If the Supreme Court arguments were anything to go on, many of the Tariffs are likely to get struck down. 7. RATE CUTS: You can make a solid case either way – inflation remains stubborn at (or over) 3%, but there are signs of labor market softness, slowing consumer sales, and mediocre sentiment. Expectations had fallen to a ~20% chance of a rate cut – until yesterday’s poor data. Now, we are back to an 80% chance of a December cut. Beyond that is anyone’s guess… 8. BUBBLES: By definition, it takes a crowd to create a bubble. Can you recall the public, the media, or even the Fed identifying a bubble on a timely basis? (Me neither). Asked differently, can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational? If your answer is yes, then it’s likely not a bubble. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the AI bubble debate is Alphabet (GOOGL) passing Nvidia (NVDA) YTD returns: : 9. RECESSION: People hate inflation, but the alternative was a deep and long-lasting pandemic recession. We avoided a 10-12% unemployment rate, but the cost was 9% inflation. Consider the alternative, had both the Trump and Biden admins not cranked up the fiscal spend, people would have been furious at the failure to do anything1. It’s a Lose/Lose; whatever choice got made, half the population would have been furious. As angry as people are over high prices, they would have been even angrier at a do-nothing government letting an ugly recession take hold. 10. VALUATIONS: The Mag 7 remains pricey, even as Nvidia slides 13% off its highs. Its expensive, but it also generates $57 billion in quarterly revenues! Some sectors are extremely overpriced, others are more reasonable. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — is at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, but not ridiculous. Nuance is your friend. Safe travels!

Black Friday is bringing rare discounts across the board, including on one of our favorite sneaker brands: Hoka. Known for ultra-cushioned soles, lightweight builds, and that signature rocker shape that helps ease pressure on joints, you can always count on Hoka shoes to deliver top-notch support. But you can't always count on them to be affordable, which is why now's the time to snag a pair. During Hoka's Black Friday and Cyber Week sale, members can save 20% on the brand's entire collection (yes, you heard that right). If you're not a Hoka member, you can still score plenty of deals in the brand's sale section, including discounts on our top-tested styles like the Gaviota 5 and Bondi 9. We're noticing especially great markdowns on trail shoes like the Speedgoat 6, which come in handy on winter runs when the sidewalks turn icy. If you do want to become a member, though, signing up is free and easy, and will also earn you 10% off your first order (up to $60). Below, we've rounded up the best Hoka Black Friday deals, but be sure to grab them while they're still in stock. Also check out our full roundup of the best Black Friday deals and early Cyber Monday deals for more editor-vetted discounts across every category. I've tested dozens and dozens of Hoka styles over the years, and there really is a different pair for every person and every need. So, if you're shopping with comfort and support top of mind — whether for walking, standing all day, or running — be sure to browse my thoroughly tested guide to the best Hokas for help picking the right pair. For overpronators, this stability shoe is ultra-plush, ultra-breathable, and super lightweight. Hoka's cushy sneakers are well-loved by our reviewers, the Rincon 4 is the brand’s latest edition of one of our favorite cheap running shoes. The Hoka Bondi 9 are the brand’s most cushioned running shoes, built for runners prone to shin splints or knee pain, or anyone who’s on their feet all day. The Bondi 9s offer plush comfort without the bulk, with a roomy fit, soft Super Critical foam, and a breathable knit upper. The updated design of the 9s still feels stable and responsive, making it a solid choice for recovery runs or long shifts. These lightweight trail runners provide a comfortable and responsible ride with incredibly reliable traction to keep you moving fast through the mountains. For overpronators, this stability shoe is ultra-plush, ultra-breathable, and super lightweight. They're have extra arch support to keep your foot flat as it rolls through each step, which prevents collapsed arches in the long run. These lightweight walking shoes are completely waterproof and comfortable on uneven terrain. They also have ​​the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance. The Clifton 9 hits the sweet spot of everything Hoka is known (and loved) for — meta rocker, cushy midsole — without isolating anyone. These running sneakers have highly cushioned midsoles and a meta rocker to propel your gait forward. This running sneaker features a breathable upper and springy foam midsoles, with an aerodynamic shape built for speed. Most definitely — Hoka's don't go on sale that often (the brand isn't even hosting their own Black Friday deals event this year). The comfort and support of Hokas are well worth the price — but they're even more worth it if you score a pair at discount. It really depends on your running style and preferences. The Clifton 10s are an all-around crowd pleaser and hit the sweet spot of being cushy but still springy and responsive. The Bondi 9s are a high-cushion running shoe and feel plush on long-miles while still being lightweight and not too muddy. The Gaviota 5 are a great option for anyone with wide feet or anyone planning to walk for miles and miles, while the Speedgoat 6 are our go-to shoe for trail running. Across the board, Hokas are some of the best shoes for plantar fasciitis because they offer arch support, motion control, and shock absorption — especially for people who overpronate. The Gaviota 5 are ideal for support while walking, with their generous cushion, stability design, and built-in arch support. Folks with PF should also wear shoes at all times, including around the house; for this, we love the Ora Recovery Slides which feel like walking on clouds with top-notch arch support.

Title: Paying To Observe It All: Palo Alto Networks Acquisition Of Chronosphere
URL: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/paying-to-observe-it-all-palo-alto-networks-acquisition-of-chronosphere/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T17:59:56Z
Full Content:
Carlos Casanova, Principal Analyst Allie Mellen, Principal Analyst Carlos Rivera, Senior Analyst Joseph Blankenship, VP, Research Director Cybersecurity behemoth Palo Alto Networks (PANW) recently announced the acquisition of observability vendor Chronosphere for $3.35 billion. The acquisition is a departure from PANW’s security pure-play roots, as it will now also sell into technology buyers. This blog explores the reasons behind the acquisition and what it means for PANW and Chronosphere customers going forward. This acquisition has parallel purposes. First and most topically, it provides PANW with visibility as AI systems proliferate. Security vendors can’t secure AI agents if they can’t see what they are doing. Chronosphere provides PANW a data visibility pipeline to feed its XSIAM (extended security intelligence and automation management) solution and future AI detection engines. Chronosphere’s real-time telemetry and data visibility pipelines help PANW move its security platform, Cortex, one step closer toward additional visibility. If PANW successfully integrates CyberArk’s deep identity governance alongside Chronosphere’s observability data, it will have built up foundational capabilities for the discovery, governance, and security of AI agents and agentic AI workflows. As the risks escalate around an expanding attack surface driven by privileged AI workloads, this unification for visibility and control will be vital for closing a significant gap in the security stack for nonhuman entities. Second, as PANW moved into the security imformation and event management (SIEM) market, it recognized the overlapping use cases that many SIEM vendors address: security and observability. Think of vendors such as Splunk, Sumo Logic, Elastic, and CrowdStrike, which have solutions for both use cases. Many Forrester clients use their SIEM vendor for security and observability, thereby reducing vendor sprawl and centralizing data collection and storage. Security observability and operational observability have underpinning similarities in their data pipelines. Some enterprises, especially financial services, value the crossover. Prior to this acquisition, PANW had limited answers to the observability question, but now it has an opportunity to extend its capabilities into the adjacent observability market. This is more than just another headline. It’s a clear signal that traditional buying pattens and personas are under pressure. IT and security leaders are being challenged with platform strategies that dominate and as vendor trust becomes a critical differentiator. A buyer’s journey is often a process of confirmation, not selection. Consumers and stakeholders must: Forrester clients who want to continue this discussion or dive into Forrester’s wide range of AI, observability, and security research can set up a guidance session or inquiry with us. Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs. Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.

Title: UK budget: financial services sector reaction

Time Published: 2025-11-26T17:56:08Z

It is, says the government, a budget to support working households and UK businesses. Critics will argue that it represents a £26bn rise in taxes and more election promises broken. As much of the budget had been leaked, industry commentators did at least have time to prepare their ‘instant response’ comments well in advance. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Comments, below, from 80 industry observers range from the improbably positive to what to some may appear to represent exaggerated outrage. In the first camp for example, James Neville, CEO of Yaspa, asserts: “Today’s Budget sends a clear and important message to the UK’s entrepreneurs like myself. The government is signalling loud and clear that if you build here, Britain will back you.” On the other hand, Nimesh Shah, CEO of Blick Rothenberg summarises the measures as “the most damaging Budget in living memory”. He has an ally in the always quotable Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group. Always good for a soundbite, Green dismisses the budget as “a masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing.” Special mention is owed to Hal Cook of Hargreaves Lansdown, for a succinct summary of why gilts really do matter. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Comments published here are ordered by alphabetical order of the firm responding to the budget. We are happy to hear that there will be an expansion of entrepreneurial investment schemes and a consultation on how to attract more entrepreneurs. The UK still has everything it needs to lead the next wave of global innovation: world-class talent, deep capital markets, and a thriving engineering community. What we’ve lacked is momentum and belief. This Budget was an opportunity to change the narrative, to give founders a reason to build here, scale here, and stay here. If we create the right environment for ambitious entrepreneurs to experiment and grow, the UK can reclaim its position as the best place in the world to build transformative technology. It starts with backing the builders. We look forward to the future, with an optimistic belief in the potential of building in Britain. The government could go further here, tactically focusing on industries set to dominate growth in the 21st Century like AI, FinTech and Bitcoin. There is precedent for such tactical decision-making, evidenced in how UK government support for the video games and film industries has unlocked growth and employment in both sectors. Mansion tax The Mansion Tax announced in today’s Budget will likely soften demand for higher-end homes, especially those near the £2m threshold where the impact is greatest. While the super-prime market may absorb the charge, the wider upper tier can expect renewed price pressure and slower growth. We may see a brief pre-implementation rush, but just as many owners could delay selling to avoid the levy, reducing turnover and constraining supply. The burden will fall hardest on asset-rich, cash-poor households in high-value areas such as London. “It is disappointing that stamp duty reform was overlooked. As one of the biggest barriers to market mobility, leaving it untouched will continue to create friction in an already subdued market. The OBR’s downgraded growth forecasts, as a result of the budget, prove that supporting transactions should have been central to today’s package. Infrastructure and investor sentiment On a more positive note, renewed funding for the Lower Thames Crossing signals intent to push ahead with major infrastructure. Such projects typically bolster confidence among developers, investors and buyers. Over time, improved connectivity should lift demand, and eventually values, across parts of east and south-east London. Capital flows and residential investment Rather than driving capital out, the Budget is more likely to redirect it within UK housing. Foreign, institutional and private-credit investors are expected to continue favouring mid-market, income-led residential assets, build-to-rent, PBSA, single-family rental, affordable and suburban schemes, while relying more heavily on credit strategies as banks remain cautious. ISA allowance reduction The cut to ISA allowances is another unwelcome development. Cash ISAs are central to how aspiring buyers save, and a lower limit makes deposit-building even harder. It may also reduce low-cost funding for building societies and smaller lenders, tightening mortgage availability. At a time when the market needs more mobility and higher transaction volumes, this risks suppressing demand, delaying first-time buyer activity and adding friction to an already subdued market. What treasurers and their businesses say they need from government is clarity, certainty, and consistency – particularly in fiscal policy, regulation and access to capital. These preconditions are essential for long-term investment, effective risk management and confident participation in UK financial markets. In last year’s Budget, business confidence was shaken by the stark disconnect between the Government’s positive prior rhetoric and the actuality of the Chancellor’s decision to increase Employer National Insurance Contributions. So, a repeat shock to business this year would have been very damaging. The Chancellor has largely avoided springing major surprises on businesses this year. It will take time to see whether the impact of extending the freeze on personal income tax thresholds and introducing some new taxes on property and salary sacrifice pension contributions (from 2029) will ultimately dent consumer confidence, and by extension impact the business sector in the medium term. Budget lets down SMEs Today’s silence on specific SME support is hugely disappointing. With 44% of SMEs having delayed investment decisions until after the Budget, the absence of meaningful and targeted measures today will further hold back capital expenditure. This Budget offered little to ease the pressures SMEs are facing day in, day out. Inflation and rising operating costs remain the most pressing challenge for two-thirds of SMEs, and without intervention to ease this burden, the Government risks stalling their ability to invest in jobs, innovation, and growth. SMEs are the beating heart of the UK economy, and today they needed a signal of confidence. Instead, while this Budget stopped short of harming SMEs, it also stopped short of helping them. For a Government that promised to champion small business growth in its Plan for Change, this is a missed opportunity. This is the most damaging Budget in living memory Even before Rachel Reeves stood up to deliver her Budget 2025 speech, this is one of the most damaging Budget statements in living memory and will leave a lasting impact for a generation. The 2% increase to dividend tax rates, property and savings (raising over £2bn) presumably breaks Labour’s manifesto pledge not to increase Income Tax. The reduction in the cash ISA limit to £12,000 will cost a higher rate taxpayer over £140 in income tax (assuming interest rate of 4.5% and no personal savings allowance). The ISA regime has just been made (even more) unnecessarily complicated by having a different regime for over-65s. I understand the logic but this is making a mess of ISAs. The changes to salary sacrifice pensions from 2029 are another damaging blow to business after last year’s employer’s NIC increase. This will be inflationary and lead to further job losses. It was a certainty that personal tax allowances and thresholds would be frozen in today’s Budget. I wasn’t expecting it would be for another 3 years and would drag almost 1 million people into higher rate (40%) tax. Changes to dividends, property income and savings introduces new rates into the personal tax system which add further complexity into the already complicated regime. The real impact of frozen tax allowances and thresholds. Someone earning £20k is almost £600 worse-off today; they will be over £1,000 worse-off in 2031. The personal allowance will be frozen at £12,570 until 2031. Had it increased with inflation, it should today be worth nearly £16k; and it should be worth closer to £18k. This is a significant tax increase on ‘working people’ on lower incomes. A Budget for the Labour Party – not the economy, not business, not working people The effect of frozen personal tax allowances and thresholds is severe for middle earners and has been a feature since 2010 when the higher rate band was £43,875; today it is £50,270 when it should be almost £68,500 had it increased with inflation. Was that Rachel Reeve’s last Budget? If it was, she’s had her thunder truly stolen by the OBR with their inexcusable early release of the Budget. The chaos was summed up by the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing the forecasts before the speech and leaking the entirety of the Budget before Reeves said a word. This is the perfect ‘tax and spend’ Budget from the Labour government, and today’s tax policies will leave a devastating impact on the economy for years to come. It is a Budget for the Labour Party – not the economy, not business and definitely not working people. In the hospitality sector, many smaller companies are on the brink of collapse The Budget was, again, silent on major changes to the corporation tax regime. A relief for many but another opportunity missed by the Chancellor to reduce the tax burden for SMEs particular after the rise in employers NIC in April. In the hospitality sector, many smaller companies are on the brink of collapse, and while the reduction in business rates is welcome, if not a little late, business owners with significant sums of money at risk understandingly expect the Government to do more. The latest OBR data highlights a disappointing lack of targeted support for the UK financial services sector. Despite the sector’s critical role in driving growth and innovation, the Budget missed several key opportunities: These omissions raise questions about the UK’s long-term strategy for financial services and its ability to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and globalized market. The taxing of Electric Vehicles per mile is presumably on mileage driven in the UK. The difficulty will be working out how they are going to measure the mileage since not all mileage on the odometer is necessarily in the UK. However, there is some sense in such a tax – EVs are generally heavier than petrol/diesel cars and do more road damage. Increase of minimum wage can accelerate that businesses are more shifting to AI? Gilt market shows positive impact so far but its seems a bit swinging which reflect government inconsistent directions. Salary sacrifice being brought into NIC unlikely to change taxpayer behaviour much as they won’t really notice the difference (assuming the net amount put into the pension pot) but employers will feel the pinch. Another incentive to turn to AI as quickly as possible to reduce the workforce. A problem that the Government doesn’t seem to think is coming with their forecasts for unemployment reducing to 4.1% by 2030. However, a number of these measures are deferred therefore not immediate in one way is a bit of a relief but we will have a general depression around long term investment and gloom now with every year deferred pain appearing – it is like waiting for a painful operation on a long term NHS waiting list. I am not sure the Class 2 top up scheme for pensions was a “Tory policy” – too much blame when it is not due- this is just how pensions work and was simply clarified. Freezing thresholds will actually be an accounting entry and only affect the future, but pensioner relief is welcome. On Landlords it is completely false as they are limited on debt reduction to 50% – the cliff edge will mean many more landlords will reduce stock so rents will significantly increase. She also completely brushed over the increase on people who save – why save anymore? The principle is not the same. The widely-speculated cap on salary sacrifice contributions to workplace pension schemes at £2,000 has been confirmed – but with implementation delayed until April 2029. It is predicted to raise £4.7bn in the first year of implementation. This would protect value for lower earners but for someone earning say £60,000 a year and contributing 5% via salary sacrifice, it will cost them an additional £20 a year. This might not sound like much, but it will cost the employer an additional £150 a year. I expect to see employers reining in the generosity of their contributions – for example curbing additional matched contributions for those using salary sacrifice – and a wider effect on salary increases and bonus payments in general, which is not good news for workers and growth in the economy overall. It will have a material effect on UK retirement readiness Unlike previous budgets there is no targeted support for arts, media or culture – despite the promised “commitment” to the creative industry. The proposed increase in taxes to dividend, property income and savings, directly reduce the net earnings of freelancers, incorporated creatives and content creators who rely on such investment income between projects. Where freelancers use salary sacrifice pension schemes they too will lose National Insurance exemptions on contributions above £2,000 per annum, diminishing previously essential long tern savings advantages. The budget makes it a tough operating environment for independent artists and freelancers, it is disappointing that these individuals have not been considered. The creative industry needs more support, not tougher sanctions. US/UK Tax The increase in UK tax on property income creates another large gap between the US & UK taxation of property due to difference in US depreciation deduction and creating more excess foreign tax credits. Planning will be needed around how long to hold these properties in order to maximise the use of the Foreign Tax Credits. The UK is become a more expensive location for Americans to continue to live. The decision to have Alan Milburn review the causes for ‘rising youth economic inactivity’ seems to be unnecessary. The reality is that many commentators would just highlight that the consistently high increases in the national minimum wage – particularly the wage which applies for the under 21s – together with the increase in employer NICs mean that it is inevitable that employers are considering whether to employee someone – especially someone with no work experience – more and more closely. Rachel Reeves missed an opportunity to highlight the recently confirmed £55bn of long-term Research and Development (R&D) funding available to maintain the UK as the leading partner of choice to international investors. The economic benefits have been proven: innovation and job creation facilitated by UK’s vast diverse highly skilled talent-pool across universities and research facilities. IPT tax take downgraded but Chancellor misses opportunity to support workforce health and productivity While the OBR has nudged down its forecast for Insurance Premium Tax receipts, this doesn’t change the bigger picture. The Chancellor has overlooked a clear opportunity to support the recommendations of the Keep Britain Working review, by encouraging take up of private health insurance products through reducing or removing Insurance Premium Tax for employers and individuals. Private health services play an important role in prevention and early treatment of conditions which affect individuals’ ability to work. The refusal to lower or eliminate extra taxes on the products is at odds with the Chancellor’s mission to lower NHS waiting lists, encourage the productivity of the workforce and boost economic growth. Rachel Reeves’ 2025 Budget has so far centred on a strategy of plugging the fiscal gap through significant tax increases while simultaneously committing to long-term public investment. A key feature is the freezing of personal income-tax thresholds for another three years, a move that effectively raises taxes over time as wage growth pulls more people into higher bands. Additional revenue-raising measures target dividends, high-value property, gambling, and other sectors, while spending plans emphasise investment in health, education, infrastructure, defence and technology. This mix of higher taxes and expanded public investment has created a mixed response in financial markets: gilts have risen, pushing yields lower, and the pound has strengthened against its major peers in a sign that investor concerns about fiscal credibility may have been tempered slightly. The FTSE 100 remains stable within the wider uptrend that has taken over global equities in the last few days. That said, sentiment is fragile, with investors weighing the risk that back-loaded tax revenue, elevated borrowing costs, and uncertain growth prospects could make the fiscal plan difficult to sustain. While certain sectors poised to benefit from planned public investment have reacted more positively, overall market behaviour reflects caution and a focus on the government’s ability to deliver credible long-term fiscal discipline. The Autumn 2025 Budget tightens the tax landscape for investors and entrepreneurs. Cuts to capital gains relief on EOT transactions, higher dividend tax rates and a three-year extension of frozen income tax thresholds could raise the cost of exits and profit extraction, prompting many to revisit succession plans, remuneration strategies and deal timelines. Additionally, higher dividend rates and prolonged fiscal drag also mean more owner-managers and investors will be pulled into higher tax bands, making it vital to reassess the balance of salary, dividends, pensions and capital returns. Reduced CGT relief on EOT transactions is the most immediate shift, with sellers now facing a material CGT charge that may affect pricing and funding structures. We can expect EOT transaction activity to decrease, at least initially, whilst shareholders consider if the EOT structure is truly right for their business. The Chancellor also launched a call for evidence on improving the UK’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. Engagement will be key to ensuring new measures reflect practical realities for founders and growth companies. Uncertainty is never good for banking, and the endless speculation about today’s Budget has already tested confidence across the sector. Households and businesses alike have struggled to best prepare for these measures blindfolded, but now that we know, the task is to steady the ship, rebuild momentum, and focus on making the most of the months ahead.The decision not to increase levies or add new regulatory burdens on banks was welcome, given the strong contribution our sector already makes through the taxes we pay. We have a critical role to play in supporting growth for businesses and ensuring stability for households, and today’s budget will not hold us back from that goal.A healthy and competitive banking market delivers better outcomes for customers, so we must hope that the measures announced today allow newer players to grow and innovate to keep the banking space diverse and competitive. It will be the tenants as well as landlords who pay the price for the Chancellor’s move to increase Property Income Tax by 2% by April 2027. Landlords have become an easy political target and now they will be faced with an additional 2% on basic, higher and additional rates, taking these rates to 22%, 42% and 47% respectively. For nearly a decade, property investors have operated with little to no profit surplus. Raising taxes on rental income, especially when coupled with the upcoming Renters’ Rights Bill reforms, will inevitably result in higher rents. That’s just basic economics, and it will be the tenants who pay the price. An investment must make sense financially, and when costs rise, so do rents unless tenants simply cannot afford them. In those cases, landlords will be forced to sell. This won’t necessarily help renters onto the property ladder though, as demand for housing remains strong and prices are unlikely to fall meaningfully. Instead, we’ll see more properties acquired by large corporate landlords, who tend to prioritise shareholder value over tenant wellbeing. The Government is particularly targeting the ‘accidental’ landlords who aren’t operating like a large corporation but who are adding value to the economy by investing money into refreshing old properties or creating new homes by converting the lower-demand large properties into share living. The relationship between landlords and tenants is too often considered by the government as hostile, rather than as what it should be, a valued relationship between service-provider and customer. HMOs (House in Multiple Occupation) will be hit the hardest. These landlords tend to generate higher rental income per property of around 12%-18% ROI with typical six-bed homes, compared to standard 3%-6% ROI on a two-bed buy-to-let investors. HMOs will therefore shoulder a particularly large share of the 2% property tax hikes. These landlords house those on lower income, and those who most value connection with others. Whilst landlords can’t raise the rent much whilst occupied, as tenants leave, landlords will reset rents to market rates, and as unprofitable properties exit the market, demand for those that remain will intensify. This will disproportionately affect professional tenants, both in single lets and HMOs, with HMOs reacting faster due to shorter tenancy cycles. Longer-term, we may see more properties shift towards social housing, where government rents often exceed market rates, further squeezing those seeking affordable, high-quality homes. However, people often rent out of choice or because they can’t afford a deposit on a mortgage. Unlike home ownership, renting supports mobility, lets people move quickly for work, removes the burden of major upkeep, and, in shared living, gives people the connection and support that comes from living with others. But undermining landlords’ viability risks reducing choice and flexibility for renters. The sector needs predictability and incentives to invest in better homes, not policies that drive out those committed to quality and community. Instead of adding NI to rental income, the Government should focus on measures, such encouraging councils to approve more high-quality shared living and rental homes. There should be incentives to home creation, such as for converting a six- bed property, which is lower in demand, into six single bed properties, which are higher in demand. Easing the stamp duty surcharge on second homes, reviewing mortgage interest rules, and dropping NI proposals would reduce costs and encourage investment in upgrading ageing stock. Treating secure, affordable rental housing as essential economic infrastructure, rather than a secondary concern, is the only way to restore balance and stability for millions who rely on the private rented sector. Rachel Reeves’ 2025 Budget marks a turning point for the UK economy. By increasing taxes on wealth and assets under the banner of “taxing those with the broadest shoulders,” the Chancellor is signalling that Britain’s growth model – historically driven by domestic consumption, inward investment, and London’s role as a magnet for global wealth – is shifting and so too must the mindset of British merchants. As higher earners and investors look abroad for more favourable tax environments, the ripple effect will reach far beyond London’s elite. Local businesses that once thrived on domestic spending are already feeling the chill, from luxury retailers to service providers. For many, looking overseas is no longer just an opportunity, it’s a survival strategy. This exodus of wealth and spending power will reshape how British merchants think about growth. Expanding into international markets will become essential, not optional. That means getting serious about cross-border payments, ensuring they can move money efficiently, manage currency risk, and offer customers seamless payment experiences wherever they are in the world. In this new landscape, the ability to trade globally and get paid globally, will define the next generation of successful British businesses.” Rachel Reeves’ Budget may have been framed as a necessary step to restore fiscal stability, but the scale of the tax hikes risks alienating investment in one of Britain’s most dynamic sectors, technology. The UK’s tech ecosystem has long relied on a delicate balance of entrepreneurial confidence, international capital, and a supportive policy environment. This Budget shifts that balance. Raising taxes on capital, wealth, and assets sends a difficult signal to venture investors and founders alike, particularly those who have the option to relocate their capital, teams, or headquarters abroad. At a time when countries across Europe are actively competing to attract high-growth technology businesses, the UK cannot afford to make itself less appealing to the innovators driving economic productivity. The danger is that we create a two-speed economy: one where ideas are born in Britain but scaled elsewhere. For payments and fintech firms, this is particularly concerning, innovation thrives on cross-border collaboration, fluid capital movement, and investor confidence. If investment begins to flow out of the UK, the long-term cost won’t just be lost tax revenue, but diminished global influence in emerging fields such as AI, digital infrastructure, and financial technology. In an era defined by digital trade, Britain’s growth story depends not on taxing innovation, but on enabling it to move and scale globally. A commitment not to raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT offers households some reassurance at a time when many feel they have already reached the limits of what they can absorb. Even without tax rises, elevated prices for essentials continue to erode real disposable income. Our research makes clear that millions remain financially exposed, with a large proportion unable to handle even modest unexpected costs without borrowing. Tax stability helps, but many families will still feel day-to-day pressure from high rents, energy bills and food prices. However, the extension of the income tax threshold freeze will mean that, as wages rise, more people are dragged into higher tax brackets, effectively reducing their real income. While this measure boosts Government revenue, it comes at a cost to working households whose pay packets are already stretched thin. Combined with rising prices for essentials, this will leave millions feeling worse off, even if their nominal income increases. Any fiscal plan aimed at supporting working families needs to take into account the cumulative impact of tax freezes, rising living costs, and slow wage growth. Without that, disposable incomes will continue to shrink. For meaningful relief, the focus now needs to be on tackling structural cost pressures and improving access to affordable, responsible credit for those who need it. I really want to be able to offer a contrarian take on the budget, to be able to say that if you read between the lines then actually the consensus is wrong and that things are looking up. Unfortunately, what we got in Parliament, while not nearly as bad as it could have been, was more of the same. There were a lot of small tweaks that might help some people or some companies, but which collectively won’t turn Britain back into an economic powerhouse.At DECTA, we saw in our survey of British consumers that confidence is down across the board, especially when it comes to confidence in British small businesses. This is understandable: ordinary people feel overstretched, they know that they can’t spend as much at any company, big or small, and therefore they know that those companies must be doing worse than they had previously. Consumers won’t spend where they are not confident, which will only make things worse for small businesses that lack the resource to compete with larger, established brands. The budget, with its functional increase in income tax rates and other austerity-lite measures, does not seem like it will turn anything around, so confidence will remain low and businesses will take few risks – except perhaps to head outside of the country for growth.We can see this short-sightedness in the way that the budget treated the gaming industry. While it creates a much higher social cost than many sectors, gaming and gambling is a £16.1bn industry employing 75,000 to 90,800 people, and the UK Gambling Commission has spent years developing a regulatory framework that makes online gambling safer for consumers. The budget raises taxes on that industry from 21% to 40%, and that’s going to harm, not help: less revenue means less to invest in safety measures and anti-fraud technology and may push gambling operators away from the UK and into jurisdictions providing less regulation and support for consumers. That is to nobody’s benefit.I and many others have said this at every budget, but it bears repeating: Britain needs systemic change in order to become the economic power that it should be. The big surprise is that despite lower productivity growth, the Chancellor has been able to build in a bigger-than-expected margin of error into public finances. Faster wage growth has come to the Chancellor’s rescue, boosting tax receipts and enabling fiscal targets to be met. “Budget measures will help bolster growth and dampen inflation in the short term. However, today’s announcements will likely have a longer-term impact on growth, as the Chancellor is raising an extra £26bn a year in tax. The Chancellor confirmed today that the national insurance (NIC) relief for employees and employers on contributions paid by way of salary sacrifice will be limited to the first £2,000 from the 2029/30 tax year. Currently, salary sacrifice can save employees 8% or 2% in NIC on the amounts that they contribute, whilst employers save 15% on the same amount. If an employee earning £50,000 sacrifices 10% of their salary, their income tax and NIC is currently calculated based on the reduced salary of £45,000. The proposals will cause the employee’s NIC deductions in their payslips for 2029/30 to increase by £240 over the course of the tax year. The employer’s NIC will increase by £450. While not directly paid by the employee, some schemes currently pass on part of the employer’s NIC savings to employees through a top-up in employer contributions. The erosion of these savings could lead to employers reviewing their pension arrangements, possibly leading to lower overall contributions being made to the employee’s scheme. The changes do not affect the income tax relief on salary sacrifice contributions. Like other types of pension contributions, these will continue to provide income tax relief at the individual’s marginal tax rate. This can include reducing the amount of high-income child benefit charge or keeping taxable income below £100,000 to prevent the loss of the personal allowance or tax-free childcare. The new Stamp Duty relief is positive for IPOs in the UK. From tomorrow, it will reduce the cost of trading shares during the three years after an IPO is launched. Capital markets leaders in the UK have long called for the abolition of Stamp Duty on share trading, so this news will be received positively by the City. This was a big, broad budget raising £26bn in taxes, with the burden resting more on individuals than businesses. The freezing of income tax and NIC thresholds went beyond what was trailed, extending into the next Parliament and is expected to raise £7.8bn in 2029-30. The 88 measures announced today undoubtedly add to the complexity of the tax system; there was little simplification, except the abolishment of one duty. That said, many of the tax rises are being phased in gradually, which gives time to prepare and adapt. There is a positive message around growth if you consider the life cycle of business – there were improvements to the Enterprise Management Incentives at start up, through to the relief from Stamp Duty on newly listed shares. Of note was the pioneering approach to road pricing, building resilience into the tax system for the future. There is a continued focus on closing the tax gap, with further actions announced – including a whistleblower scheme to improve the way the tax system is administered – set to bring in a massive £10bn per year by the end of the parliament. A masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing When you raise the cost of holding income-producing investments, people will of course reconsider how and where they invest. You end up penalising patient capital and rewarding cash withdrawal. This is the opposite of building a thriving stock market. The government says it wants to rebuild the pension and savings culture, yet it imposes fresh barriers on anyone who actually saves or invests. That sends a simple message that locked-up capital is subject to stealth extraction. Why would someone tie money into UK equities under those rules when other markets reward income rather than punish it? Many savers already face low real interest rates. With interest income now facing heavier taxation, returns after tax may be negligible or negative. For retirees or those relying on interest to preserve capital, this compounds the squeeze. When saving becomes unprofitable, people look elsewhere — and often overseas. If you weaken incentives to save, invest and own property, you drain the lifeblood of wealth creation. You don’t just discourage new money. You encourage old money to move elsewhere When you make saving, investing and owning property more expensive, you don’t build prosperity. You drive it away. History will teach us that Reeves’ second – and critical – Budget was a masterclass in disincentivising saving and investing. The Chancellor has added 2% tax to dividend and savings income, making it 2% higher than equivalent income tax on employment income. However, it must be borne in mind that you don’t pay national insurance on dividend or savings income, whereas you do on employment income. There are already a number of tax reliefs available on dividend and savings income, some which only benefit lower earners. Interest and dividend income within a tax wrapper such as an ISA is tax free. This benefits high and low earners alike. If your total income not including dividend and interest income is less than £17,570 pa (excluding ISAs), you are allowed to receive the first £5,000 of interest income tax free. This benefits lower earners. Today was a missed opportunity for the Chancellor to introduce a first-of-its-kind ‘AI income tax’ that would shift the burden from hard working people onto the bots taking their jobs. Instead, the Budget relied on old fashioned levies, leaving everyday taxpayers to shoulder the cost while AI firms continue to benefit from lighter tax treatment. With the National Living Wage rising, this was also the ideal moment to introduce a minimum wage for robot labour. The UK introduced the minimum wage in the late 1990s to ensure a fair labour market at a time when free movement across the EU was reshaping the workforce. It prevented ‘cheap’ human labour from the continent from undercutting British workers. Today, we face a similar challenge – but this time from software. If we don’t extend minimum wage principles and tax rules to automated labour, we risk creating distortions far more serious than anything the single market produced. The bottom line is that a 21st century economy needs 21st century labour and tax rules, not regulations built for a world that no longer exists. It’s disappointing to see the government not taking a harder line on tackling cyberattacks, fraud and mobile phone theft, which should be top of the agenda. With more investment and resource allocation to tackling these issues, the government could have improved insurers loss-rations and kept premiums and costs stable for both businesses and consumers. The Chancellor’s decision to reduce the annual allowance in Cash ISAs from £20,000 to £12,000 for under 65s has been prompted, at least in part, by a desire to encourage greater flows of investment from cash into higher-growth investments like stocks and shares to ultimately boost the UK stock market and economy and drive greater returns for savers. This will likely bring a mixed reaction from individuals and businesses. While promoting informed investment decisions and supporting UK businesses is a plus, a consumer shift into stock market investment is certainly not automatic. Demand for cash ISAs has been rising, as more risk-averse savers and those with short-term plans for their savings, for example for property, often see them as a safe home for their money. These individuals may not want to switch a sizeable portion of their funds into stock market shares. Ultimately, this move could result in people saving less. Equally, for banks who leverage cash ISAs as funds for household and business loans, this decision could create challenges, potentially leading to higher interest rates, stricter lending criteria and reduced access to capital for firms. One of the Budget’s largest revenue-raising business measures is the reduction in the capital allowances rate on plant and machinery, forecast to generate £7bn in cash flow over the next five years. Whilst most new assets benefit from generous 100% full expensing allowances, this new measure erodes the tax relief available for older assets and second-hand purchases, which are specifically excluded. Limiting incentives to new assets restricts the relevance for second hand transactional markets such as infrastructure and real estate and doesn’t reflect the desire to reuse and recycle. The new 14% rate means it will now take over 16 years before the asset is fully written off. The announcement on e-invoicing in today’s Budget, requiring all VAT invoices to be issued in a specified electronic format from April 2029, is a significant step forward and provides certainty for businesses in terms of timeframe. It also aligns the UK with a number of other markets across Europe who are going live with e-invoicing legislation in 2026. The Government has explicitly recognised the important role e-invoicing will play in supporting HMRC’s digitalisation goals over the coming years, as well as its ability to reduce the VAT gap. The announcement follows an initial consultation earlier this year and shows that HMRC is continuing to see the progress and benefits of e-invoicing in other major economic markets. Whilst not meeting Malaysia’s implementation record of two years, HMRC’s timelines align to those of other major markets who typically move from initial consultation to formal legislation in between three and five years. An implementation roadmap is expected to be published at Budget 2026 and businesses will need to be ready to engage to ensure that there is as little disruption as possible. The Chancellor delivered on the speculation of a “smorgasbord” of measures, with 44 tax measures raising a net £26.6bn per annum by 2030-31. The benefit of a smorgasbord is that the diner can choose their dishes, but the Budget was more of a stew, serving up all the measures together in one meal. The ‘meat’ of the Budget was the threshold freezes, the increase in employment and savings taxes, the new council tax surcharge and the mileage charge on EVs. In terms of sweeteners, there was the usual freeze in fuel duty and an extension of the Enterprise Management Incentives. More neutral were the changes to allowances for capital investment by businesses, with a new first year allowance but reductions in allowances for the subsequent years. Overall, the Chancellor delivered a Budget that raised less in taxes than last year and maintained the Government’s manifesto commitments, making it as palatable as could be expected for a revenue raising Budget. The Treasury Red Book ran to 146 pages but, with the Finance Bill due out next week, there is plenty of detail still to come. The budget offers a split-screen view of the UK economy: commitments to AI on one side, and tax rises that could tighten the margins for innovation on the other. Paying down national debt is a sound long-term policy, but the added tax burden will squeeze finance teams already under pressure. That makes operational integrity more critical than ever. Organisations will need clarity, accuracy, and smarter workflows to navigate the constraints. Investments in AI can also help to optimise financial discipline. It shifts the account role from “preparers” to “reviewers” and allows routine, rule-based work to be automated with high accuracy, freeing accountants to focus on strategic analysis, resource allocation, and growth initiatives. The proposed support for expanding EMI and ensuring that the tax system champions the successes of UK business, founders, and employees is hugely promising. Preserving the UK’s status as a global hub for fintech will depend on the government protecting and retaining the deep pools of talent that this industry relies on. It’s disappointing that there was no mention of any plans to back the progress made by the National Payments Vision. The UK is currently a global payments leader, and building out resilience in banking and payments will set the stage for the next decade of growth. The government needs to build on its Mansion House pledges and ensure a steady stream of capital continues to flow into high-potential companies where it can directly translate into jobs and economic growth. The Chancellor’s decision not to increase the banking surcharge has ensured the UK’s appeal to international financial institutions remains. Global banks require predictability and consistency in both regulation and taxation to plan long-term investments, which is why we welcome the Chancellor’s move. Financial services contribute around 8% of the UK’s GDP – supporting growth in this sector should remain a policy priority, not a revenue-raising exercise. While the lead-up to this Budget has hardly been uplifting – marked by fiscal pressures, sluggish growth, and rising taxes – recent tech-focused measures at least indicate that the Chancellor is beginning to make the right sounds about supporting the UK’s tech industry. The plans for an AI Growth Lab, the creation of a Sovereign AI Unit to scale national capabilities, guaranteed payments for UK startups developing AI hardware, and the decision to maintain R&D tax credits all offer a glimmer of optimism. Taken together, they underscore an intent to back a sector that government forecasts suggest could add up to £400bn to the UK economy by 2030. But sounding supportive and being supportive are not the same. The UK tech ecosystem will only reach its full potential if business leaders can rely on broader economic stability. According to the Stanford AI Index, private investment in UK AI still significantly lags behind the US ($4.5bn vs $109.1bn), highlighting ongoing challenges in attracting investment, talent, and capital. The next step for policymakers should be clear: move beyond signalling and create conditions that not only support innovation today but also build sustained investor confidence, strengthen talent pipelines, and unlock the full potential of the UK’s pioneering tech sector. Reducing the ISA allowance to £12,000 and introducing pension changes from April 2027 both risk discouraging long-term saving. Lower ISA limits reduce flexibility for tax-efficient investing, while bringing pensions into the inheritance tax net makes retirement planning more complex. Together, these measures send a signal that saving for the future is becoming less attractive. With the Chancellor’s limited scope to raise prevailing tax rates, we may see increased levels of scrutiny and enforcement being employed by HMRC as a revenue tool. It would be prudent to expect more enquiries into reorganisations, share buy-backs, goodwill valuation and business-property relief optimisation, meaning a greater focus on robust valuation methodology and tax clearances for transactional areas historically treated pragmatically. Headline corporation tax may have stayed put, but frozen income tax thresholds, tighter deductions and the effects of inflation will lift effective rates for owner-managed businesses. Increases in dividend taxation will further affect how owners extract value. Combined with sharper HMRC scrutiny, the environment is set to become more demanding for smaller corporate groups. UK budget: Frontloaded spending, backdated taxes Today’s budget was sold as a reset: headroom restored, the rules respected, and the UK put on a more sustainable fiscal path. The OBR numbers give the Chancellor some cover as the headroom has doubled since March to £21.7bn in 2029-2030 and debt is edging down at the very end of the forecast. But once you look past the scorecard, the story is much less reassuring, from a bond market perspective, though the adverse move in yields had already played out in response to Reeves’ trial balloon. Most of the consolidation is pushed into the final year of the forecast period. In the first half of the forecast, the package is dominated by spending increases and welfare loosening. The scrapping of the two-child cap from 2026, extra asylum and social spending, and some near-term capital commitments all lift borrowing in the next couple of years. By contrast, the heavy fiscal consolidation via tax is phased in late. The incremental effect of extending the threshold freezes out to 2030-31 only really bites from 2028-29 onwards: Pre-measures revisions push borrowing up and the policy package either adds to that or barely offsets it; only in 2029-30 do the accumulated tax measures and SEND judgments drive borrowing below the Spring forecast (by ~£6bn). The forecast now embeds a structurally larger state, funded in a growth-unfriendly way. On the revenue side, the tax/GDP ratio rises to a record 38.3% by 2030-31, more than 5 percentage points above its pre-COVID level. Roughly two-thirds of the post-2019 increase in the tax take comes from personal taxes, dominated by the extended threshold freezes, taxes on capital and savings income, and other various taxes (gambling, tobacco, EV’s). Conversely, public spending is projected to remain close to 44-45% of GDP, around 5 percentage points above its pre-COVID share. The slight decline late in the forecast is driven less by big reforms than by assumptions: day to day departmental budgets outside the protected areas grow more slowly in cash terms, and that a series of one-off commitments – compensation schemes, legacy COVID and energy-support costs – quietly fall away. At the same time, pressure points that are hard to turn off – welfare, local government services and high-needs SEND provision – are still moving the other way, pushed up by demographics and rising disability needs. In practice, the adjustment comes more from higher and more broadly applied taxes than from a smaller or fiscally prudent government. Debt: 97% of GDP in 28/29 Borrowing still hovers at 5.1% of GDP – dropping to 1.9% in 2029-30 – and debt now peaks at around 97% of GDP in 2028-29 before edging down owing to a one-off repayment from the Bank of England. At the same time, the OBR has cut its estimate of trend productivity growth from 1.3% to 1.0%. The downgrade lowers the path for potential output and makes the arithmetic of stabilising debt more sensitive to shocks. The OBR underlines this with its alternative scenarios: in a low-productivity case, where productivity runs at 0.5%, the current budget in 2029-30 moves from surplus back into deficit. In a high-productivity scenario, with productivity at 1.5%, the surplus roughly triples. In other words, the fiscal path now hinges heavily on an inherently uncertain view about how far the UK can lift productivity, including from AI and other technologies. Local-authority/SEND and welfare-cap risks have been acknowledged, but they are largely pushed into the next Parliament rather than resolved; the welfare cap in 2029-30 is now met with just £1.9bn of margin. In that context, the “extra” headroom – now £22bn versus £10bn in March – looks thin relative to normal forecast errors and rests heavily on late tightening and optimistic actions. For households, the Budget keeps the looming tightening front and centre. People can see that the tax state is rising – via thresholds, savings and pensions – but the real squeeze on services and departmental spending is parked in the late 2020s and not clearly explained. That is exactly the sort of backdrop that keeps the precautionary savings rate elevated, even as real incomes finally improve. Disinflation plus decent nominal wage growth should deliver positive real income growth in 2026; but higher expected future taxes and uncertainty over the quality of public services will encourage households to bank, not spend, much of that gain. Expectations of the budget were low For markets, today’s moves in gilts and sterling – volatile but a mild positive sentiment – show that the expectations of the Budget were low. On paper, the rules are met and headroom is larger. But further down the line, investors will see higher debt and a back-loaded consolidation that is hard to believe ahead of an election, especially with Reform and anti-austerity narratives gaining traction. The mix is not pro-growth as the tax rises hit savings and investment returns, and the spending path implies future squeezes on areas that support productivity (local services, non-protected departments that are not the NHS, perhaps some public capital). For equities, the conclusion is broadly similar. Fiscal policy looks more like a mild headwind than a clear catalyst. If UK-facing equities perform reasonably well over the next 12-18 months, that is more likely to reflect the underlying macro backdrop than anything in this Budget: In that environment, domestic cyclicals and UK-exposed names can still do acceptably well despite a high-tax, high-spend, back-loaded consolidation plan. The Budget itself does little to change the medium-term growth story one way or the other: it reduces the risk of a near-term fiscal accident, but continues to stymie the narrative for stronger trend growth. Banks dodge a bullet as Reeves keeps tax changes off the table UK lenders emerged largely unscathed from today’s Autumn Budget. Shares had been edging higher into the announcement on whispers that the sector would be spared – and a collective sigh of relief once Rachel Reeves took her seat confirmed those rumours, propelling Lloyds, Barclays and peers into the day’s top risers. Reeves resisted calls for sweeping tax changes, leaving the industry outside the political crosshairs – for now. It’s a delicate balancing act: banks are posting bumper profits, and few voters would have mourned tougher levies. Yet policymakers know the stakes. Push too hard, and the UK risks hobbling a critical engine of credit, investment and growth. The sector already shoulders one of the world’s heaviest tax loads. Further hikes could have dented London’s competitiveness – a point CEOs have hammered home, particularly global players who might rethink their UK footprint if the screws tighten. Valuations aren’t as compelling as they were earlier in the cycle, but upside remains. UK banks are well-capitalised, highly profitable, and positioned to deliver stronger shareholder returns through 2026. For investors, the story has moved on from scraping a living to one about steady, disciplined growth. Balanced Budget keeps gilt yields stable post leak wobble All bond investor eyes in the UK are on gilt yields for Budget day. Yields spiked a little initially, but the market has been sanguine since in the build up to Reeves’ speech. The leak of the OBR forecasts caused some volatility, falling then rising before falling again as the speech began. The 10-year is under 4.45% at the time of writing (they closed at 4.5% yesterday), putting it near the bottom of its range so far in 2025. Moves of 0.05% are relatively common. Over 2025, there have been two trends in gilt yields. Short-dated yields of up to 5 years have generally fallen while medium and long-dated yields (10-year and longer) have been broadly range bound (while very long-dated yields had been on an increasing trend until September, moves since then have brought them back down below where they started the year). During October, in the build up to the Budget, yields fell across the board. This reflected expectations that the Budget was going to contain notable tax increases and bring greater confidence in the government’s ability to balance the books in future. These falls were scuppered earlier in November when it was leaked that expected income tax rises had been scrapped, leaving investors scratching their heads as to how the government was going to increase revenues. Coming into today, gilt investors were hoping for measures that allowed them to have greater confidence in fiscal responsibility going forward, which would have allowed yields to fall (and prices rise). So far, the government hasn’t provided much by way of surprises for bond investors, evidenced by the relatively small moves in yields so far. As ever though, the devil will be in the detail so things could over the coming hours and days. Why do gilt yields matter? When the government wants to borrow money, it issues Gilts (UK government bonds) to the bond market. Bond investors demand interest in return for lending the government money. Gilt yields are the interest rate that the UK government has to pay in order to borrow money. The UK has had a budget deficit for many years – meaning they’ve spent more than they have received in revenues. In fact, there’s only been 5 years since 1970/71 where there has been a budget surplus in the UK, and the last time this happened was 2000/01. When the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it has to borrow to make up the difference. The gilt yield matters because it impacts the cost of borrowing – the higher the yield, the higher the cost of borrowing. Importantly, changing gilt yields don’t impact the cost of debt already issued. But they do impact the cost to borrow in future. And it’s common for the government to have to refinance previous borrowing as gilts mature and large maturity payments become due. If they’ve borrowed cheaply in the past and it costs them more to borrow today, as they refinance historic debt, their interest costs will increase. The opposite is also true. Higher costs of borrowing could reduce future government spending This is why governments worry so much about their bond yields. We’ve seen a couple of events in recent years where changes in bond yields have forced a change in government policy. The most obvious was the Truss / Kwarteng mini-Budget in 2022. But the US had a similar issue in April, following Liberation Day, with rises to US Treasury yields cited as one potential reason Trump backed down from his initial tariff implementation date of 9 April. Following the Spring Statement in March, it was estimated that the UK Government would need to issue £300bn of gilts in the 2025/26 tax year. The figure for 2026/27 was slightly lower in the region of £275bn. If the average cost of debt reduces by around 1%, this would save the government roughly £6bn in interest costs per year for gilts issued in the two financial years from 2025-2027. The opposite is also true. In a world where big numbers get thrown about without much consideration for their size, it’s worth just reiterating that £6bn is £6,000,000,000. That’s the equivalent of 120,000 government employees (teachers, nurses, police officers etc) at an average salary of £50,000. Gilt yields matter and not just for investment returns. The Lifetime ISA has provided an essential boost for hard-pressed young buyers, desperate to get into the property ladder. It has also proved a valuable way for people to save for retirement, especially self-employed people, who fall seriously short when it comes to pension contributions. The right consultation on its replacement is vital, and needs to ensure that dedicated savers and investors, who have been putting money away for their first property or for retirement aren’t disadvantaged by any change. Today’s announcement on the Lifetime ISA will be worrying for those who rely on it for their retirement savings. The LISA has the ability to have a huge impact on the retirement prospects for groups such as the self-employed. This is a group that is not included in auto-enrolment and so miss out on an employer contributions. They may also find pensions lack the flexibility that they need given as money cannot be accessed until at least the age of 55. The bonus on the Lifetime ISA has the same effect as basic rate tax relief on a pension and any income can be taken tax free after the age 60. Added to this, money can be accessed early in case of emergency, albeit subject to an exit charge. It’s a product has the potential on the long-term resilience of this group. The consultation into a replacement must consider the needs of self-employed people saving for retirement. They are already under-saving, so it’s important not to put any more barriers in the way. VCT tax blow hidden in small print The Chancellor has delivered a blow to investor and early-stage businesses alike by slashing the tax relief available on venture capital trusts. The Budget speech led with the positive news that both annual and lifetime limits would be reviewed to support scale up and not just start-up companies. This will be warmly welcomed by the industry which has called for limits to be re-examined to support broader growth opportunities. But hidden in the small print of the Budget document was the detail that in order to ‘balance’ this change, the tax relief on VCTs would be cut from 30% to 20% following the 2025/26 financial bill – so investors have until the end of the tax year before the changes come into force. We are encouraged by the measures announced in the Budget to support a retail investment culture, including the stamp duty tax break for IPOs, and the British investment hub. However, the tax relief on VCTs has provided many investors with the incentive to support early-stage UK businesses, which in turn support the domestic economy – just the sort of growth this Government is championing. This tax change seems counter to that agenda. Government should be applauded for EIS limit increase and VentureLink initiative Increasing EIS caps is noteworthy and should be praised. For over 30 years now, this scheme has been vital in channelling investment into early-stage companies, and by lifting the amount a company can raise through EIS the Chancellor will help ensure that the most promising scaleups – those already approaching their EIS cap – can access more capital to support their long-term growth. The new VentureLink initiative is equally positive. Unlocking more private investment into British businesses by utilising capital in pension funds was first outlined under the Tories, but proper mechanisms are required for this to take effect – charging the British Business Bank to consult on the development of VentureLink to enable pension funds to invest in private companies is a wise move by Labour, and one that we should applaud. Lifting EMI cap is positive Widening the scope of Enterprise Management Incentives is a positive move. These allow small businesses to incentivise employees by offering them share options without NI or income tax liabilities, and it’s a powerful weapon in a startup’s arsenal as they battle to attract and retain the best possible talent. In the mission to ensure the UK remains as attractive as possible to entrepreneurs and, more importantly, a great country in which to scale a company, these little fixes can make a big difference, so the Chancellor has done the right thing today by ensuring more small businesses can leverage EMIs. Good news – R&D left alone and no wealth tax For the tech sector, leaving R&D tax credits alone was a good outcome. SMEs need certainty and stability if they are to plan for the future effectively – and this isn’t possible when policy and taxation are constantly changing, so the Chancellor was right to avoid the temptation to tinker with this. Similarly, the fact that some form of ‘wealth tax’ wasn’t introduced is good news, even if the broader tax landscape has become less favourable across the past two Budgets. A targeted wealth tax would likely have a negative impact on private investments – such as the availability of private equity and VC funding for high-growth startups – making it counterproductive for productivity and economic growth. HSBC UK is proud to support over 15 million customers and welcomes the Government’s efforts to drive growth across the country. We are therefore pleased to make available over £11bn of measures to back businesses and households.We are supporting UK SMEs by making an additional £5bn of lending available over the next five years. This will underpin the growth ambitions of thousands of small businesses across the country, helping deliver on the objectives in the Government’s Small Business Plan.We will increase cashback to first-time buyers from £700 to £2000 to help with the cost of buying a home. This is expected to mean an additional £1bn of lending and builds on our programme to increase borrowing limits for first-time buyers, allowing 24,000 more customers to get onto the housing ladder. We will invest over £100m in our network – including ATMs – over the next three years and maintain our existing bank branch network in 2026. We will also create 1,000 highly skilled jobs over the next five years, offering mortgage and investment support to first-time buyers, homeowners and retail investors. We will make available an additional £1bn of financing to the social housing sector in 2026 and a further £4bn by 2030. This will support the construction, renovation and management of tens of thousands of new social homes across the country. By making available over £11bn of financing support, we can go further in driving SME expansion, helping first-time buyers onto the property ladder and supporting the customers and communities we are proud to serve. The 2025 Budget locks in a structurally higher tax environment, with frozen thresholds, increased dividend and savings taxes, and tighter pension rules reshaping how UK clients save, invest and manage risk. These aren’t cyclical adjustments, they will alter domestic capital flows and retail trading patterns for the long term. For INFINOX and similar multi-market brokers, the near-term impact will be tighter domestic liquidity as households absorb the fiscal shift. But over time, we expect greater appetite for global diversification, FX hedging and non-UK exposures as clients rebalance portfolios away from a compressed domestic market. The £22bn fiscal headroom may stabilise gilt markets and dampen volatility at the policy level, but the broader environment remains one of consolidation rather than stimulus. In practice, this means clients will look for clearer risk frameworks, more transparent execution, and broader cross-border market access. For a globally positioned firm, the Budget underscores the importance of scalable infrastructure, disciplined risk management and multi-jurisdictional market access, all essential for helping clients navigate a landscape where structural tax pressures and shifting capital allocations become defining features of the trading environment. I do not believe that today’s budget will do much, if anything, to reverse the dour mood in the British business community, and especially the FinTech industry, which has incredible potential if only it could be unlocked. Looking at what the Budget offered from a business perspective, it failed to address the long-term systemic issues that have led investment to fall alongside profits. In the first half of the year the UK’s FinTech industry bought in $7.2 billion USD in investment in H1 of 2025, down only 5% from the previous year. That seems like a staggering amount of money, but it is only a fraction of what the country’s innovative financial companies could expect pre-2021. The heady pre-pandemic days paved the way for major international success stories like Monzo and Revolut, but it seems unlikely that we’ll have other companies who can be just as successful until things change. Before the budget, I suggested that what UK FinTechs need is targeted interventions to bring down barriers between ideas and investment, making sure that the next person who comes up with an idea that has the potential to be the next Revolut has the finances, infrastructure and staff that they need to scale. We didn’t see anything approaching that in this budget, so it will be down to the industry itself to work in collaboration to build these institutions. We still have incredible opportunities to grow in the UK. London remains the finance capital of the world and our population is educated and entrepreneurial. We just need the pressure off so we can get back to work. If a buy-to-let investor wasn’t already reviewing their portfolio, they certainly will be now. The 2% increase on income tax from properties adds yet another straw to the back of an already weakened camel. A long running theme of hammering property owners with stealth taxes, higher administrative burdens, capital gains taxes and a lack of long-overdue Stamp Duty reform leaves the market very weak. Property as an asset class is a shadow of its former self, and we expect many investors to look elsewhere for easier, more stable and fulsome returns. We are very disappointed to see the Government’s announcement on another Lifetime ISA consultation. The Lifetime ISA has been a lifeline for first time buyers and has positively changed the savings habits of a generation. Today’s announcement will cause huge concern and uncertainty for existing users, many of whom lay at the heart of the home affordability challenge. We urge the Government to reassure the 1.5 million Lifetime ISA savers that they will not be disadvantaged by this consultation and that the positive steps they have taken to secure their financial future won’t go to waste. As the UK’s leading provider of the Lifetime ISA, we have long campaigned for targeted reforms to future-proof this fantastic product. In September, following the Treasury Select Committee consultation, the Government formally recognised the importance of the Lifetime ISA in supporting first time buyers. Today it should have built on these findings and committed to future-proofing measures such as an annual review of the property price cap and a reduction in the withdrawal penalty from 25% to 20%.With no broader first-time buyer support in this Budget, all the government has done is create instability and uncertainty for the only product it currently offers to support young savers. Cash ISA The Cash ISA is the UK’s most popular savings vehicle, so today’s cut to the annual tax-free limit will understandably cause concern for many. In fact, in the 24/25 tax year, two-fifths of Moneybox Cash ISA customers deposited more than £12,000, indicating that this reduction in the allowance will impact a substantial proportion of savers.It is vital that the government recognises that cash savings remain the bedrock of financial confidence and a cornerstone of financial resilience. A strong cash buffer is what ultimately gives people the confidence to invest over time. At Moneybox, we see more than a million people — many on modest incomes — relying on tax-wrapped accounts to build security and plan for the future. Sudden changes to allowances risk undermining that confidence.We support the government’s ambition to encourage more people to invest for stronger long-term returns but it is widely accepted that cutting the Cash ISA allowance alone will not create an investing culture. Real change requires policy stability, a clear long-term savings and investment strategy, and meaningful support for those who are less confident about investing. Salary Sacrifice The Chancellor’s decision to cut pension salary sacrifice will directly hit the wallets of working people and undermine the incentive to save more for retirement at a time when we already face a crisis in pension adequacy.Today’s announcement is a clear example of short-termism. By making pension saving less attractive, future generations will not only bear the cost of supporting the over 14 million people already undersaving, but also the many others negatively affected by this cut to salary sacrifice. It is crucial that the Government reconsiders this policy and delivers a pension system that truly meets the needs of the nation. Pensions From April 2029, capping salary sacrifice pension contributions at £2,000 a year is forecast to raise £4.7bn – making it the second-biggest revenue source after the three-year tax threshold freeze. Taken with the freeze on income tax thresholds, these changes will impact more people than expected. At auto-enrolment contribution rates, a pre-tax employee contribution of 4% reaches £2,000 per year at a £50,000 salary. This is very close to the higher rate income tax band, and by 2029 one in seven UK taxpayers are expected to pay higher rate tax and so might be affected by the salary sacrifice changes. From April 2029, pension contributions above the £2000 limit will attract 2% NICs for employees and 15% for employers. The amounts could be significant: the expected £4.7bn raised averages to around £1,000 per higher rate taxpayer, mostly in employer’s NICs. Faced with what is effectively another increase in national insurance, albeit only on higher earners, employers may reconsider whether to scale back the generosity of their pensions offer. Over the past 20 years, many employers that adopted salary sacrifice have passed on the benefit of reduced NICs by offering more generous pension contributions. It’s unclear whether employers will absorb the additional cost or seek to recoup it with less generous employer contributions. Meanwhile, the cost of state benefits to the retired generation continues to escalate.Today’s workers are effectively funding their parents’ retirement – without any certainty that they will receive equally generous benefits. Successive Chancellors have shied away from reforming the state pension Triple Lock, which demands an increasing share of tax each year, while implementing changes (such as the salary sacrifice cap) that discourage today’s workers from saving for their own future.” Retail savings and investments Lifetime ISAs are expected to be scrapped in 2026 and replaced with a simpler ISA product, geared towards supporting first time buyers.Lifetime ISAs have been popular with savers, but there has always been a concern that people could miss out on tax benefits and employer contributions if they opted for a Lifetime ISA over a pension. If they are abolished, the industry is unlikely to feel their loss. This is a Budget designed to encourage investment. Taxes on income from property, dividends and savings rise by 2 percentage points, narrowing the gap to earned income. The Cash ISA limit is reduced for the under 65s. The combined effect is to steer savers towards long term investment rather than property or cash. The market has responded positively: shares in wealth platforms jumped following the announcement. The UK tech sector, including fintech, contributes over £280bn to the UK economy and employs nearly three million people. After so much pre-Budget speculation, providing certainty around taxation and regulation for such a critical part of the economy was vital. The Budget takes meaningful steps toward providing that stability, which will be welcomed across a sector where confidence and predictability are crucial to long-term investment. The announcements on investment for growth-stage and scale-up businesses, alongside tax breaks for companies listing in the UK, will help attract global talent and further reinforce the UK’s position as a leading fintech hub. We also welcome the strong emphasis on AI, with the Chancellor building on previously announced measures with confirmation of further AI Growth Zones across the UK. This represents exactly the kind of ambition needed to keep the country at the forefront of emerging technologies and will be vital to ensuring AI can be deployed across sectors like financial services, from streamlining payments to combating illicit activity such as fraud. However, there are areas where further progress is still needed. The Chancellor’s Leeds Reforms, designed to cut red tape and strengthen the UK’s role as a global financial centre, received only a brief mention in today’s Budget and no new detail. Greater clarity and ambition will be crucial if the UK is to truly cement its leadership in financial services on the global stage. Today’s Autumn budget will have been watched closely by money-conscious consumers, and for many the outcome of the Chancellor’s announcement will be unsettling. Amid larger questions consumers will inevitably have around income tax, savings and pensions, we believe this is a good moment to take stock. Importantly, the banking market will adjust to today’s announcement, and major fiscal events such as this often lead to a more competitive landscape. Switching bank accounts is a great example how a healthy banking system retains that competition and value for customers. Switching levels in the UK remain continuously high, and consumers are increasingly willing to bank with a provider that better meets their needs. With today’s changes in mind, banks and building societies across the UK will review what they’re offering customers, and as a result there could be a bank account out there that is better suited to your own needs and goals. While we understand that there is no silver bullet to remedy financial worry, reflecting on whether you have the right bank account for your needs and goals is a simple first step to take, and one entirely within your control. The Government’s decision to cap salary sacrifice NI relief from 2029, as announced in the Autumn Budget, is a backward step for boosting pension saving. While the cap will mainly affect higher earners, salary sacrifice has been one of the most effective tools to encourage people to save more than the auto-enrolment minimums – and limiting it risks slowing progress at a time when the UK is already facing a serious retirement savings gap. The more significant change is the government’s decision to revisit the State Pension through a new Commission and age review. That tells us the current system is under pressure and will need to evolve to stay sustainable. For today’s savers, it reinforces a simple truth: relying on the State Pension alone won’t deliver the retirement most people hope for. People can be reassured by the fact that core pension rules remain unchanged formnow – and by the fact that consistent contributions still go the furthest in shaping a comfortable retirement. But long-term policy clarity is essential. Sudden changes and uncertainty make it harder for people to plan, and harder for the public to trust the system. At Penfold, we’ll continue building the tools, education and support that help people take control of their financial futures. Pension saving should feel stable, predictable and empowering – not at the mercy of short-term fiscal decisions. This tax rise could put more pressure on an already strained rental market as landlords might now look to sell their properties to avoid paying higher tax bills. I recommend that property owners review their investments and recalculate their returns to ensure that they are clear on what this tax rise will mean for them. While the Chancellor is expecting to raise £2.1bn overall through personal tax rises, this property tax increase could put rent affordability under further pressure as well. Landlords may attempt to offset the increased tax burden by charging higher rents. Furthermore, if some landlords decide to sell up, the rental market becomes strained, which again may lead to higher prices for renters, as well as more competition in securing tenancies. A balanced approach that recognises the importance of private landlords in providing housing and protects renters from high rent costs is needed, as both are essential to the stability of the property market. However, now that the various personal tax rises have been confirmed, this certainty allows landlords to reassess their margins and plan for the future after much speculation and uncertainty. Renters should also keep an eye on any potential increase in rent costs in line with this tax increase. Today’s announcement of a three-year exemption from UK stamp duty for newly listed shares will come as welcome news to participants in the UK capital markets. While tax is only one factor in a company’s decision to list in the UK, this change will hopefully provide a shot in the arm to UK markets at a time of increasing global competition for company listings, removing one area of friction in support of the Government’s aim of boosting demand for UK equities. The reversal of last year’s ‘giveaway’ that there would be no extension to frozen income tax thresholds beyond 2028 means a further five years of fiscal drag which will continue to hit the public in the pocket. This, compounded by the increase in Employers’ National Insurance Contributions last year, means that nearly a quarter of taxpayers will be paying the higher rate by 2030. This Budget has not been short of surprises. The biggest was that the downgrade to the economic forecasts was far smaller than anticipated. The Chancellor could have chosen to sit tight, but instead has delivered a substantial package of tax rises to fund some extra spending and to bolster the fiscal headroom. Crucially, a larger cushion against her fiscal rules will reduce the likelihood of further fiscal tinkering in the next Budget. Think tax and save, rather than tax and spend. The Chancellor claims she is ‘championing innovation’ and ‘backing working people’, yet today’s measures tell a different story. While she faces a difficult balancing act, the government is once again making choices that will weigh heavily on British businesses, especially those trying to grow, hire, and innovate. For a government that says, ‘private investment is the lifeblood of economic growth’, taxing that investment more heavily is a contradictory signal. Hiking dividend tax, freezing income tax thresholds, and tightening rules on salary sacrifice add up to a stealth tax on growth, squeezing cash flow and increasing the cost of doing business. These policies penalise millions of ordinary savers and early-stage investors, and disincentivise the very risk-takers we need to create jobs and attract investment. For companies in Fintech – sectors that thrive on investment and reinvestment – these moves risk undermining the very entrepreneurial energy that has made the UK a hub for innovation. Discouraging long-term saving and shrinking the upside for investors will make it much harder to attract risk capital, scale operations, or plan with confidence. That said, challenging times have a way of sharpening resolve. For firms with vision and discipline, this could still be a moment to double down on lean, high-impact strategies. We welcome the expansion of the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme and the UK listing relief. Those incentives matter, and the recognition that scale-ups need long-term support is the right message. To truly compete on a global stage, UK fintech and innovation need a world-beating, simple, and ambitious incentive regime. We hope today is the first step in that conversation, not the end of it. Budget reforms should incentivise saving without adding additional burdens While the Chancellor’s push to incentivise young, working Britons to invest their money is laudable, a reduction to cash ISA limits is only effective if it comes with a far-reaching educational campaign to demystify investing. The forthcoming changes to financial advice and the launch of online hubs may well help encourage broader participation in non-cash assets, but we should not penalise diligent savers by pushing their cash into taxable environments, as this will serve to increase the tax burden on working Britons, decreasing national consumption. As the Chancellor said in her speech, the UK has the lowest retail investment rates in the G7, with under a quarter of British adults holding stocks. The increase in the dividend tax rate announced today is a further disincentive to investment, particularly for small businesses owners who take their income via dividends. To counterbalance this and show entrepreneurs that Britain is a good home for business, the Government should also consider increasing CGT allowances. The Chancellor’s decision to introduce a yearly cap on National Insurance-free salary sacrifice will similarly impact our savings rates, a move which will be detrimental to UK stock markets and everyday people alike. With Britons presently struggling to save for retirement, adding an extra burden will undermine long-term financial security and create additional barriers to saving. Failing to introduce dedicated RegTech R&D tax credits is not just a significant missed opportunity, but also a strategic oversight. Innovate Finance and voices across the industry have been clear about what founders need. According to KPMG, RegTech is gaining significant investor interest, especially across EMEA, as regulatory compliance grows more complex. The UK has everything required to lead, but without targeted support, we hand a competitive advantage to jurisdictions moving faster to back next-generation compliance technology. Greater clarity on capital gains treatment, entrepreneur relief, and modernised EIS/EMI rules is exactly what founders have been calling for. This is a strong signal that the Government recognises how vital fiscal stability is for scaling high-growth sectors like RegTech. This makes the UK an even more attractive place to build and scale financial innovation and reinforces London’s position as the natural home for RegTech globally. Any steps to tackle financial hardship via reversals to previous cuts to winter fuel payments and the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap are positive, but the OBR predicts that the latter will only impact 560,000 families. Balancing the books is no easy task, however the Chancellor’s previous warning that ‘everyone will have to contribute’ overlooks what it takes to boost confidence. Over 20 million UK consumers are currently classed as financially vulnerable but tend to fall between the cracks of the system. They are not on the breadline, they have steady jobs, they are financially responsible. Yet they are locked out of mainstream credit because of fundamental flaws in how the industry operates and therefore prevented from ‘contributing’ via spending. If there is to be true commitment to boosting productivity, it should start by a broader look at addressing financial exclusion – £6.4bn could be added to UK GDP by doing so. Pulling tax levers just won’t cut it, so it’s imperative that the Government collaborates with lenders and credit rating agencies to facilitate better lending practices. Gilts calm for now, sterling posts month-high post-Budget, Wall St rallies Post-Budget, gilt markets seem reasonably quiet though we have seen a slight tick-up in yields this morning after declining yesterday. Sterling trades at its best in a month against the dollar, though has come back off the overnight highs this morning to $1.3223. EURGBP has seen less of a move as it ran up against the 50-day SMA support, a three-week high for the pound. The FTSE 250 has risen but the FTSE 100 dipped early on Thursday following two days of solid progress.The Budget was frontloaded with spending and backloaded with paying for it Borrowing will rise, according to the OBR and issuance next year is sharply higher, according to the DMO. So why are gilt yields down and the pound at a month high? It’s probably down to a reduction in the political risk associated with the Starmer/Reeves leadership, which has been key to holding the bond market on a relatively tight leash.That doesn’t mean political risk has gone away with this patchwork of tax hikes and giveaways – start pulling at the threads and the whole thing might unravel. There are assumptions about growth that are too optimistic and about welfare policy that probably won’t stand up to reality or scrutiny, moreover there is myriad of complications with implementation of say, the ISA changes, or salary sacrifice reform. Take the Send budget – the OBR warns of a “significant fiscal risk” as the government has not set out how it plans to pay for extra spending. There is a black hole looming at the Department for Education. The govt seems content to worry about that in 2028.I still believe the entire assumption around spend now and pay for it later won’t survive deeper scrutiny from the markets. The Budget does nothing to fundamentally improve the UK’s fiscal position, boost growth, or improve the twin deficits – but it seems it has bought the Chancellor some grace and lower bond yields will buy her some extra headroom. That is maybe the best she could have hoped for aftera Budget that does a) nothing to boost growth, b) nothing to cut spending, and actually raises, c) raises taxation on the most productive parts of the economy, d) implies reform of welfare that the government has signally failed to deliver so far, and e) offers broad assumptions that do not seem credible at all given the election cycle.The market for now is rewarding more fiscal headroom with lower yields, but I would note that the move in the US 10yr yesterday, which spiked and then settled below 4%, was pretty close to that of the 10yr gilt. Today is Thanksgiving so there should be little from the US until Monday. Gilts will have to manage on their own for a day or two. Bookmaker stocks are down The sector has issued warnings about the impact of tax hikes. The Chancellor announced yesterday that Remote Gaming Duty is set to increase from 21% to 40% from April 2026, and a new online sports betting duty of 25% will be applicable to sports excluding horse racing from April 2027, replacing the existing 15% General Betting Duty. Flutter reports impact before mitigation to be approximately $320m in fiscal 2026 and $540m in fiscal 2027. Evoke, which tumbled yesterday on the news, estimates a hit of approximately £125-135m on an annualised basis once fully implemented from April 2027 and pulled its medium-term guidance. Entain put the damage at £200m next year and £100m this year. Rank, which owns Gala bingo, fell 10% after saying the measures will hurt operating profit by £40m.The FTSE 100 was flat just shy of 9,700 in early trade on Thursday before turning lower after two solid days of gains. Bank shares continued to gain after popping yesterday as they were spared from a tax raid. JPMorgan, with impeccable timing, says it will open a giant new skyscraper in Canary Wharf. Clearly the banks bought the three-line whip on supporting the Budget. Maybe they’re also buying gilts? US markets are back on track The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq each posting a fourth straight day of gains on Wednesday. Nvidia picked up some bid to rise 1.4%, while Oracle arrested its decline to rally 4% as Deutsche Bank said the pullback in shares “presents an attractive entry point for investors when looking at Oracle’s business in totality. Today’s Budget measures are a starting point at attempting to reinvigorate the business, and subsequently, fintech, ecosystem. The three-year stamp duty holiday for new share listings, for example, is a positive move, but it only helps IPO-ready businesses on the path to listing. To fuel the next generation of fast-growth fintechs, more needs to be done to help earlier stage businesses. We sincerely hope that the consultation to increase support for scale ups and attract more entrepreneurs happens swiftly so that the UK stands a chance at being a destination for innovation and growth. As many speculated, the Autumn Budget has highlighted tough economic conditions and delivered fresh challenges for UK businesses to face. Many businesses, particularly SMBs, will be impacted by the rise in national minimum wage, cap on NI exemption for the pension salary sacrifice and the slash on WDAs (writing down allowances). In response, some companies may panic pivot to blunt cost-cutting measures like hiring freezes or redundancies, but that approach risks damaging long-term growth. Our recent research found that 88% of UK finance leaders believe restricting employees’ access to budgets actually stifles business growth. Because when smart spending is hindered or put on hold, opportunities get delayed and productivity suffers. The focus therefore shouldn’t be on hastily cutting costs, but being smarter about where spend goes. By investing in transparent spend management tools and empowering teams with real-time visibility and control, businesses can protect efficiency and make every pound work harder. Financial control is about making informed, proactive decisions that safeguard efficiency and growth, even in uncertain times. This is a moment for sensible reform of the Lifetime ISA, not a rush to scrap it. LISAs have helped a generation of first-time buyers save for a deposit and, crucially, given many – particularly the self-employed – a simple, engaging way to build retirement savings. As the government consults on a new ISA for homebuyers, it must protect the strengths of the LISA and give clarity and fair treatment to existing savers – not dismantle a product that is already delivering for those trying to save for both a first home and later life. As a lender to mid-sized businesses, the key question from today’s Budget for us is whether it will support growth and encourage borrowing. Judging by the policies announcement, it will be a challenge for many, more so for smaller businesses, who are less resilient and are already addressing higher taxes and employee costs. This is alongside the proposals to strengthen employee rights. Salary sacrifice changes will add further costs to business, while undermining pension savings – at a time when we want pension schemes to be investing in UK assets and growth businesses. Changes to CGT rules on Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) will undoubtedly dampen what has become a popular route for owner and family managed businesses exploring a sale, albeit we may see an acceleration in deals before the new rules take effect in April. There are some positives – notably the freezing of fuel duty, rate relief for small businesses and strengthening the Enterprise Management Incentive, but these pale in comparison. This is not going to stop businesses from growing, acquiring and investing, especially mid-sized businesses who will be planning years in advance, but for certain sectors and for companies at different points of the cycle, it will delay plans and reduce borrower appetite. As many expected, today’s Budget has delivered tax increases totalling £26bn in an effort to tackle debt and protect public services, leaving businesses understandably on alert. Many will now have little choice but to reassess their plans for the 2026 financial year and look closely at where they can drive efficiencies. Our recent research shows that 70% of UK finance professionals believe outdated finance processes are limiting growth, yet nearly half (47%) still rely on manual or mostly manual systems. In a volatile economic environment, that’s a real concern, especially as 51% say global trade pressures like tariffs are already hindering expansion plans. Combined with fiscal uncertainty at home, the need for agility has never been greater. This is exactly the kind of fiscal uncertainty that exposes the weaknesses of manual finance operations. Automation gives leaders the visibility and foresight they need to make better decisions, faster. By modernising their operations now, UK businesses can build resilience and stay one step ahead, whatever direction future Budgets take. We recognise the Chancellor faced tough choices in this Budget and welcome the ongoing support she has shown for the financial services sector. This sends an important signal to international markets that the UK is focused on growth and attracting investment. The changes to Stamp Duty for newly-listed companies will help encourage more trading in UK companies. A strong economy needs a strong financial sector, which in turn backs jobs, businesses and the whole economy. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the government to support its growth mission and the wider economy. If we want AI to genuinely raise productivity, the government must go beyond investment and needs to become an enthusiastic customer for startups. As an AI founder, I see daily how much potential there is to make public services and regulated industries more efficient. If the UK wants to build and keep world-leading AI companies, procurement frameworks must reward technologies that deliver trustworthy, consistent automation. As well as capital, founders need customers willing to adopt, test and scale innovative products. By using its own buying power, alongside targeted R&D programmes, the government can set the pace for the wider economy. That’s the clearest way to ensure the UK remains a global home for ambitious, high-growth companies. The Autumn Budget delivered by the UK Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has introduced a series of tax changes that could significantly impact savers, investors, landlords, and business owners. While Reeves technically upheld her election promise not to raise income tax for working people, the extension of the income tax threshold freeze until 2031 has allowed fiscal drag to quietly increase tax burdens.From April 2026, income tax on dividends will rise by two percentage points for basic and higher rate taxpayers (note: the additional rate applicable to dividends will remain at 39.35%), while income tax on savings and rental income (land & buildings) will rise by two percentage points for basic, high rate and additional rate taxpayers from April 2027. This move is set to affect savers, investors, business owners, and landlords, prompting many to reassess their financial strategies. With capital gains tax rates left unchanged, investors may now be encouraged to scrutinise how gains are generated within their portfolios. Savers, too, might consider shifting cash holdings into more tax-efficient structures, such as ISAs or offshore bonds, to mitigate the impact of these changes. Landlords: The outlook remains challenging The additional 2% income tax on rental income compounds the existing tax burdens, including higher stamp duty rates, capital gains tax on property sales, and inheritance tax (IHT) on death. Non-professional landlords holding properties in their own names may find this an opportune moment to evaluate the profitability of their rental portfolios and explore alternative, more tax-efficient structuring options. On a more positive note, the government has refined its approach to business and agricultural property reliefs. Following extensive consultation, the rules now allow for the full spousal / civil partner transfer of the £1m IHT allowance. This change aligns these reliefs more closely with the broader IHT framework and provides a valuable tool for effective estate planning. Savers under the age of 65 will face new restrictions on cash ISA allowances, which will be capped at £12,000 annually from April 2027, with an additional £8,000 allowance for investment ISAs. Coupled with the cap on national insurance contribution (NIC) relief on salary sacrifice into pension schemes to the first £2,000 of pension contributions (from 2029), these changes may encourage a shift in mindset, positioning ISAs as complementary retirement savings vehicles alongside pensions. Despite the pre-Budget speculation, the announcements were less dramatic than anticipated. Key elements of the tax landscape, such as tax-free cash, potentially exempt transfers & the seven-year rule, and capital gains tax rates, remain unchanged. For those affected by the new measures, this Budget presents an opportunity to revisit financial plans, optimise tax efficiency, and ensure wealth is structured effectively for the future. As the dust settles, the focus will now shift to how individuals and businesses can adapt to these changes and make the most of the planning opportunities they present. Taken together, these two measures appear to be an acknowledgement that the changes announced in last year’s Budget to the non-dom regime went too far, that the UK has lost too many of these individuals, and that policymakers have to do more to stem this outflow and get the country back to becoming an attractive destination for wealth. This is particularly important given the country’s top 1% of taxpayers contribute to a third of all tax revenue. However, questions marks remain as to whether these measures will be effective in restoring trust among non-doms and the wider HNW community and prevent further departures. The £5m cap, while limiting the amount non-doms may ultimately have to settle, still represents a significant new charge for individuals who previously paid nothing before April 2025. Additionally, with the Government announcing £26 billion of tax-raising measures in this Budget alone, it is difficult to see how this will encourage new wealthy individuals to move to the UK. With the Chancellor on the hunt at this Budget for tax rises to help plug the fiscal hole – largely borne by the shoulders of the wealthiest – it is no surprise that the Capital Gains Tax regime has been revisited, including the reduction of capital gains relief on disposals to employee ownership trusts from 100% to 50%. These further changes could materially impact behaviours around investment. Those affected will need to act swiftly, reassessing and adapting their financial plans to navigate the UK’s evolving tax environment. On Inheritance Tax statistics IHT receipts are forecast to raise £9bn in 2025/26, a 4.5% increase from last year with receipts expected to continue to increase over the forecast period, driven by rising house and equity prices and the impact of the polices announced at the Autumn Budget 2024 reaching £14.5bn in 2030/31. Relative to the OBR’s March forecast, receipts are expected to be £0.8bn lower by 2029/30 due to lower in-year outturn which is only partially offset by higher forecast equity prices. Inheritance Tax receipts are set to increase from last year and over the forecast period as frozen thresholds, rising asset prices, a tightening of the regime at the Autumn 2024 Budget and extending the freeze on IHT free allowances combine to drive increasing collections for the Treasury. It sets the scene for continued demand for professional advice as high-net-worth clients look to understand how they may be impacted. The £8,000 element reserved for investment is a helpful measure that adds to the growing momentum in the London IPO market with companies and investors once again eyeing the longer-term attractiveness of the UK as a listing venue. It builds on the recent regulatory changes enacted by the FCA and LSE that have levelled the playing field with other leading listing venues and strengthened London’s competitiveness. In particular, this measure should support greater retail investor participation in the stock market, boost liquidity, access to capital for companies and bring the UK more in line with other successful jurisdictions with strong cultures of retail investing. Today’s Budget sends a clear and important message to the UK’s entrepreneurs like myself. The government is signalling loud and clear that if you build here, Britain will back you. As a British‑founded business, Yaspa welcomes this commitment and is proud to be part of a community that drives innovation, creates jobs, and grows the economy. We are excited to continue to grow and expand, and we look forward to engaging actively in the discussions the government has launched. Support like this will help unlock long‑term investment, give UK start‑ups the chance to scale, and ensure businesses like ours can hire, innovate, and invest in the future of Britain.

Computer and printer maker HP's (HPQ) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced a major cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs. The company said it aims to eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 roles as part of its efforts to save $1 billion over the next three fiscal years. For HP, which said it had about 58,000 employees in its latest annual filing, the cuts could represent up to 10% of its workforce. Meanwhile, CEO Enrique Lores told investors during Tuesday's earnings call that the company plans to continue investing in AI-related initiatives as it sees "a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity," according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. The move makes HP the latest tech company to announce layoffs despite business looking solid in its latest quarter, highlighting what could be growing trend. A number of tech giants, including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), have also undertaken layoffs in recent months, while ramping up their AI efforts. The flurry of recent layoffs could point to growing pressure on tech companies to make cuts where they can to help support their spending on AI, while some may be expecting the technology could reduce the need for some roles over time. HP reported better revenue than expected at $14.6 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter. Its adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 was also slightly above analysts' expectations compiled by Visible Alpha. The company's profit outlook of $2.90 to $3.20 in EPS for fiscal 2026, however, came in below the analyst consensus. HP shares were down about 2% in recent trading, bring their year-to-date losses close to 27%.

Title: A.I. Leaders Warn Entry-Level White-Collar Jobs Are Being Automated Away

The technology industry, once a landing pad for fresh computer science graduates, is rapidly automating away its early-career talent pipeline. A.I. coding tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer now handle much of the entry-level work junior engineers once did, making it increasingly difficult for young professionals to break in.

You can opt out anytime. The impact isn’t limited to computer engineers. Earlier this month, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei offered a stark prediction on 60 Minutes, reiterating his belief that A.I. could replace half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years and push unemployment as high as 10 to 20 percent. “If we look at entry-level consultants, lawyers, financial professionals—a lot of what they do, A.I. models are already quite good at,” he said. “It’s hard to imagine that there won’t be some significant job impact there.” Other A.I. and business leaders have echoed his concerns. Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of A.I.,” has argued that “for mundane intellectual labour, A.I. is just going to replace everybody.” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said A.I. already performs “close to half” of the company’s workload. Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that “A.I. will leave a lot of white-collar people behind,” though he is more optimistic about blue-collar roles. He expects skilled workers in factories to become even more essential, as they provide “critically human support” in the context of automation. Several major studies support this trajectory. An August Goldman Sachs report warned that 6 to 7 percent of U.S. workers could lose jobs to A.I., particularly operational and support staff at large companies. Entry-level workers in tech remain the most affected, but hiring has also slowed in marketing, consulting, graphic design, office administration and call centers as businesses integrate new automation tools. A World Economic Forum study in January found that 41 percent of 1,000 surveyed global employers anticipate significant layoffs due to A.I. adoption. A recent Stanford study found that workers ages 22 to 25 in A.I.-exposed roles, especially in customer service and clerical work, have experienced a 13 percent decline in employment since 2022. In contrast, older workers in the same fields have had an easier time finding jobs. Other research suggests the downturn isn’t driven by A.I. alone. Negative perceptions of Gen Z employees and broader economic uncertainty are also factors. A study from Hult International Business School found that 89 percent of employers avoid hiring new college graduates, and 39 percent would prefer to use A.I. over hiring a Gen Z worker. Even so, companies are not uniformly shrinking their workforces. Some are restructuring instead—cutting traditional roles while adding new A.I.-specific ones. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said the bank’s overall headcount will continue to grow as it hires workers to support A.I. development, despite reductions in operational positions. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon voiced a similar view at an event in September, saying, “It’s very clear that A.I. is going to change literally every job.” Walmart, he said, will both eliminate and create roles, with the aim of helping employees “make it to the other side.” Ironically, while A.I. tools have increased the speed at which code can be generated, the durability of that code still depends on human expertise. A.I.-written code can be clumsy or brittle, and when complex systems break, engineers must know how to repair and refine them. Experienced engineers will still be needed to oversee A.I. systems, but even those roles could diminish, Amodei warned. “Eventually, all those little islands will get picked off by A.I. systems,” he said on 60 Minutes. “And then, we will eventually reach the point where the A.I.s can do everything that humans can. And I think that will happen in every industry.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: HP Joins List of Tech Companies Cutting Jobs and Pointing to AI

Reading time 3 minutes Computer maker HP is joining the growing list of companies that are conveniently announcing company-wide AI initiatives and plans to cut thousands of jobs at the same time. HP shared on Tuesday that it expects to scale artificial intelligence within the company and lay off about 4,000-6,000 employees by the end of 2028. With roughly 56,000 employees, that comes up to a 10% workforce reduction. âLooking forward, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate recent cost headwinds and are investing in AI-enabled initiatives to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity,” HP CFO Karen Parkhill said in the press release. Per the Guardian, the cuts will be centered around the product development, internal operations, and customer support teams. It’s safe to say that 2025 has so far been dominated by the question of whether or not AI is leading to mass unemployment. The job market is grim. Companies are cutting back on hiring new employees, while some are laying off hundreds to make investors happy in the next earnings report. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in September that although there is still great uncertainty, he believes that AI is “probably a factor” in the dramatic slowdown in hiring, particularly when it comes to young graduates who are facing a particularly concerning unemployment situation. There have been studies to back this phenomenon up as well. A Stanford study from August found that workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed jobs were hit hardest by a decline in employment. Many deem the jobs that are easiest to automate are those that would be done by young graduates. Experts have voiced concerns over the impact this will have on society as a whole, as less early career work would mean that the next generation of the workforce won’t receive crucial training. Even without the studies, companies have been openly and even proudly pointing the finger at AI as the reason why they are laying people off or just not hiring as much. Online learning platform Chegg laid off 45% of its workforce recently, citing “new realities of AI” as a factor. Amazon slashed 14,000 white-collar jobs, first seemingly pointing the finger at the “transformative technology” of AI before claiming days later that the cuts were not financially nor AI-driven. Many executives, like Shopify CEO Tobias LÃ¼tke and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn, have also been clear about their wish to reduce hiring in favor of automation. PwC global chairman told BBC last week that the company had scrapped plans it made in 2021 to hire 100,000 people by 2026, because “now we have artificial intelligence.” Still, though, some experts dispute that premise. âItâs much harder to implement AI in a firm than people realize,â Robert Seamans, New York University professor of management and organizations, told Gizmodo in August. âFirms donât typically have the in-house talent thatâs needed to train, operate, and oversee whatever AI they implement, and so until you have the personnel in place that have that expertise, itâs going to be really hard to rely heavily on AI.â An MIT report from August can back this up: corporate AI pilots are not as good as they seem at generating actual revenue gains. Seamans believes that at least some of these companies are actually using AI as a scapegoat for layoffs that stem from things like economic uncertainty or tariffs, which are “much harder to blame.” Meanwhile, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar called the “all-powerful-AI-taking-over-jobs” narrative a Silicon Valley “fundraising shtick,” in a recent conversation with the New York Times. Author Cory Doctorow, on the other hand, thinks that AI is unable to successfully replace many workers but bosses, and specifically tech bosses, “love the story” as a means to terrify workers into working more and complaining less (since, hypothetically, an AI chatbot could do all that work and not have to take breaks). “It gives them a chance to put them in their place,” Doctorow said in a talk last month.

Is Google's TPU a threat to Nvidia's dominance? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia released a statement saying that it’s “delighted by Google’s success,” but said that it continues to supply AI chips to the company. The AI giant made the X post in an apparent response to the news that Meta is in talks with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026 and then to purchase them the following year. This news resulted in an increase in stock prices for Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Meta, but also saw Nvidia take a 3% hit, especially as the market probably saw this as a break on the AI giant’s monopoly on the AI chip market. We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done," the company said on X via its Nvidia Newsroom account. "Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." Google's Cloud TPUs are ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — designed for AI workloads like training and inference. On the other hand, Nvidia's AI GPUs are general-purpose machines designed for parallel processing that have been repurposed for AI workloads. Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs are indeed superior to almost anything else on the market, especially in terms of versatility. Although they're primarily advertised for AI applications, they can also be used for high-performance computing, data analytics, graphics rendering and visualization, and many more. On the other hand, Google's TPUs are designed for matrix multiplication — the arithmetic operation that primarily runs most modern AI. This means that you cannot easily repurpose these chips for other purposes. However, it also gives them an advantage in AI processing, even sometimes giving them an advantage in AI workloads, especially in terms of efficiency. Meta isn't the first company to consider using Google TPUs for its AI operations. In fact, Anthropic has been using it since 2023, and the company has signed a deal to expand its contracted capacity to 1GW in 2026. But the biggest challenge for Google is the widespread adoption of its TPU chips, especially given Nvidia's huge market share. More than that, its CUDA platform is widely used in the industry, making it harder for developers to switch to Google's alternatives. However, the size of the proposed deal between Meta and Google appears large enough to threaten Nvidia's dominance in the market. While it would still be a drop in the bucket compared to Nvidia's skyrocketing revenues, it would at least show potential clients that there's a viable alternative to Team Green's GPUs. Just this thought is enough to send Nvidia's stock price sliding, and it comes so soon after the company's record highs, leading CEO Jensen Huang to say the market does not appreciate the AI GPU manufacturer.

Title: How Much Nostalgia Can an MMORPG Franchise Sustain?

Nostalgia can be a powerful influence on people. We all seem to have within us to desire to go back to some illusory “simpler time” when everything was better, more fun, less stressful, and didn’t cost so damn much. The problem is that only one of those items is consistently correct. That doesn’t stop businesses from preying on that desire to turn back the clock, though sometimes it is we, the customers, who end up banging on the door begging to be preyed upon. I think my earliest direct experience with this was Coca-Cola Classic. A registered trade mark of the Coca-Cola Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia Coke, having secured domination of the cola market, was now involved in the “cola wars” where Pepsi, pretender to the cola throne, was doing all it could to chip away and Coke’s market share. For some reason, Coke lost their minds and reformulated Coke to be more like Pepsi, thinking this would put Pepsi in it place. And so we got New Coke, which will live forever in business texts as an example of bad ideas. Coke, seeing their market share drop on the move, introduced Coca-Cola Classic. This set off a mild wave of nostalgia, as the company framed it that way, and we all ran to this new version of Coke and, for a brief time, Coke had even more market share with New Coke and Classic running in parallel. Then most people just picked Classic, sales of New Coke tanked, it was removed from the market, and we were back to just on core version of Coke. After that the company mostly ignore Pepsi and Pepsi scaled back their own costly assault on Coke somewhere around Crystal Pepsi and now we just have flavored versions of either as our variation. Not the last time I would see a nostalgia play, nor a nostalgia play that wore itself out as it simply became the new normal. In particular, for this discussion, there are MMORPGs that seem to rely pretty heavily on nostalgia after a certain point in their life cycle. EverQuest springs pretty readily to mind on that front. The game, coming up on its 27th year in a few months, took its first dip into the nostalgia pool 20 years ago, rolling out the first of what would become a long line of servers promising something akin to the first day experience. But it isn’t just the special servers that try to create a vision of the original. The expansions on the main servers… the “live” servers in EQ parlance, which translated to “retail” over in Azeroth… start to go back to old favorite locations in an attempt to capture a bit of that nostalgia magic. This same thing has been going on with World of Warcraft as well. In fact, Blizz was a little late to the party, taking 15 years to get there when titles that launched after WoW had been there already. But when Blizz finally got there, WoW Classic was a rousing success. It might even be considered a critical moment for the franchise as WoW Classic arrived just in time to save the game… financially at least… from the huge fumble that was the Shadowlands expansion on the retail side of the house. I am probably projecting my personal experience when I say Shadowlands broke the connection with retail for some… but the success of WoW Classic in that moment sealed it as a permanent fixture on the WoW agenda. The problem is that nostalgia is somewhat predicated on that past happy/better/ideal time being unavailable or unreachable. The whole point is that it is something in your personal story that you can no longer do. But what happens when that old experience is suddenly readily available again? What if you know that every spring the EQ team is going to roll out some minor variation on a fresh start, special rules, classic server. What happens when every expansion is going back to some old location? Or, on the WoW side of the street, what happens when you don’t understand that progress in old content is extremely accelerated so you let old expansions sit on the classic server long past their freshness date? What happens when your classic team’s monetization goals mean selling conveniences that were never in the original? What happens when you try to solve the “freshness” problem of old content by just cranking the difficulty dial one way or another while dumping modern features on top of the old content? And WHAT THE HELL happens when your retail team just gives up once and for all on being able to create two years of new content and decides that THEY TOO are going to spend the back stretch of every expansion cycle ALSO running old content, undermining the classic team’s efforts? You want Turtle WoW becoming a thing? This is how you get Turtle WoW becoming a thing! You make everything a blend of classic and suddenly it feels like a beige sameness. The spell is broken and people then want something new to try and reach that classic high. “New Classic” is an oxymoron, yes, but people are complicated and can hold conflicting beliefs. Sure, for a while there, I thought maybe Holly Longdale had unlocked the fountain of eternal youth with classic. But when classic content becomes pervasive, it is no longer classic. There can be no nostalgia when the old version is served up to you constantly… or, rather, nostalgia is defeated when things have changed so much… Dan Olson has a whole side riff on how much different it is to play WoW Classic on modern computers in his Why it’s Rude to Suck at WoW video… that you go there thinking you’ll feel the way you did, and it doesn’t happen. Or it no longer happens. For the first year or so of WoW Classic, it felt enough like the old days and Blizz hadn’t gotten concerned and started modernizing the old experience that I could squint my eyes and get a modest hit of “the good old days” from the game. But like all nostalgia, it is a very perishable product. I didn’t go play Anniversary Classic because it was too soon. The first time only worked because it had been so long since that original content had been playable outside of an emulator that is was great and there were crowds of people and we were all just so happy to be there. Until we weren’t. Now our group is off playing something else. We did WoW Classic and it was good, but even the most powerful nostalgia cannot fix what was broken in the first place. So it was an incredible high in vanilla, followed by a low in Outland… which I didn’t really like back in the day and was also the point when Blizz decided they really needed to monetize this classic stuff more… had a rebound in Northrend, and then died in the cataclysm, just like it did the first time around. I guess full points for recreating the original experience, but also I am no longer a subscriber. And EQ has it even worse. They’ve been putting out the special server thing for so long now that it is no longer special. There seems to be no setting of the dials that they have easy access to that will excite their installed base, and keeping them engaged is a critical part of their own business plan, a plan that wasn’t going so well at the last report, to the extent that EG7’s largest shareholder, Eros Capital Partners, has a list of demands including a new board of directors, more stock buybacks to bolster the share price, and maybe even bringing the whole place private again so they can loot the company without the watchful eye of regulators getting involved. What do you do when the nostalgia well runs dry? Yes, this is where we get to Classic Plus and like dreams. The problem is that the EverQuest team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to work on a new content creation path for the company’s foundational title. And if things continue to decline for EQ, they are likely going to have to make do with an even smaller team. Meanwhile, the World of Warcraft team could almost certainly find the staff to do something along those lines. Season of Discovery proved they could change up at least some of the vanilla experience. But my outsider opinion, having watched them for so many years, is that there is no internal champion capable of driving such a project. They always had the public company problem when Bobby Kotick was running the show, but they now have that in spades with Phil and Satya so obviously willing to slash and burn the second their bonuses might be in jeopardy. This is where Old School RuneScape is the outlier. Jagex has had a horrible time trying to develop another title. It feels like RuneScape is all the magic they had in them. But when they too went to the nostalgia well, they somehow found it within themselves to create a new path forward, different from RuneScape’s, to follow. This again, however, points out the hollow nature of nostalgia as a business plan. People want to “feel” like they did back in the day, but in the attempt they often find that simply going back to a game in their current state of mind will not fulfill that need. In the end, even Old School RuneScape failed the nostalgia test in the end. In going back to that, the players who embraced the old style of play quickly settled in and it became normal. It was Coca-Cola Classic just becoming Coke for that group. To keep them engaged, there had to be more, a hook, something fresh to keep those players happy. Nostalgia is a gimmick. A tease. A hook to grab attention. But Nostalgia alone is not sustainable, in part because we have all moved on from those times. We are different people in a changed world and the context that made something great at one moment leaves it feeling hollow now. For my final example, just to seal the deal on that idea, I am going to fall back to the Atari 2600. As I wrote years back, I wanted that more than anything in the world back in 1977. And I played the hell out of that console once I had it. But it doesn’t interest me today despite whatever investment group that holds the Atari name tries to tempt me with. That is a console that has been beaten to death when it comes to nostalgia. The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977. There has been no point in time since the mid-90s when I could not have bought a software version or a reworked, cost reduced, hardware copy of the original, to the point that I wonder who is left to even purchase such a thing. Then again, I suppose they wouldn’t keep remaking if nobody was buying them. But they always seem to show up around the holidays, when nostalgia is often at its peak and many adults are internally struggling with the fact that none of it is as much fun as when they were a kid. And then they see a stack of the latest round of 2600 remakes sitting on a pallet at Costco, and they cave to the temptation in their state of weakness. I mean, I know better and it almost works on me every year… almost. Yeah, I love that Dan Olsen video. His comment about going back and betting on the Cubs in 2016 and smashing in high school when you had the chance as a way to relive your past really hits home, because it also highlights just how far away that I am from my own high school experience for 2016 to be about my kids’ high school experience. (If my kids did smash when they got the chance back in high school, I think I’m happy with not knowing.) Still, Dan was right in that you really can’t go home again, and my form of rebellion in Wrath Classic was to simply refuse to get on the treadmill and do all the things I never got to do back in 2009-2010. I suppose in my own way I was deliberately choosing to suck at Warcraft as a big middle finger to the Classic Community. As far as the Atari (and other classic 8-bit systems) goes, I still have a working console in the basement, along with an Intellivision. (I have NO idea if the TI-99 4/A still works, as I haven’t powered it on in 30 years, but it probably does.) The one thing that keeps me from playing them is adapting them to fit a modern television. I’ve done some investigations from time to time, but the solutions commonly found on Amazon don’t exactly thrill me (I don’t trust the companies behind them when I can’t find any information about them online.) I may have to build something myself, or at the very least degauss the RCA CRT television we still have loitering around to get it up and running. LikeLike My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new. It gets harder and harder to find anything in just about any medium to which my immediate, unfiltered reaction isn’t “Oh, that reminds me of…” or even worse “Oh, that’s exactly like…”. I do still get a buzz out of revisiting old things but nowadays even that usually means old things I missed when they were new. New-to-me is the baseline of what makes me excited now. That’s why I’m a lot more interested in the upcoming EQII expansion, even though it will really just be more of the same, than I will be in whatever retro-server they try to drum up fading interest for next summer. At least the expansion will look new, even if it plays exactly the same. I do think Darkpaw is about done with the TLE server trick, though. They’ve made it last way longer than it had any right to so they can hardly complain but it can’t go on forever. EG7/DBG really need to come up with a new idea for the EQ IP soon, even if a whole new game is beyond them at this point. Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike (Re-posting this comment because the first just vanished. Please delete as necessary!)

Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike I truly delighted in WoW the first time around. it was all new to me, it was progress, it was definitely Wow. By the time they began messing with it, the game had shifted, and you were no longer in control of where you could go; the fights were easier, or non existent, and your trips ‘back home’ were stunningly sad. There was no back home. The story line changed, and the challenges that went with discovery the first time were now yawn inducing ‘oh yeah, I remember this” events. This, to me, is where WoW failed. It told the truth. You can’t go home again, because someone else lives there, the neighbors are gone, and that neat tree in the backyard has been replaced with a horse stall. Even when you know (or think you do) what’s around the bend, you’re braced for one event, only to face a different one. No more challenges. LikeLike I would really like a can of Crystal Pepsi for nostalgia’s sake, now that you’ve reminded me. The sensation I had when I tried it for the first (and, I believe only) time was very fascinating. My brain was like “Aaaaaahhhh, it looks like soda, but smells and tastes like Pepsi, what the hell is going on???” Of course, as with almost all kinds of nostalgia, that, too, would probably get old pretty fast. LikeLike I am far from immune to nostalgia, but the surprising thing to me about WoW Classic was how actually good a game it was back then. Rough edges, sure, but mostly quibbles. Nostalgia brought me to the party, the quality kept me there. But one can only play a given game so much before anything gets old. I hope for their sake they aren’t shifting the same diminishing player base around but actually bringing some new blood still. No amount of remixing will help if that isn’t the case. LikeLike I used to get frustrated with revisiting things because nothing ever seemed right or fun until I realized that it was me. I came to the conclusion that nostalgia is just me wanting to be a tourist among my past memories. That trying to live in the past is just going to be a disappointment/disaster. Once I understood that about myself I found I could have fun with nostalgic things. As far as gaming nostalgia goes, while I never played EQ (or EQ 2) in any serious fashion it has been fun to talk to and read people’s reactions about the progression servers. I get a sense that having a steady stream of them works well because there is enough people that like to drop in and experience the way things were for a time. After they get their fill they generally move on and and a new casual group starts up with the next server. With Wow I’m waiting until they feel the need to have a Chromie time version of Classic available for leveling in Retail. They’ve made a few steps towards making things from Classic available again in Retail, but that deep, rich vein of making all of Classic doable with Retail systems is waiting for them to break the glass. LikeLike Nostalgia is brain poison for old people. I have very fond memories of the blizzard of (Jan) 1996, of doing snow angels in the snow in front of the apartment bldg with my new wife. Great memory, full of joy. Good times, right? But I also remember that back then we were pretty poor, recently out of college, with debt and living in the cheapest neighborhood we could find. I have a very unpleasant memory of sitting down one time with $4.75, all we had, and budgeting it out to last three days til payday. Right down to how many subway tokens we needed and what ramen and cans of food we could get at the bodega. The walk to the train was so dicey at night I’d walk my wife there (night shift) and then go home and collapse into bed (day shift for me). In other words, it actually kind of sucked back then. I watched Halloween a few years ago and couldn’t believe how bad it was. It was one of my favorite movies when I was young. The acting, especially the dialogue, is so bad it sounds like a fourth grade play. If it wasn’t for the fame and “nostalgia” it would be unwatchable. I went to one of those arcade-bars a few years ago. So cool, you can play all these games while having access to the bar! And now I’m older, so I can afford to play any game(s) I want! You can guess what happened. You play Space Invaders, Asteroids, etc., a few times, and realize they’re kind of primitive and boring and only good for a day full of fun if current technology presents nothing better and you’re a kid with less options than an adult. The entire array of games held my attention for about 30 minutes and then it was just another bar. Brain poison. LikeLike “The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977.” Oh, yes. As far as MMO nostalgia goes, you can go back to the old content, but you can’t go back to the you that had no idea what was going on. LikeLike In a real sense it’s like rereading a book, or rewatching an old film or TV show. I can never be the young me discovering Tolkien for the first time. I can still read LotR as the much older me because I find ways of still enjoying it. Like I can play *insert old game* quite merrily, but I approach it very differently now to then. To get value now I have to remember I’m in the back half of my forties. As Tips says, you can’t go back to the old you; but as Pallais says you can (or I can) sometimes frame things that accounts for that and allows one to enjoy the nostalgia. LikeLike That is a distinction I could have made more clear, because the other direction, the “everything old is bad, newer is always better” idea is flawed in its own way. A lifetime in Silicon Valley has proven that. I still play a lot of older games because they were good. WoW Classic was a lot of fun as a game, even absent the nostalgia aspect. There is probably a whole post to be written (again) about how expansions are an attempt to keep the party going that can wear things thin while stealing fun from the original.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Big-Yield Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © jittawit21 / Shutterstock.com How can you leverage your savings into a more secure financial future? Dividends can be a key component of your wealth-building plan, and you can start today by investing just $2,500 per asset into five stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). When all is said and done, it might even be possible to take a $12,500 total investment ($2,500 times five different stocks/ETFs) and parlay it into $4,000 in annual passive income. The formula for success is to buy a couple of high-yield dividend stocks and then add several ETFs to raise your overall yield even further. In order to get $4,000 in annual dividends/distributions from a $12,500 total investment, you’ll need to achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 divided by $12,500, or 32%. That’s a high yield target, so let’s start off with a pair of ambitious income-generating stock picks. To begin, you could allocate $2,500 into shares of Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:CHMI). This firm is a real estate finance company that specializes in U.S.-based residential mortgage assets. Before we look at the dividend yield, we should make sure that Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. is income-positive so that the company can afford to pay its dividends. Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. appears to check that box, as it reported GAAP net income applicable to common stockholders of around $2 million in 2025’s third quarter. Will CHMI stock help you reach your goal of a 32% average annual yield, though? Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. offers a 23.91% forward annual dividend yield, which falls short of 32% but is still quite high. So now, let’s reveal our second individual stock pick for a $2,500 investment. This firm happens to be a leader in an important market sector. Founded in Israel but global in operations, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM) is a well-established container liner shipping company. Turning to the topic of financials, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services recorded $123 million worth of third-quarter 2025 net income. In other words, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services is income-positive and ought to be able to pay its dividends for a while, at least. Furthermore, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services pays a forward annual divided yield of 21.94%, which is nothing to sneeze at. We’re still below our target average yield of 32%, but now we can catch up with some giant-yield ETFs. When I’m falling behind and want to rapidly ramp up my total returns, I can turn to YieldMax’s high-paying ETFs. The following YieldMax funds utilize options-trading strategies, possibly including writing covered call options and creating synthetic option positions, to generate weekly cash distributions for investors. Kicking off our three-pack of YieldMax funds is the YieldMax AAPL Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY). This ETF creates weekly income opportunities by deploying options-trading strategies based on the price movements of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. There’s no doubt that Apple is income-positive, so we don’t need to debate that issue. And while the APLY ETF’s share price may be volatile sometimes, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income ETF offers an outstanding 41.76% expected annual distribution rate. Pressing forward, our second ETF selection is the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:BABO). Although BABO uses similar options-trading strategies to APLY, the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF focuses on Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock instead of Apple stock. Because Alibaba is a multinational e-commerce leader, the risk level may be mitigated somewhat with the YieldMax BABA Option Income ETF. In any case, the BABO ETF advertises a 51.55% annual distribution rate, so we’re definitely getting closer to achieving our objective of $4,000 in yearly passive income. The last piece of the puzzle will be another weekly-paying fund, the YieldMax JPM Option Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO). This one, as you surely surmised, utilizes options-trading strategies to extract income from the price action of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock. It cannot be denied that JPMorgan Chase is a financially sound business, and this should provide some confidence if you’re investing $2,500 in the JPMO ETF. Plus, impressively, the YieldMax JPM Option Income ETF carries a 47.65% anticipated annual distribution rate. So, what might you get if you invest $2,500 each into CHMI, ZIM, APLY, BABO, and JPMO? We can find the answer simply by adding the yields up and then dividing the sum by five. I won’t keep you in suspense any longer. If the yields of these assets aren’t reduced, then you ought to achieve an average annual dividend/distribution yield of 37.36%. Thus, we have exceeded our 32% yield target and should be able to generate $4,000 per year from a $12,500 total investment. Your role, then, is to conduct your due diligence and consider starting on your journey to massive passive income today.

Investing JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting that the dip is an opportunity. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. It’s always a good idea to keep track of analysts’ stock upgrades. Often, they’re influenced by (1) company fundamentals, such as financial health, future growth, and even meetings with management; (2) industry and market trends, including specific market conditions and economics; (3) earnings and financial data, including earnings reports that came in better than expected, or competitive analysis of a competitor, and (4) guidance. However, before jumping into a stock just because your favorite analyst upgraded it, do your own due diligence, fundamentally and technically. That being said, here are a few heavy-hitters seeing upgrades. JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The firm says the dip is an opportunity, noting that shares re-traced to pre-earnings levels and are now about 10% off November highs. Just yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Not long ago, analysts at KeyBanc Capital said Amazon should benefit from the AI boom. The analysts say Amazon’s AWS is still growing strong. It also believes that the ramp of gigawatt data center clusters and customers like Anthropic are potential drivers of revenue acceleration into 2026. The analysts have an overweight rating on AMZN with a $300 price target. Heading into earnings next week, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) just saw a price target hike from Goldman Sachs. With a new target of $435, up from $380, the firm expects to see further sustained strength in artificial intelligence. It also expects to see updated 2026 AI revenue guidance above 100% year-over-year. “The analyst sees AI revenue for fiscal year 2026 to come in at $45.4 billion, marking an approximate year-over-year rise of 128%. This could reach $77.3 billion in 2027, rising 70% year over year,” added CNBC. Analysts at Raymond James also resumed their outperform rating on Broadcom. With a price target of $420 a share, the firm “cited Broadcom’s position as a share gainer in the AI sector, providing operators with customized alternatives to general-purpose processors. Raymond James expects continued upward estimate revisions to support its positive rating on the stock,” as noted by Investing.com. Analysts at Piper Sandler upgraded Oscar Health (NYSE: OSCR) to an overweight rating with a price target of $25 from $13. The firm noted that with enhanced premium tax credits (E-APTCs) expiring at the end of the year, OSCR’s market share and margins should expand. “If the E-APTCs are allowed to expire at the end of CY25, OSCR believes Individual ACA Marketplace enrollment could decline (20.0%) to (30.0%) in CY26. This projection implies that the Individual ACA Market sheds ~6.1M lives y/y; with enrollment collapsing from ~24.3M in CY25 to ~18.2M in CY26,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “It reflects the confluence of expiring E-APTCs and federal efforts to strengthen program integrity.” Latest Podcast Episode Amazon Strikes Back, And A Surprise $10,000 Portfolio Buy 38 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Nov 9, 2025 Live Nov 4, 2025 Analysts are doubling down on market leaders, with fresh upgrades for Nvidia, AMD, Walmart, Amazon, and Broadcom.

Full Content:
Oracle stock has fallen nearly 30% in a month as debt worries and AI-related uncertainty hit sentiment. The company has added tens of billions in new borrowing to fund rapid data-center expansion, lifting credit-default swap costs and widening spreads. Investors are also uneasy about Oracle’s $300 billion OpenAI cloud commitment, as questions grow about revenue timing and concentration risk. Analysts say ORCL looks oversold after breaking below the $200 level. Some see a buy-the-dip setup, but others warn debt, cash-flow pressure, and AI dependency may delay any recovery.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Black Friday has passed, but the deals continue all weekend into Cyber Monday, and there are lots to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated November 30: We have reviewed the best prices and found some of more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout the day and throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Black Friday Tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales we’ve noticed that on Amazon if you delay your delivery date there are additional 3% savings to be had in the U.S. (2% in the U.K.)! This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart then it can add up to a decent saving. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $274, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

This undated combination of photos shows clockwise from top left the company logos for Amazon, Target, Lufthansa Group, UPS, ConocoPhillips, Intel, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Nestle. (AP Photo, file) NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from U.S. President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released last week, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. The shutdown also resulted in holes for more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, HP said this week it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year. Also in November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors will lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said in October that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October said it would eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Nvidia CEO Says You’re “Insane” If You Don’t Use AI to Do Literally Everything

By Frank Landymore Published Nov 26, 2025 9:16 AM EST Don’t use AI to do literally everything? You might want to get your head checked, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. At least, that’s reportedly how Huang feels about any Luddite employees who are still writing code the old-fashioned way. Fortune reports that at an all-hands meeting last week, which took place right after the company reported its “blowout” third quarter results, Huang torched his managers who are still telling their teams to hold back on AI usage — an idea that, to him, should call your psychological wellbeing into question. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI,” Huang said. “Are you insane?” “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence,” he demanded. “I promise you, you will have work to do.” It’s a hard line for Huang to be taking, considering that there’s still no consensus on whether AI tools, especially in coding tasks, actually make workers more productive. In fact, a certain body of evidence points to the contrary: one study found that programmers who used coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude used less than half of the AI’s suggestions, rendering them 19 percent slower compared to their colleagues who didn’t harness AI’s awesome powers of automation. Nonetheless, tech companies are speedrunning the process of getting high on their own supplies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed that as much as 25 percent of the company’s code is now AI-generated, and in June the company reportedly told staff that they were expected to use its Gemini model to write code going forward. The same story is playing out at Microsoft. CEO Satya Nadella similarly claims that over a quarter of the company’s code is written with AI, and as Fortune notes, echoed Google’s marching orders by telling its programmers this summer that using AI is “no longer optional.” Regardless of the quality of automation, the other big question is what does AI mean for programmers’ jobs? Tech layoffs have been brutal this year, with around 140,000 employees expected to be fired by year’s end. Amazon is in the middle of axing thousands of engineers as one of its top executives, in response to the harrowing reduction in personnel, gloats about how “transformative” AI is and the need to innovate. Huang, however, is telling employee with a straight face that embracing AI will be good for them — even as the leaders of companies that Nvidia is providing its Nvidia chips to, if not propping them up with billions of dollars of its own money, all warn that AI is, in fact, going to wipe out jobs. And so nevermind the widespread reports of AI chatbots literally causing people to be institutionalized — you’re the one who’s out of touch for refusing to fall in love with it.

Despite plenty of headlines about layoffs, American companies are not letting go of many workers. Americans filed 216,000 new applications for unemployment benefits last week, down 6,000 from the prior week and marking the lowest level since mid-April, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. The decline defied economists’ expectations for claims to rise to 225,000 and suggests companies remain reluctant to cut workers despite mounting economic headwinds and a string of high-profile layoff announcements. The number of Americans continuing to collect unemployment benefits edged up to 1.96 million for the week ended Nov. 15, hovering near levels last seen during the pandemic recovery. While initial filings remain relatively low by historical standards, the uptick in continuing claims points to a more challenging environment for job seekers trying to land new positions. The data paint a picture of a labor market in transition: Employers are pulling back sharply on hiring but haven’t yet resorted to widespread workforce reductions. Companies including HP, ConocoPhillips, General Motors, Paramount, Target, UPS, Verizon, and Amazon have announced plans to eliminate positions in recent weeks, though those cuts haven’t shown up meaningfully in unemployment statistics. The weekly claims figures can be volatile around holidays, and on an unadjusted basis, new applications jumped last week ahead of Thanksgiving. The four-week moving average, which smooths out such fluctuations, declined to 223,750. The labor market’s cooling has caught the attention of Federal Reserve officials, who cited employment concerns when cutting interest rates at their past two meetings. But policymakers are split on whether to deliver another rate reduction at their December gathering as they weigh persistent inflation against signs of labor-market softening. That uncertainty is filtering through to American workers. Consumer confidence dropped in November by the most in seven months, driven partly by dimmer views on employment prospects. A separate October survey found that 55 percent of employed Americans worry about losing their jobs, while nearly half believe it would take four months or longer to find comparable work if they were laid off. Continuing claims have trended higher since September, suggesting that while companies aren’t shedding workers en masse, those who do lose jobs are taking longer to find new ones, a shift from the rapid job-switching that characterized the pandemic-era labor market.

Title: Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks

Time Published: 2025-11-26T13:05:34Z

Walt Disney World fans have a lot of complaints and criticism for the company, and in a rare turn of events, the head of Imagineering agrees with them about one of the biggest problem points with the guest experience in the parks. Unfortunately, one of his proposed solutions isn’t going to be well received, but the first step is acknowledging there’s an issue. Frankly, we’re thankful to hear this. As we’ve covered in Top 10 Guest Complaints About Walt Disney World and other roundups of the biggest annual fan concerns about WDW, we’ve been receiving negative reader feedback at a far historically-high rate over the last 5 years. Essentially, since the honeymoon phase of the post-COVID reopening wore off and fans started realizing temporary changes were going to become permanent. The #4 entry on last year’s version of the biggest complaints list was “too much screen time.” Refreshing for better Lightning Lanes. Mobile Order for counter service restaurants and Merchandise Mobile Checkout to buy stuff. Checking Walk-up Waitlist for new table service availability. Looking at wait times and showtimes. And so on and so forth. It’s been our position that this is both an obvious issue and an overblown one. So many entries on the above list are entirely optional. You can opt-out of Lightning Lanes completely, there are cash registers for counter service restaurants and merchandise, ADRs can be made pre-trip, and wait times boards are throughout the park (if you even need them in the first place). On the other hand, optional might need air quotes around it. Ignore all of those app features to your own detriment, as they can help simplify and streamline your day. Not only that, but FOMO makes it difficult to opt-out of Lightning Lanes or anything else. The compulsion to check the My Disney Experience app is a direct result of the deliberate choices that Walt Disney World has made. For years, we’ve said that Walt Disney World leans too heavily on technology (ironic, since Disney is objectively awful at it) and not enough on tactile experiences. To paraphrase my favorite Walt Disney quote, “it’s people that make the dream a reality.” The best memories are formed as a result of interpersonal moments, and so much emotional resonance is derived from guests connecting with others. Even if people can’t put their finger on it, so much of what differentiates and defines the appeal of Walt Disney World is the ‘little things’ that bring them together with each other and shared spaces. Big new rides get people to take the trip, but it’s the myriad little things and those connections that convince them to return. Then, of course, there are the themed environments that Imagineering worked so hard to create. By having their faces buried in their phones while in line or strolling through the park, guests are missing so much of the defining features of Walt Disney World. It’s not just about racing from ride to ride and accomplishing those, checklist-style, with the shortest wait times possible. It’s the spaces in between–the breathing room and richly themed environments–that make Disney, Disney. If guests are overlooking that, they’re missing a lot of what separates Walt Disney World from regional parks. Walt Disney World now nudges guests towards spending way too much time with their faces buried in their phones. These new app features are great in isolation, and benefit the company by improving efficiency and cutting costs. However, the totality of all of this amounts to Walt Disney World effectively leaning into its biggest weaknesses (technology and isolation) and away from its strengths (richly themed environments and togetherness). It might look good in the quarterly financials, but all of this technology does come with a long-term cost. And now, it would seem that someone high-up in the company actually agrees with the spirit of this sentiment… Walt Disney Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn commented on exactly this issue, and how phones inhibit the guest experience in the parks. Here’s what he said: Extended reality is gonna reinforce the shared experience. A big differentiator for us is that you’re there together with friends and family and people that you care about, and every time you look have to look down at a device or a phone, it breaks that spell. If you can use extended reality, I never stop looking at the environment I’m in or at the people I’m with, it’s gonna be less disruptive. Asa Kalama, Executive Creative Director at Walt Disney Imagineering, spoke about the possibilities of the new partnership with Disney, Meta and Ray-Ban. We have a really wonderful partnership with Meta to leverage their Ray-Ban smart glasses for both guest-facing applications and also behind the scenes design applications as well. What’s great about these glasses is they’ve got cameras in them, microphones, and speakers. For guests, it allows us to put a virtual theme park guide in their ear. The glasses can enhance the ways we tell stories for our guests, unlocking a world of information about the land that they’re in. Just by looking around, I can ask questions about some of the architectural details, and I get the answer right in my ear. Maybe I wanna learn a little bit more about a merchandise item for my child. All I have to do is look at it, ask, “tell me more information about it.” Then, right in my ear, I get all of the product information. Kalama later added: “if we’re doing our jobs properly, all of the technology goes away and our guests get immersed in the story we’re trying to tell.” Another Imagineer was quick to say that Disney “is not just using technology for technology’s sake.” Instead, Disney is using technology “in service of story” they’re trying to tell. This is great sentiment, and I absolutely agree with it. The only problem is that I’ve been a Disney Adult for two decades now, and I’ve seen countless examples of the technological tail wagging the dog in the parks. Things like the entire NextGen initiative to Made with Magic/Glow with the Show to Genie and more. There are countless examples of abandoned technology that the company invested big bucks into, seemingly failing to take into account whether it was something guests would actually embrace. Vaughn and Kalama were just two of the Imagineers who covered this and adjacent topics as part of the new ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode of the “We Call it Imagineering” YouTube series. During that, Disney shared an inside look at its once-secret internal R&D arm, while also highlighting prolific partnerships with tech companies including Nvidia, Google, and Meta. I want to start by saying that I’ve enjoyed every episode of “We Call It Imagineering,” but the ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode is the first one that really felt like it was aimed at two distinct audiences. There’s the fans, obviously, and we no doubt ate up this behind-the-scenes look at what Disney is doing with robotics. At the same time, a lot of this seemed to be aimed squarely at investors, as a part of Disney’s years-long quest to be viewed (and valued) as a technology company. Heck, they even got Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to say, “at the core, Disney is a technology company.” Wall Street’s favorite CEO said the thing! That’s gotta be worth at least a 2% boost to Disney’s share price!!! In all seriousness, I can’t imagine there are many (any?) diehard Disney fans who were on the edges of their seats waiting to hear Jensen Huang’s take on Imagineering. If you gave me 10,000 guesses as to who would be featured in this episode, I wouldn’t have picked him. And yet, from Disney’s perspective–since it’s serving multiple audiences with content like this–that was probably the most consequential portion of the episode. (One of my favorite writers, Matt Levine of Bloomberg, routinely writes about the circularity of AI deals. Those sometimes involve partnerships with Nvidia and the promise to purchase their chips. That’s not the nature of the Disney-Nvidia relationship, but it’s close enough that this video reminded me of it. Point being, AI is definitely not a bubble. Nothing to see here, folks, just some totally normal pumping of stock prices.) The Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses feel similarly. That this has been deemed a marquee corporate alliance for the Walt Disney Company (because Meta is a big deal), so they’re supposed to throw resources at it and tout it whenever possible. Honestly, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if Meta is underwriting all of the research & development that Disney is doing, and whatever the consumer product ends up being. There’s a tremendous amount of value to Meta in having trusted brands lend their goodwill to this product and normalize it, as Meta isn’t exactly a beloved American institution and this product isn’t something anyone asked for. So it’s going to take time and effort to reach a critical mass. If this is sounding familiar already, it’s because there’s overlap between the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses and Apple Vision Pro, which we discussed a couple of years ago when Disney announced a creative partnership for that product. I expressed skepticism at the time, just as I had done previously with Disney’s forays into the metaverse, Cinderella Castle Mural of Memories NFT, Prime-Style Membership Program, AI Task Force, and so on and so forth. What I wrote about Apple Vision Pro more or less applies to the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses. And I’ll be honest, I am openly hoping for both to fail so spectacularly that tech companies don’t try this nonsense again for another decade or two. For all of its promise and potential to bring us together, technology has done as much or more to isolate us. We walk around all day with our faces buried in screens; rather than chatting with strangers in face-to-face settings, we pick up our phones the moment there’s a brief lull in conversation. Our fixation with the virtual world has stressed the social fabric, and we are collectively worse for it–even as some aspects of our lives have unquestionably improved thanks to technology. Smart glasses obviously are less obtrusive than clunky Apple Vision Pro headsets. They nevertheless will isolate people from one another in public spaces if widely adopted and used in day-to-day life. If products like this become socially acceptable to wear and interact with in public, we will lose more of the small but meaningful interactions that make us human. That might sound hyperbolic, but the concerns are well-founded. This is precisely what the documentary “Her” was talking about. Disney and Meta can pretend that the future is a world where we’re freed from our screens and talking to an AI copilot as we interact with our family and friends, all while quickly learning about the world around us. Maybe they’re right! Perhaps that’s how it’ll happen. In my view, the more likely outcome is that this isolates people even further. That instead of talking to one another, striking up a conversation with fellow guests or asking questions of Cast Members, everyone retreats to their AI assistants to interact with. That we become less social with actual humans, siloing ourselves off because our agreeable AI companions are easier to talk to. Again, this might sound like doom and gloom. But does anyone actually think that social media made us more sociable? Or that any emerging technology in the last couple of decades has made us less, not more, addicted to devices? Do you truly believe that Meta wants you to spend less time using its products and more time immersed in reality? These trend lines are only going in one direction–at least, if the companies behind them have their ways. They can say otherwise, but they don’t exactly have strong track records with the truth. However, that comes with a very big “if.” Smart glasses are more likely to become socially acceptable to wear in public spaces than Apple Vision Pro (at least with its currently form factor). There’s no doubt about that. But that’s only because most people don’t realize you’re wearing them. I would imagine that it’d be a different story entirely if you got into a crowded queue and started asking questions to your sunglasses. As other guests start looking at you like you’re a crazy person, go ahead and try explaining that you’re talking to your “smart” sunglasses. See how well that goes over. Obviously, I don’t speak for the park-going public, but if I had such an interaction, I would move away from the person in question. Mostly because I don’t want to be in their field of view being watched over by Mark Zuckerberg. But partly because I have certain preconceived notions about someone who would carry on a conversation with their sunglasses. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I doubt it. If you already have these sunglasses and love them, more power to you. Perhaps you’re seeing the world in a new way; it’s worth acknowledging that the reverse might also be true. A decade ago, Google Glass learned precisely that lesson–that this kind of wearable was simply a bridge too far for average Americans. Google Glass was a spectacular failure, and the people who wore that nascent version of this tech were viewed as creeps and weirdos. But Meta and Ray-Ban are more mainstream, and perhaps partners like Disney will further normalize this type of wearable. Or maybe tech evangelists in Silicon Valley are truly disconnected from the rest of human civilization, unable to see beyond their own bubbles where products like this capture the imagination and are deemed the future of humanity. The majority of average Americans are weirded out by this type of thing, do not view it as the logical evolution of the smart device, and will never adopt it. While I don’t think there’s any putting the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the ubiquitousness of technology in society–nor should there be, as there are tangible benefits–I do think that people are becoming, and will continue to become, more cognizant of the dangers of living online and benefits of disconnecting. This is already happening. The first generation of kids exposed to social media and phones at young ages are now parents ourselves, and we’ve seen this firsthand. Phone-free schools are already increasingly common, but there’s a growing push to make schools screen-free entirely. And at least in our circle, most parents significantly limit screen time, or don’t allow it at all. This may seem beside the point, or to reinforce the desire for something like smart glasses, but it’s really not. The underlying sentiment is a skepticism about these tech companies and the addictiveness of their products. If you have any doubt about this, consider researching how tech executives restrict their own children’s use of these devices–or common policies around Silicon Valley school districts. It’s not just Millennial parents, the same trends are happening among younger people. Gen Z is more technologically literate than older generations, and they have a clearer view of these products and companies like Meta. And there’s certainly no reason to believe that older generations will be the early adopters of things like smart glasses, giving them the necessary market penetration. So who, exactly, is this for? What’s the path to it becoming as popular as the iPod or iPhone? It’s my fairly strong belief that there isn’t one. That the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will be the best-selling version of this product, but that it won’t have even 1% of the market penetration as the smart phone. And from that perspective alone, this is DOA as being the future of the theme park experience. This cannot be what ‘breaks the spell’ (I realize I’m using this differently than Vaughn, but I found his turn of phrase apt–albeit in a different direction) of guests being glued to their phones, as not enough guests will use it for it to make a meaningful difference. It’s like the notion that Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser, Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Datapad, Play Disney Parks, or any other past efforts at creating virtual worlds within the physical confines of Walt Disney World were the future of theme parks. An impossibility based on scale alone. Even with more charitable assumptions than I’m willing to make, it’s highly unlikely that there will ever be enough uptake for something like this to be what resolves the problem of excessive screen time. Perhaps Disney has been paid enough ZuckBucks and such a Walt Disney World application for the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will come to fruition, but it’ll only work for fewer than 5% of guests. And probably the ones least inclined to be on their phones less. Ultimately, I’m heartened that Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn recognizes that excessive screen time is a problem with the guest experience, and something that actively undercuts what his division creates. At the same time, I’m also unconvinced that he has any realistic solutions to address this, or that the powers that be view this as a bug as opposed to a feature. Given that, the most likely outcome is more technology as opposed to less, and the hope that some of that will somehow be a net positive for the parks…and humanity. I don’t like our odds.

Hearing your feedback–even when you disagree with us–is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! Weird and terrible idea – why would Disney partner with Meta? Kinda sullies the brand. My almost 11-year-old constantly asks me to get off my phone when we’re at the Disney parks. She hates that it takes me out of the moment. Often, I am trying to use my phone to make her experience more enjoyable (i.e., booking a ride or pre-ordering food to reduce waits for both), or to take pictures (we don’t have a camera otherwise)… but she’s right. 🙁 I wish Disney would go back to analog FastPass and such, but I know they never will. I know you don’t NEED to use tech at Disney, but I want to maximize our time and enjoyment. So, ass they continue to digitize the Disney experience or make it more difficult to enjoy offline, I will increasingly book trips like to places like national parks, Costa Rica and Hawaii, etc., where we can better unplug and enjoy our moments. Blaming Disney for low grade guest behavior with phones? You e GziT to be kidding. This type of “glued to the screen” abhorrent behavior is everywhere Disney did not invent it. If Disney didn’t have mobile apps for food service, mobile check-out and other services you’d bitch about that and say they aren’t keeping up with the times. Low class guest behavior is a people problem that will be difficult to improve. Some people just have no manners or class I don’t know how AI will end up working out for Disney, but the company always been relied on pioneering technology to enhance storytelling. Starting with synchronized sound in 1928, Disney has consistently pioneered technologies that transformed entertainment. The pattern: identify transformative technologies early, invest heavily to perfect them, and set industry standards competitors must follow. Steamboat Willie (1928) wasn’t the first sound cartoon, but it pioneered precise audio-visual synchronization. Flowers and Trees (1932) became the first three-color Technicolor cartoon after Disney secured an exclusive two-year deal, blocking competitors. The multiplane camera (1937), an 11-foot apparatus requiring 12 technicians, photographed up to seven artwork layers to create dimensional depth. It remained in use through The Little Mermaid (1989). Fantasound (1940) for Fantasia introduced the first commercial surround sound: 90 speakers per theater at $85,000 each. Disney invented click tracks, multi-track recording, overdubbing, and the “pan pot” for sound positioning, which are foundational audio technologies still used today. When Sleeping Beauty’s $6 million budget nearly bankrupted animation, Ub Iwerks adapted xerography to transfer drawings directly to celluloid, cutting production costs roughly in half. 101 Dalmatians (1961), impossible to hand-ink economically, became that year’s highest-grossing film. Disneyland (1955) brought technological innovations to theme parks. The 1959 Matterhorn Bobsleds pioneered tubular steel coaster design, enabling all modern steel coasters. Audio-Animatronics debuted in 1963 with the Enchanted Tiki Room’s 200+ synchronized figures; Pirates of the Caribbean (1967) deployed over 120 figures in what remains the paradigm of animatronic showmanship. Digital Graphics and Animation (1982-1995) TRON (1982) featured approximately 20 minutes of CGI — the first extensive use of computer-generated imagery in film. Though commercially unsuccessful, it inspired John Lasseter and the future Pixar team. The Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), developed with Pixar, replaced cel painting with digital ink and paint. The Rescuers Down Under (1990) became the first 100% digital feature film ever produced. CAPS enabled the CGI ballroom in Beauty and the Beast and the wildebeest stampede in The Lion King. Disney initially kept it secret, “afraid that the magic would go away if people found out computers were involved.” Strategic Acquisitions (2006-2017) Disney assembled technology capabilities through acquisition: Pixar ($7.4 billion, 2006) for animation excellence and technical leadership; Lucasfilm ($4.05 billion, 2012) for Industrial Light & Magic, holder of 16 Visual Effects Oscars; BAMTech ($3.8 billion total, 2016-2022) for streaming infrastructure built years before YouTube existed. MagicBand Revolution (2013-2014) The MagicBand represented Disney’s largest technology investment: over $1 billion. The RFID wristband consolidated park tickets, hotel keys, payments, and FastPass into a single wearable. Implementation required Wi-Fi across the entire resort and upgrading 28,000+ hotel room doors. It achieved 90% satisfaction ratings and won Fast Company’s 2014 “Innovation by Design” award — the largest successful launch of consumer wearable technology in a connected ecosystem. Virtual Production and Streaming (2019-Present) The Mandalorian (2019) debuted StageCraft — ILM’s virtual production system using a 270-degree LED video wall displaying real-time Unreal Engine environments. Over 50% of Season 1 was filmed using StageCraft, eliminating location shoots. Permanent volumes now operate worldwide. BAMTech infrastructure powered ESPN+ (2018) and Disney+ (2019). By August 2022, Disney Streaming reached 221 million total subscriptions. Recent Innovations (2019-2025) Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge deployed trackless ride systems, A-1000 Audio-Animatronics with 51 functions, and app-based interactive experiences. Stuntronics (autonomous aerial robots) power the Spider-Man at Avengers Campus, performing acrobatics 65+ feet in the air. BDX walking droids (2023) brought AI-enabled bipedal robots using reinforcement learning — the first Disney robots walking freely among guests. Disney’s $1.5 billion Epic Games investment (2024) aims to build a persistent virtual universe. The Office of Technology Enablement now coordinates AI initiatives across film, television, and theme parks. Disney repeatedly identified emerging technologies before competitors, synchronizing sound, color, stereophonic audio, computer graphics, digital streaming, virtual production, and AI. And the investments were made early, before it was clear the technology would pay off. The founding philosophy persists: technology serves storytelling. Each investment strengthens the connection between Disney stories and their audiences. Not all investments will pan out, but Disney has to keep trying or be left behind. I feel like I wanna save this to use as an essay someday hahahahahaha the documentary her Didn’t Disney JUST get rid of the glasses on Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure? And now they think people will want to use different glasses? Outside? Really? I suppose this could become an alternative to 3D glasses on Flight of Passage or Toy Story Mania…but that’s about it. Mom tells me to turn the phone on whenever I go out running errands or to a local restaurant (so she can contact me), but I always keep it off when I go to the theme parks. I boycott Lightning Lane because I think it’s an example of Disney greed & they should’ve stuck with free FastPasses. I’m not very technologically adept anyway & can’t even get my phone’s screen to cooperate with me to successfully type in a password when it keeps randomly switching between the letter, number, & symbol keyboards. Maybe if I could actually use a SmartPhone for more than calling home if I’m going to be late, I would be on the phone more often at the parks. But I’m glad I still enjoy being in the minute when I’m there. I rarely carried an old-fashioned camera with me for the same reasons. Labeling “Her” a documentary is the kind of thing that keeps me coming back, Tom. Your email address will not be published.

Title: This is the first year I can't find a holiday job
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kqw82j07o
Time Published: 2025-11-26T06:07:43Z

Nicholas Strahl has always been able to find extra work around the holidays. But this year has been the exception. Mr Strahl, 41, works as a part-time retail sales associate at an office supplies store just outside Indianapolis, Indiana. While the pay is "okay", he said it "never hurts to have a little bit more". Finding seasonal holiday employment, for extra cash to pay his bills and buy holiday gifts for friends and family, has been a challenge. He started his search in early October and applied to CVS, Best Buy and a slew of other retailers - to no avail. "I've never seen the job market like this - it's pretty crazy," he said. "It doesn't really leave a lot of power for people who just want to get a job, or have a supplement in income." Seasonal hiring is poised to drop to its lowest level since the aftermath of the 2008 recession, according to the National Retail Federation. The pullback, a sign of caution among US businesses in the face of tariffs and consumer angst, comes as more people are looking for work in the cooling job market. The industry group expects retailers to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from 442,000 last year. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which also predicted the weakest holiday season for retail hiring in more than 15 years, said tariffs, inflation and reliance on automation are dampening demand for seasonal hires. If Mr Strahl can't land a holiday job, he plans to cut down on holiday gifts and hold off on some car repairs. He will wait to replace his old laptop. "At this point," he said, "I'm willing to take anything I can get." Data from Indeed shows that while postings for seasonal work have largely held steady compared to last year, more people are seeking seasonal jobs. And in retail, traditionally one of the biggest hirers for the holidays, there are fewer opportunities. The labour market is "frozen with frostbite", said Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab. The fact that seasonal job postings have held steady from last year is reflective of the labour market's paralysis, she said. "You have a much bigger labour pool competing for a smaller number of jobs," she added. The government shutdown, which lasted more than one month before ending on 13 November, had delayed the release of official data on the labour market. But data for September, finally released last week, showed a surprising pick-up in hiring after a lacklustre summer. Employers added 119,000 jobs in September, more than double what many analysts had expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%. Data from Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence firm, shows job openings in the retail sector in October were down 22% from last year. The drop signals less demand among retailers for holiday workers. "We're just not seeing the usual pick-up in holiday hiring," said Lisa Simon, Revelio's chief economist. Several leading retailers, including Target and Walmart, have refrained from saying how many additional workers they will bring onto their payrolls for the holidays. Walmart may hire on a store-by-store basis, but extra hours during the holidays will mostly be given to current employees, a company spokesperson said. The lack of specificity marks a divergence from previous years, when the firms have announced their seasonal hiring plans in advance. In contrast, Amazon says it will hire the same number of people in its fulfilment and transportation network as it has over the past two years. "The cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge," Andy Challenger, senior vice president of sales at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. It follows recent high-profile layoffs at big US companies, including in the retail sector. Some smaller retailers are also treading carefully as they head into the holidays, further limiting options for job hunters to find roles at local shops. For Hobby Works, a chain of two toy stores in Maryland, pressure from tariff costs and whiplash on economic policy this year has been compounded in recent weeks by the federal government shutdown. Located just outside Washington, the company, which employs 24 people, pushed back its usual timeline for hiring seasonal workers, president Michael Brey said. Concern about a pullback in spending among government workers, who found themselves without pay for more than a month before the shutdown ended, encouraged the store to cut costs by scaling back hiring, he said. "Hanukkah always happens, Christmas always comes, so we try not to alter our hiring patterns too much," Mr Brey said. "But this is the first year we're moving very slowly." Two years ago, Tanya Secord sailed her way through the application process to land a temporary job at Target, where she worked as a part-time cashier during the 2023 holiday season. This year, her job hunt has been marred by disappointment after disappointment. Ms Secord, 52, sent her resume to retailers including Costco and Target, hoping her experience working in retail would help. But each application was met with either radio silence or a rejection. "It was incredibly stressful because the price of groceries has gone up, the cost of living in general is ridiculous," said Ms Secord, who finally landed a receptionist role in early November. The Star Bikers collect gifts for children who may otherwise get none. The £400 electricity bill for the festive display is paid for by Dan Noall and his family. Tzara Spurrier, known online as GlosBudgetMum, is hosting the event at Hesters Way Community Centre. The north-east London project is urging people to donate so all children get a present at Christmas. Jacob from Merseyside has met Santa one last time after an "amazing" response to his mum's plea.

Title: HP announces up to 6,000 job cuts as Apple trims sales roles in latest tech layoffs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/hp-announces-6000-layoffs-apple-cuts-sales-roles-10386557/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T04:11:45Z
Full Content:
The tech layoff wave seems to have swept over hundreds of thousands of professionals this week, with big names like Apple and HP announcing major job cuts. HP Inc., on Tuesday, November 25, said that it is likely to cut 4,000 to 6,000 jobs worldwide by 2028. The Palo Alto-based tech giant said that the move is in alignment with its larger plan to streamline operations and embrace AI to ramp up product development, boost productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction. As part of the announcement, HP CEO Enrique Lores said that the company’s staff from teams working on product development, internal operations, and customer support will be impacted. The CEO spoke about the potential impact of layoffs during a media briefing. He added that the company expects to create about $1 billion in gross run rate savings over the next three years. Earlier this year, HP sacked over 2,000 of its workforce as part of its previously announced restructuring plan. Similarly, on Tuesday, it was reported that Apple Inc. eliminated dozens of sales roles to streamline its product offerings for businesses, schools, and government agencies. Reportedly, the latest round of layoffs at Apple impacted account managers and staff responsible for handling Apple’s briefing centres for institutional meetings and product demos. According to a Bloomberg report, the iPhone maker confirmed its reshuffling, asserting that it is making changes to connect more with customers. The company also said that the affected employees can apply for new roles within Apple. Reportedly, Apple notified the affected workers over the past few weeks. The job cuts impacted across the sales organisation, with some teams being hit severely. However, Apple has refrained from divulging the actual number of employees impacted. The latest job cuts come weeks after the tech giant slashed about 20 roles in its teams based in Australia and New Zealand. The latest development comes at a time when Apple’s revenue has been on the rise and it is set to make sales worth $140 billion in the December quarter. In October, it was reported that Apple topped $4 trillion in market value for the first time, making it the third big tech company to hit the milestone. While internally, it has been reported that Apple is viewing these layoffs as part of its vision to streamline its sales teams and reduce the overlapping of roles. However, some reports also suggest that the move is likely an effort to transfer more of its sales to third-party resellers, which Apple terms as ‘channels’. Companies often opt for indirect sellers to reduce internal costs like salaries. It needs to be noted that unlike other tech giants, Apple views layoffs as a ‘last resort’ and is seldom seen announcing massive job cuts compared to Google, Amazon, or Meta. According to layoff.fyi, the month of October saw 21 companies lay off as many as 18,510 employees, with companies like Amazon announcing that it was planning to lay off over 14,000 corporate workers with its burgeoning investments in AI. The e-commerce giant said that it is cutting jobs to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic as it looks at boosting its investments in AI. This would be the biggest corporate job cuts in the history of Amazon. Meanwhile, in November, 20 tech companies have so far laid off 4,545 employees. The biggest layoffs this month were carried out by chip-design software maker Synopsys, which laid off about 2,000 of its employees, constituting nearly 10 per cent of its workforce. A regulatory filing revealed that the company trimmed its workforce in an effort to redirect its investments towards growth opportunities. This year so far 1,114,124 employees have been handed over the pink slip by 237 tech companies. India and South Africa will face off in the 1st ODI of the 3-match series on Sunday. After a whitewash in the Test series, India is looking to start the white-ball leg on a positive note. There are speculations about the starting XI, with Yashasvi Jaiswal likely to open with Rohit Sharma and Ruturaj Gaikwad possibly getting a chance at No.4.

Title: 7 Grocery Store Chains With The Best Steaks, According To Shoppers

Time Published: 2025-11-26T01:20:00Z

Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others. When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line. Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations. Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada, balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many styles of cooking. While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit. Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp. While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers. One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five). Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak. Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak "supreme." Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores. They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included. As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors.

PHOTO: HP/FACEBOOK Published Nov 26, 2025, 08:45 AM Updated Nov 26, 2025, 07:08 PM San Francisco – Computer and printer-maker HP announced on Nov 25 a sweeping restructuring plan that will eliminate about 10 per cent of its workforce globally, as the company pivots towards arti­ficial intelligence (AI) to boost efficiency. According to its latest earnings report, the tech giant expects to reduce­ its global headcount by between 4,000 and 6,000 employees to focus on adopting AI to increase innovation and customer satisfaction. In response to The Straits Times’ queries on Singapore layoffs, HP Singapore declined to comment. HP’s move reflects a growing trend across the tech sector, where companies are investing heavily in AI development while using the technology to reduce operational costs. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have announced workforce reductions over the past two years, with many citing the need to reallocate resources, including jobs, towards AI initiatives. Industry analysts say AI automation is particularly affecting roles in customer support, content moderation, data entry and certain computer programming tasks. HP said its AI plan aims to generate approximately US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion) in annual savings by the end of fiscal 2028. The company has been working to transform its business model amid changing demand patterns in the PC and printing markets. HP chief executive Enrique Lores told The Wall Street Journal that the company plans to raise the prices of its computers and work with new suppliers to help offset the higher costs of AI computing. In its latest quarter, HP posted a profit of US$795 million, compared with US$906 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.2 per cent to US$14.64 billion, topping analyst estimates with sales in PCs offsetting a decline in printer sales. Since opening its first factory in Singapore in 1970, HP’s presence in the Republic has evolved into a strategic innovation hub, with research and development across print, personal systems and smart manufacturing applications. It was last reported in September 2021 that HP Singapore employed more than 3,000 people. Its current Singapore headcount was not disclosed.

Title: Dell’s stock rises on AI server demand, but HP slides after announcing layoffs and weak guidance

UPDATED 18:51 EST / NOVEMBER 25 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the personal computer makers Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. were heading in opposite directions in the after-hours market today after offering contrasting guidance for the next three months. In the case of Dell, which is still led by its namesake founder Michael Dell (pictured) investors looked bullish after the company forecast stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue thanks to what it said is strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. HP, on the other hand, offered a forecast that came in below Wall Street’s estimates and said it’s planning to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 people over the next two years, accounting for up to 10% of its total workforce. Dell’s results in the quarter just gone weren’t great, as they missed the Street’s targets on revenue. The company reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.59 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.47. But it could only deliver revenue of $27.01 billion, up 11% from a year ago but shy of the $27.13 billion estimate. All told, Dell delivered $1.54 billion in net income, rising from $1.17 billion in the same quarter last year. For the current quarter, things are looking better, though, as Dell is expecting about $31.5 billion in total sales at the midpoint of its forecast range, well ahead of the Street’s $27.59 billion target. The company is also forecasting healthy earnings of around $3.50 per share, surpassing the $3.21 forecast. AI is the primary reason for Dell’s bullish forecast. The company said it’s raising its overall revenue forecast for AI server shipments to $25 billion, up from an earlier forecast of just $20 billion. It also boosted its full-year revenue target to $111.7 billion, up from $107 billion. Wall Street reacted positively to the report, with Dell’s stock gaining more than 3% in after-hours trading. Dell has in fact become a major bellwether for the AI infrastructure market and its overall health, as it’s one of the top manufacturers of server systems featuring Nvidia Corp.’s powerful graphics processing units. Most of its customers are large enterprises, government agencies and so-called “neocloud” providers such as CoreWeave Inc. It sells fewer servers to the big cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC, also known as “hyperscalers,” which often buy GPUs directly from Nvidia. Still, there’s an enormous market for Dell’s servers, and it said it’s expecting to ship about $9.4 billion worth in the current quarter. But that doesn’t include a recent deal it announced that will see it ship Nvidia GB300-based systems to a neocloud company called Iren Ltd., which subsequently plans to rent their capacity to Microsoft Corp. Dell’s server business is part of its broader Infrastructure Solutions Group, which delivered $14.11 billion in sales during the previous quarter, in-line with the Street’s expectations. Within that segment, server sales and networking parts generated $10.1 billion in sales, up 37% on an annual basis, with $5.6 billion spent on AI servers. The company also sold $4 billion worth of storage systems during the quarter. “AI momentum is accelerating in the second half of the year,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “Dell is winning in AI because of our unique ability to engineer bespoke high-performance solutions, rapidly deploy large, complex clusters, and provide global support.” Dell’s other main business is, of course, PCs and laptops. They fall in the company’s Client Solutions Group, which reported revenue of $12.48 billion in the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier but trailing the Street’s forecast of $12.65 billion. Clarke said on a conference call with analysts that the company expects PC and laptop sales to get a boost from Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows 10 last month. Many enterprises have only just started refreshing their portfolios as they scramble to upgrade to Windows 11. “Dell is riding the AI wave with its server business growing by an impressive rate,” said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research. “Servers and networking are now poised to overtake the company’s once-biggest revenue stream, namely PCs. That’s because of AI. The company is on the rise, and investors were pleased to see its profitability grow along with its revenue.” As for HP, the main focus of investors wasn’t its results, but rather its glum forecast and the fact that the company intends to lay off so many thousands of workers. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 93 cents per share on sales of $14.64 billion, edging past the Street’s targets of 92 cents and $14.48 billion in revenue, respectively. Despite the results, HP’s revenue only gained 4% from a year earlier, while net income rose slightly to $795 million in the quarter, from $763 million one year ago. The PC and printer maker’s snail’s pace revenue growth was a concern, and equally alarming for investors was the forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. HP said it’s looking for earnings of between 73 cents and 81 cents per share, short of the consensus estimate of 79 cents. For the full year, the company sees earnings at between $2.90 and $3.20 per share, trailing the analyst’s target of $3.33. The company didn’t issue any revenue guidance. In a statement, HP said its outlook reflects the additional costs that stem from current U.S. trade-related regulations and “associated mitigations” implemented by the company. HP Chief Executive Enrique Lores (pictured below) tried to put a brave face on what is a very glum picture, saying the results reinforce the power of its portfolio and the strength of the company’s teams. However, investors and analysts were much more interested in hearing about the reasons behind the company’s decision to lay off so many staff. Lores said he expects the headcount reduction to be completed by the end of the company’s fiscal 2028 year – two years from now, so it’s going to be a relatively slow process. It will help the company to realize savings of at least $1 billion in its annualized gross run rate by that time. However, it will incur approximately $650 million in charges, with a $250 million hit expected in fiscal 2026. Lores said the restructuring plan is part of an initiative that will see the company adopt more AI automation to try to accelerate product and software development. It’s planning to automate some customer support services, as well as many of its internal business processes. “We really think this is a unique opportunity we cannot miss to really continue to transform the company and continue to be competitive for the next 10, 20 years,” he told analysts on a call. “I think any work is going to be impacted by AI, and we need to take advantage of it as a company.” The layoffs come at a time when HP is facing significantly higher costs in its PC business, thanks to surging demand for chips in the AI data center industry driving up the price of memory chips. “Memory costs are currently 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,” Lores said. To counter this, Lores said the company will increase the price of many of its PCs and laptops and work with some lower-cost suppliers on ways to reduce the memory configuration of their products to offset some of these costs. However, the company still expects to see a net headwind of abut 30 cents per share in the current fiscal year, Lores said. “It is a very significant number, and this is net of all the actions that we are already putting in place,” he added. However, the company’s efforts weren’t enough to satisfy investors, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading. During the previous quarter, HP’s personal systems unit, which covers laptops and desktop PCs, delivered $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above the analyst forecast of $10.15 billion. Lores said on the call that the company expects to see sales improve following the end of support for Windows 10, explaining that this will prompt a lot of businesses to upgrade and buy new PCs. Currently, only about 60% of HP’s installed base has moved to Windows 11, the CEO pointed out. HP’s other main business is printers, which delivered $4.3 billion in sales during the quarter, down 4% from a year ago and just below the Street’s forecast. The company explained that it’s dealing with a competitive pricing environment that has put off a lot of customers from purchasing new models. Mueller told SiliconANGLE that the biggest problem for HP is that it only has two main business lines — PCs and printers, unlike Dell, which has its fast-growing data center infrastructure business. “The reliance on these two markets means HP is very exposed to supply chain shifts, and it’s currently dealing with much higher memory chip prices,” the analyst said. “However, that’s also true for its rivals and so HP needs to do better. It’ll need to convince customers that its PCs are worth paying a bit more for, or else reduce its cost base somewhere else. Investors will also be interested to see how the company’s automation efforts will make up for the reduction in full-time employees.” As of Tuesday’s market close, HP’s stock is now down 27% in the year to date, while Dell is up 7% over the same timeframe. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 15% this year. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Several top AI chipmakers lost ground as a potential deal between two Big Tech giants underscored competitive pressures in the market. Meanwhile, shares of an electronics retailer moved higher after a strong quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes rose for the third straight session as investors grew increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its December meeting. The Dow rose 1.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.9%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.7% higher. See here for more from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) shares jumped 10% to log Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of electronic test and measurement solutions topped quarterly earnings estimates. The company's sales outlook came in ahead of expectations, boosted by strong demand from AI data centers. Keysight also announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Shares of companies exposed to the housing market extended their recent rise amid growing optimism about a cut in interest rates, which would lead to lower mortgage rates. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) stock surged close to 9% Tuesday, adding to solid gains posted by the residential construction materials supplier in the prior session. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected same-store sales, revenue, and adjusted profit for the third quarter, and its shares powered over 5% higher. The company also raised its full-year outlook, pointing to consumer resilience as well as gains in the computer, tablet, and gaming categories as customers upgrade and replace older devices. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped nearly 3% following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is evaluating using AI chips from Google. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed close to 2% to finish at a fresh high. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock lost 3.7% after the parent of its namesake fruit spreads, Jif peanut butter, and Folgers coffee released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Although sales for the period edged out forecasts and adjusted profit matched expectations, Smucker's full-year profit outlook disappointed. The company has raised its coffee prices as it navigates tariff pressures but said it would refrain from additional price hikes this winter after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.

Title: When Is It Going To Happen? The Truth Is That It Is Happening Now…

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Most Americans are exceedingly focused on the present and spend very little time thinking about the future. And if you are in the minority of the population that is thriving in this “K-shaped economy”, you may be wondering what all of the fuss is about. After all, during the holiday season of 2025 wealthy Americans are literally spending money as if there is no tomorrow. But meanwhile, just about everyone else is really struggling. For a long time, we were warned that a cost of living crisis would be coming. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that delinquency rates would rise because consumers were piling up too much debt. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that foreclosure filings would surge when the current housing bubble started to burst. That is happening now. For a long time, we were warned that cryptocurrency prices would plummet. Now more than a trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth has been wiped out. Another thing that we have been relentlessly warned about is the weakness of the labor market. Today, we learned that “the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks”… The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That’s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP’s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. This confirms what I have been saying. All over the nation, large companies have been conducting mass layoffs. In fact, Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that the number of announced job cuts last month was 175 percent higher than it was in October 2024… Layoff tracker Challenger, Gray & Christmas recorded 153,074 job cuts in October alone — a staggering 175 percent jump from last year and 183 percent from September. It was the sharpest October spike since 2003, when companies were reeling from the dot-com collapse. We aren’t talking about something that might hypothetically happen someday. This is happening now. In just the last three months, many of the biggest companies in America have been ruthlessly firing highly paid employees… Over the past three months, Amazon, Apple, UPS, Intel, Verizon, AT&T, Walmart, Target, Ford, and GM have all made headlines for slashing white-collar staff — a broad corporate reset that shows little sign of slowing. I keep trying to tell everyone that this is just the beginning. The McKinsey Global Institute is warning that approximately 40 percent of all U.S. workers could potentially be replaced by AI… About 40 percent of American jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute. The American consultancy’s analysis found that robots and AI agents could automate more than half of US work hours, both manual and cognitive, using technology that is available today, if companies redesigned how they did things. Most of the roles at risk involve the kinds of drafting, processing information and routine reasoning that AI agents can do. What would you do if you suddenly lost your job? You might want to start thinking about that. The American people can see where things are headed, and that is clearly reflected in the latest consumer confidence numbers… Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board’s Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. As economic conditions deteriorate, we are going to see a lot more turmoil in the housing market. One housing analyst named Melody Wright is even projecting that the price crash that we are going to witness is going to be “worse than 2008”… The U.S. housing market is going to face a price correction “worse than 2008,” according to housing analyst Melody Wright, who expects home prices to drop in half as soon as next year. “I think…we’re going to correct all the way to a point where household median income matches the home price, the median home price. And so that is going to be worse than 2008. This could devolve a lot faster than last time,” Wright said during an interview with Adam Taggart, host of Thoughtful Money, published on YouTube. Our system could not handle a crash of that magnitude. But what goes up must come down. It has become very difficult to sell homes at today’s absurdly elevated prices, and as a result large numbers of sellers are simply pulling their listings… Homesellers in the US are yanking listings off the market, as the nation’s real estate sector stagnates. Nearly 85,000 sellers removed their properties in September, the highest number for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. The number of stale listings — those sitting on the market for 60 days or more — jumped to the highest level for any September since 2019. Nobody can argue with any of the facts that I have shared in this article. When people disagree with me, they tend to call me names instead. And that is okay. I fully understand that the reality of what is talking place all around us is not welcome news to a lot of people out there. But if we are not willing to face reality, we will inevitably make bad decisions. And making bad decisions is what got us into this giant mess in the first place.

Title: AI Is Rewriting How Pharma Engages Patients And Doctors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasefeiger/2025/11/25/ai-is-rewriting-how-pharma-engages-patients-and-doctors/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T20:11:42Z

ByChase Feiger, M.D., Contributor. For two decades, the branded pharma website has been treated as the centerpiece of digital engagement. It has been the polished ‘front door’, where brands prepared to tell their story and hoped clinicians and patients would arrive to listen. Websites still get foot traffic, but they’ve become houses people notice as they pass by, not doors where they open, enter, and spend their precious time. Traffic still flows, but engagement is collapsing. Not because content teams aren’t working hard enough, and not because brand managers aren’t investing. The truth is more fundamental: the world no longer interacts with information in the way that pharma websites expect them to. Healthcare’s literacy problem is well documented. Only 12% of U.S. adults possess proficient health literacy, while nine in ten struggle to understand the health information they encounter, a statistic that has remained stubbornly unchanged across CDC and HHS assessments for many years. Physicians are far from immune: many report that branded HCP portals and even dedicated pharma apps are difficult to navigate and fail to surface clinically relevant information. The content isn’t the issue; the medium is. The pharma website is still built around linear navigation, dense text, and a user journey that presumes time, attention, and a willingness to hunt for answers. Real-world behavior shows the opposite. Behavior Has Changed But Technology Has Not Kept Pace Two major behavioral shifts define the current moment. According to Frank Defesche, senior vice president & general manager of life sciences for Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), "pharma has spent decades pushing compliant, comprehensive content across brand sites and channels, but consumption habits have shifted. LLMs are now major consumers of that content, reshaping relevance and accessibility. Patients and providers no longer tolerate ‘scroll and read’ experience. Instead, they expect direct answers. With the right guardrails, AI can deliver contextual, on-demand information that aligns compliance with how people actually seek knowledge today. Without that shift, the right facts and the right voices will get lost in the noise." For consumers, AI-assisted health queries have moved mainstream. Among U.S. adults who search online for health-questions, roughly 30% say they often or always receive the answer they need from AI-generated responses. For clinicians, nearly two-thirds of physicians report using some form of AI in clinical practice, an 80% year-over-year jump, according to recent AMA data. Both groups have adopted a new expectation: ask and receive, not hunt and click. AI is no longer a novelty layered onto the healthcare system; it is becoming the operating mechanism underpinning it. Clinical AI pathways at Cedars-Sinai have handled tens of thousands of encounters. United Kingdom’s NHS deployed AI tools that dramatically accelerate stroke decision-making for tens of thousands of patients each year. Information seeking has become universally and rapidly conversational and consumerized. Clinicians and patients are consumers, too, and they are passing static websites by as they navigate to more consumer-friendly locations. The Industry Keeps Maintaining Websites While Users Pass Them By Pharma maintains hundreds of sites across brands and markets, often investing millions annually to keep them compliant and current. Yet engagement metrics continue to decline. Despite this shift, pharma continues to justify brand.com investments in part because the sites provide key first-party data, offering brands a window into how clinicians and patients alike engage with their brand content. However, even when a website wanes, the data and insights it once produced need not vanish. Emerging, pharma-built AI engagement layers allow brands to collect compliant, high-fidelity interaction data from within the exact channels where clinicians and patients already spend their time, including email, SMS, social and, yes, even websites. Rather than "driving" users to a single channel in an attempt to understand their behavior, brands can offer higher quality engagement - that in turn yields higher quality data - by meeting the patients and providers that they serve where they already are. The reason is structural. Websites require users to come to them. Even traffic that is ‘driven’ to a website frequently requires a user to leave the channel they started in, be it television, social media, email, and enter an entirely new engagement channel. Personalized, in-flow content repeatedly outperforms generic site content, driving improvements in engagement. But most pharma sites cannot personalize meaningfully without breaking existing infrastructure constraints. That’s why companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are taking a different path. “Healthcare is personal. Lilly is focused on moving away from static, generic websites to transforming consumer insights into personalized content embedded in their daily 'life flow.’ In collaboration with our tech and data partners, AI is enabling us to upend the old approach and to help meet users where they already are, driving increased engagement and improved patient outcomes,” says Jennifer Oleksiw, global chief customer officer at Eli Lilly. Increasingly, AI is enabling pharma to upend the old approach, and to meet users where they already are. AI Is Rapidly Enabling a New Interface Layer The future of digital engagement will not take place on static websites. It will occur in the realization of a long-imagined omnichannel interface layer, powered by AI, that seamlessly marries scientific accuracy, regulatory compliance, personalization, channel orchestration, and user intent AI is collapsing what once required multiple, separate, complex, and expensive technology stacks such as CRM, content engines, analytics, and UX. What has emerged in its place is a single, integrated system capable of delivering compliant, context-specific answers instantly, and helping brands quickly and compliantly adapt to the changing needs and engagement preferences of their users. Global investment reflects this shift: the AI-in-healthcare market is estimated at $26.6 billion today, and is projected to surpass $180 billion by 2030. This is not innovation theater. It is not small-scale pilots. It is enterprise-wide infrastructure investment in an entirely new modality of engagement between brands and the clinicians and patients they serve. However, general purpose and consumer-favored generative AI tools cannot simply be slapped on top of existing pharma brand sites and be expected to deliver on this promise. Regulatory constraints, including strict regulatory review and submission requirements, demand a new architecture that combines the AI-powered experience users demand with the regulatory-led precision pharma requires. In other words, AI must be able to deliver exactly what consumers want, when they want it, while simultaneously only delivering exactly what pharma regulatory teams have approved, in the form it was approved. This constraint is not an obstacle. It is an opportunity. It is the reason the interface layer must be intentionally and thoughtfully built, and done so through the collaboration of technology and industry leaders. The Opportunity for Pharma Let’s make no mistake: whomever owns the interface layer will own the relationship that clinicians and patients have with the life-saving treatments and products they use. And this is a clear and present danger for today’s pharma companies. According to Arpa Garay, former chief commercial officer at Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and former chief marketing officer at Merck (NYSE: MRK), "the next competitive battleground isn’t reach or channel expansion, it’s whether our science shows up precisely when and where questions are asked. As AI becomes the first point of interpretation for patients and providers, the brands that win will be the ones whose data, evidence, and value propositions are instantly accessible and contextually accurate. This shift isn’t optional. It’s central to how commercial teams will earn trust and relevance in the years ahead.” Consumer tech companies are already deploying medical-grade agents capable of triaging questions, surfacing recommendations, and shaping clinical decisions. And patients and providers alike are using them at increasing rates, asking and answering questions without ever reaching a pharma website. Health systems are likewise building their own AI-powered engagement layers, bring conversational support directly to patients and enabling more and deeper provider interactions. Pharma’s own digital front doors, the pricey brand.com websites, are at increasing risk of becoming an afterthought. The next phase of digital health will belong to organizations that recognize and embrace this shift. For pharma to keep pace, and to take its rightful and important place in the conversations patients and providers are having about its treatments, this means recognizing two fundamental truths: With pharma supplying the trusted content, and technology partners providing a compliant integration layer, the result is not just a new coat of paint on the front door that patients and providers have stopped looking for. It is an opportunity to insert pharma directly into the spaces where those same patients and providers are conversing, and to ensure that those conversations are backed by top tier science and regulatory compliance. The future of digital engagement will not be defined by assets, pages, or campaigns. It will be defined by who controls the intelligent layer that connects the right information to the right user at the right moment, regardless of channel. That requires deep, bidirectional collaboration between pharma organizations, AI-native health technology companies, and large infrastructure providers. No single party can deliver this alone. The ecosystem is too fractured, the data requirements too complex, and the compliance demands too unforgiving. A New Metric: Relevance, Not Traffic For years, digital success was measured by visits, clicks, dwell time, and bounce rates. Those metrics belong to the era of static websites. In an AI-first environment, the defining question becomes: Did the user receive the right, compliant answer at the exact moment they needed it? If a cardiologist can ask a complex, label-bound question through an embedded, approved agent, and receive a precise, context-aware response instantly, and is able to quickly proceed with the care of her patient, then why should any of us care about the channel through which that cardiologist received her answer? Driving traffic to a static website is not the purpose; it never was. The brand.com website is simply one channel among many that exist for a purpose that has never been more important: to provide clear, accessible, and accurate information to patients and providers so that they can move forward confidently in their healthcare journey and receive the care into which pharma companies invest so much to bring to life. Engagement, not activity, is the point. Leading commercial organizations are already reframing their approach, including Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), which has been pushing its teams to think less about clicks and more about whether their science shows up when and where it’s needed most. As Murdo Gordon, executive vice president, global commercial operations at Amgen, puts it: “AI is collapsing the distance between a question and its answer. For commercial teams, that means our focus must shift from driving people to assets to ensuring our science shows up, accurately and instantly, wherever the question is asked. That’s the future of engagement and it will reshape how we measure success.” The Website Isn’t Dying, It’s Being Superseded The decline of the static pharma website is not a failure. It is the natural progression of an industry shifting from narrower, specific channels designed for one-way communication to a broader, context-aware, and conversational form of engagement. The brands that lead the next decade will not be the ones with the best websites or the largest search budgets. They will be the ones that break free from the cycle of repainting their brand.com front doors and venture out boldly into the new AI-powered world in which their patients and providers are already immersed. They will be the ones that partner with pharma-first technology companies to enable the intelligent, compliant, omnichannel layer that replaces the website entirely, the layer that meets clinicians and patients where they already are.

Title: Why the GenAI Infrastructure Boom May Break Historical Patterns

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom—usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won. GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend: First, as I discuss in my prior post, the chips powering today’s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial—Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors’ assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s—much of it still in use today—enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon’s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure—shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth—but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. As I’ve discussed here previously, the chips powering today’s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the “GPU treadmill”—namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships—they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage—more cargo meant higher bills—but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge “reasonable and just” rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn’t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI’s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this “success” would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using “walled gardens” that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions—infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others’ applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or “sherlocking” the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the “brain” of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic—the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis—resides within the infrastructure provider’s model, not the customer’s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to “renting cognition,” allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft’s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence—they’re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized “spillover” benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained Tuesday afternoon, extending Monday's rally to start a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked 0.1% higher. Kohl's (KSS) saw its shares surge 35% after the department store chain reported a surprise third-quarter profit. The results came a day after the retailer said it would remove the "interim" tag from CEO Michael Bender's title to take over the top job permanently after its prior CEO lasted just months before being ousted over allegations of improper dealings with a vendor. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) was another retailer that soared Tuesday, with shares up 30% after the company topped third-quarter earnings estimates. Sales growth has slowed among its namesake brand, but picked up for Hollister, which executives said is expected to carry the company's sales for the holiday season. Videoconference software maker Zoom Communications (ZM) also posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares 12% higher. The company said it is seeing meaningful adoption of its AI offerings. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank close to 4%, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 Tuesday following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using chips from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares of Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chipmakers also slid. Coinbase (COIN) stock was one of several connected to the cryptocurrency sector, along with Robinhood (HOOD), Mara Holdings (MARA), and Strategy (MSTR), that extended their recent declines as the price of Bitcoin lost ground, trading around $87,200. The price of gold rose, and crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 4.00%. The U.S. dollar lost ground against the pound, yen, and euro.

The company frames the move as restructuring rather than financial trouble, potentially signaling a shift toward third-party resellers and new strategic priorities. When business is good, companies tend to hire more people in order to meet the demand. However, when business is bad or slow, that’s when companies conduct layoffs. But are things going badly at Apple, so much so that the company is conducting layoffs across different sales roles? That’s what’s allegedly happening, according to a report from Bloomberg. According to the report, Apple has eliminated roles primarily within its enterprise sales division. The affected positions include account managers handling corporate, education, and government clients. It also includes employees at Apple’s briefing centers, where the company hosts high-level product demonstrations for major customers. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as Apple doing badly. Instead, Apple frames these layoffs at its sales division as a restructuring to streamline operations and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. The company says it’s still hiring in other areas and has encouraged affected staff to apply for open internal positions. Some employees have been given deadlines to find new roles within Apple before receiving their severance packages. According to some affected employees, they believe the company is shifting more enterprise business to third-party resellers. This means potentially reduced salary and support costs. The government sales team appears to be hit particularly hard. The division was already struggling with federal budget constraints and a prolonged US government shutdown that slowed the closing of deals. Apple has built a reputation for treating layoffs as an absolute last resort. While competitors spent 2023 and 2024 cutting thousands of positions, Apple largely avoided massive workforce reductions. This is versus other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies slashed thousands of jobs during recent downturns. What makes these Apple sales layoffs interesting and kind of weird is the timing. The company recently reported approximately $140 billion in revenue for the December quarter. Like we said, companies tend to cut jobs when things are bad. But cutting jobs during strong financial performance sends a different message. Perhaps this is Apple’s way of diverting its resources to other investments, like in AI, where it appears to be currently struggling. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Railway Bubble vs. the AI Bubble

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 25, 2025 by Ben Carlson Everyone is trying to put the massive AI spend by technology companies into context. The easiest historical analogies are the telecomm buildout in the 1990s dot-com bubble and the railway bubbles of the 1800s. Each period was defined by excessive infrastructure spending, investor euphoria, and bubbles that popped but still had lasting positive effects. I’m familiar with the railway bubble because I wrote an entire chapter about that time frame in my book Don’t Fall For It. While the similarities between then and now are striking, there were far more nefarious activities that occurred during the 19th century. What follows is a condensed version of what appeared in my book. ******* Innovation breeds change, change breeds emotion, and emotion adds fuel to the fire when making money decisions. There’s a reason financial bubbles are called manias — they elicit heightened levels of energy, excitement, and activity. Hucksters are drawn to financial manias like moths to a flame because it’s easier to deceive people when they think humanity is entering a “new era” or “paradigm shift.” George Hudson saw the British railway bubble of the mid-19th century as an opportune time to profit from the excitement in the air. There was a wave of innovation taking place, and the emotions of the crowd who were looking to get rich quickly led to one of the more underrated historical bubbles on record. Like most bubbles, the railway mania actually started out as a good idea that was taken too far by investors and those selling railway projects alike. The first commuter trains appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1820s. They traveled just 12.5 miles per hour which reduced the trip from London to Glasgow to 24 hours. Without a hint of sarcasm The Railway Times asked, “What more could any reasonable man want?” The initial railway mania hit in 1825 with the opening of the first steam engine train. An economic downturn snuffed out any speculation and by 1840, shares of the main railway companies were selling at a discount to their issue price (stocks acted more like bonds than stocks back then). At this point, 2,000 miles of track were complete, leading some to speculate that the national railway system in Britain was already finished. Memories are short when people think there’s money to be made so this first mini-mania in railway stocks became a distant memory by the summer of 1842. That’s when Prince Albert of the Royal Family persuaded Queen Victoria to make her first train ride. That was the all-clear investors needed to hop aboard the railway-stock train. By 1844, investors viewed these companies as safe and secure, with huge upside potential. It didn’t take long for that cautious optimism to morph into reckless euphoria. George Hudson was one of the original modern capitalists, using publicity, salesmanship, and a cult of personality to attract enormous amounts of capital and goodwill from the public. Best described by his contemporaries as energetic, abrasive, bullying, penny pinching, rule-bending and overweight, Hudson was also a shrewd businessman who knew how to persuade people. Innovation helped trains travel further distances and carry heavier loads so Hudson pounced on the opportunity by creating his own line of railways in the 1830s. Through a series of consolidations, mergers, schemes, bribes, acquisitions, and an uncanny ability to sell, Hudson consolidated more power than anyone in the industry, eventually creating the largest railway company in Britain. By 1844, Hudson oversaw one-third of the total tracks in operation, measuring over one thousand miles in distance. He was the embodiment of the get-rich-quick era of the railway mania. Company heads were not paid the astronomical sums CEOs can earn today so Hudson became frustrated with how little he was earning for his work. Cutting corners was his solution to increase his wealth. Auditing was basically non-existent at the time which allowed Hudson to go nuts. He did this by keeping his fellow directors and shareholders in the dark about the inner workings of his companies. This included a refusal to hold finance meetings, changes to accounting methods, and general obfuscation about the financial statements. When Hudson joined the board of one railway company in 1842, his first order of business was announcing an immediate change to the company’s accounting methods, proclaiming, “I will have no statistics on my railway!” Nearly five hundred new railway companies were in existence by the summer of 1845, with stock prices in the sector up a cool 500 percent. As share prices rose during the 1840s so too did Hudson’s bank account. The palatial estate he purchased at the entrance to Hyde Park was the largest private home in all of London. His name became synonymous with success as the mere mention of his name by promoters provided enough credibility for the sale of stock on a new railway project. Hudson quickly became one of the most prominent figures in the social and political class of Great Britain in the nineteenth century through a combination of wealth, fame, and charisma. Although he was skilled at selling, Hudson didn’t exactly have to twist anyone’s arm to invest in these new products. Money was flowing in faster than Usain Bolt with the wind at his back. By June 1945 the Board of Trade was considering over eight thousand miles of new railway, which was four times more than the existing system and almost twenty times the length of England. There were literally plans for tracks that started nowhere and went nowhere with no stops along the way. The estimated cost of the nearly twelve hundred railways under consideration was more than £560 million. That was more than the national income of the entire country! The most mind-boggling aspect of all this money pouring in is that it all came from private investors. This wasn’t the government investing in the infrastructure of their country but investors who were looking to get rich. There were just three railway journals at the outset of the 1840s, led by the Railway Times. By the time the mania reached its zenith in 1845, there were fourteen bi-weekly railway papers, two daily editions, and one which was published every day in both the morning and the evening. At the start of 1845, sixteen new railway proposals were underway and over 50 new companies were formed to meet this demand. Advertisements flooded the newspapers and periodicals. The media pounced on the Queen Victoria train ride, proclaiming the railways as a revolutionary development for mankind, sparking interest from the public in all things rail travel. Hudson was far ahead of the game in terms of understanding the power of the press and how to use it to expand his empire. It helped that he had a financial interest in three newspapers that would all run flattering pieces about his projects to attract investors. There is a rumor that Hudson even tried to support a radical new publication called the Daily News and have Charles Dickens as the editor. Dickens was not a fan of Hudson and supposedly remarked, “that he [Dickens] should be the last man in the world to be a supporter of it.” The schemes worked like this: newspaper ads would promise a 10 percent dividend for anyone who put money into a new railway project. If the project got enough funding, the directors would hold onto a large allocation of shares in the newly formed corporation. This created enough scarcity to push up the price from the flood of new investors which thereby allowed the directors to flood the market with their shares by selling at a premium price. George Hudson was a master at this scheme, promising unsustainable dividend yields of 50 percent to inflate the share prices on certain issues, which only encouraged more insider trading by himself and the company directors. These were blatant pump and dump schemes. The investing public didn’t seem to care. Parliament published a report in the summer of 1845 revealing the identity of twenty thousand investors who had subscribed for at least £2,000 or more worth of railway stocks. Hudson’s name was on there, of course, but so were 157 members of Parliament and almost 260 clergymen. Investors included the likes of Charles Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and the Bronte sisters. Darwin is said to have lost up to 60 percent in the aftermath of the mania and that was actually much better than most fared in the bloodbath that followed. The rest were mostly regular people, showing how broad the speculation was. Many investors were subscribed for more shares than they could ever hope to pay for but the idea was they would all have the chance to sell at a premium before getting all of their capital called in to create the actual railway projects. Most people assumed the greater fool theory applied but no one planned on being the last fool standing. The mania was particularly strong in the suburbs because these were the areas that could see the biggest impact from the infrastructure buildout from the new train tracks. In one town, there was a group of stockbrokers who would take an express train twice a day to relay information from one town to the next on the latest changes in share prices for the railway stocks. Practically all the money for the construction of the railways came from individuals. By 1850, the amount invested was around £250 million, almost half the GDP of Great Britain at the time. There’s an old saying that markets take the stairs up but the elevator down and the railway stocks were no different. Rising interest rates were the first pinprick in the railway bubble in the summer of 1845. Increased competition and overinvestment finally brought these companies back to earth. Bankruptcies hit an all-time high in 1846, just a year after the height of the mania. People from all walks of life and levels of wealth were ruined. By the start of 1850, railway share prices had fallen an astronomical 85 percent on average. By 1849, Hudson’s role as Railway King came to an unceremonious end. Four of the railway companies he was heavily involved in were under investigation. The shady personal transactions, embezzlement of company funds, overstating of profits, bribing members of Parliament to push his projects through, and insider trading schemes were all made public. The twelve reports produced about his business dealings forever changed public perception of the once-revered businessman. The high society Hudson so eagerly sought to be a part of immediately turned their back on him. Hudson was never prosecuted in a court of law because securities laws at the time didn’t protect shareholders the way they do now. But he was tried and convicted in the court of public opinion and ostracized by the elite class, which may have been even more of a blow to his gigantic ego. The press sang Hudson’s praises when things were going well but turned their back on him when things went awry. The Railway Times published what was basically his business obituary but they also came down hard on the investors who went along for the ride: He no more caused the railway mania than Napoleon caused the French Revolution. He was its child, its ornaments, and its boast. His talent for organisation was prodigious. No labour or speculation seemed to vast for his powers. He combined and systematised the attacks of a hundred bands upon the public purse; he raised all the fares, he lowered the speed, he reduced the establishments, he ‘cooked’ all the reports, and he trebled all the shares. The shareholders wanted their dividends doubled, and their shares raised to a proportionate market value, They never calculated the extent to which these achievements were honestly practicable, or considered the measures to which it would be necessary to resort. They wanted the trick done all at once and Hudson was the man to do it. Hudson was able to stay afloat in political life for a few years after the bubble had burst but was eventually arrested for not paying his debts and died broke years later. A large number of tech start-ups with seemingly good ideas went out of business after the dot-com flameout. But that era planted the seeds for the next wave of innovation that occurred, which gave us services like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said, “All those ideas are working today. I can’t think of a single idea from that era that isn’t working today.” The railway boom and bust had some positive outcomes as well. Not all was lost from this period of untamed speculation, greed, and accounting fraud. By 1855, there were over 8,000 miles of railroad track in operation, giving Britain the highest density of railroad tracks in the world, measuring seven times the length of France or Germany. The railways set up during the bubble years came to represent 90 percent of the total length of the current British railway system. People and businesses across the country experienced massive gains in efficiency through cheaper and faster transportation of raw materials, finished products, and passengers. During the 1840s more than half a million people were employed by the railway companies to make those tracks a reality. Tens of thousands of people from Ireland were provided employment throughout their famine years. In many ways, this was a wealth transfer from rich and middle-class speculators to the labor class that simultaneously provided the country with much needed transportation infrastructure. News distribution spread, and the capital markets became more mature. New stock markets were set up in cities all over the country. Stock brokerage firms grew from six in 1830 to almost thirty by 1847. There was greater innovation during the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century but the railway boom required far more capital, and thus investors, so this changed the way the middle class invested their money. The problem for those trying to handicap the financial ramifications of this innovation is that the economic impact doesn’t always occur at the same time. Investors extrapolate innovation indefinitely into the future, carrying prices too far, too fast. It took time for the combustion engine to completely replace the horse and carriage. The promises of the Internet came true, but we had to live through the dot-com crash to get there. Excitement pervades when new technologies are released. Most of the early car companies flamed out. As car ownership first took off in the 1920s there were 108 automakers in the U.S. By the 1950s, they were whittled down to the big three. The entire airline industry basically lost money or went out of business in the century after air travel was invented. But investors become so enthusiastic they never stop to wonder what could go wrong, only how the world could change, and more importantly, how rich they will become in the process. The siren song of innovation means there will invariably be a new gold rush every time we collectively get excited about a shiny new toy. Those innovations may change the way we live but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to make you wealthy in the process. ******* I wrote this 6 years ago before ChatGPT was a thing and no one was talking about AI. It’s interesting to revisit now. Is AI the next railway bubble? The next dot-com bubble? It might not be the worst outcome.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Novo Nordisk phase 2 trial with amycretin reports significant weight loss and HbA1c reduction in type 2 diabetes

Time Published: 2025-11-25T11:24:00Z

November 25, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 25 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced positive headline results from a phase 2 clinical trial with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes. This marks the first evaluation of amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes, further demonstrating Novo Nordisk’s commitment to advancing innovation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is a unimolecular agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and amylin receptors, intended for once-weekly subcutaneous administration and once-daily oral administration. The trial investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin and once-daily oral amycretin compared to placebo in 448 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor as standard of care. Approximately 40% of all participants were using an SGLT2 inhibitor before initiating the trial. The trial was a combined multiple ascending dose study, investigating six subcutaneous doses from 0.4 mg to 40 mg administered weekly, and three daily oral doses of 6 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg, with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8%, once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin achieved dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c of up to -1.8% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving HbA1c <7% and ≤6.5% was up to 89.1% and 76.2% respectively. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%, people treated with once-daily oral amycretin achieved dose-dependent improvements in HbA1c of up to -1.5% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving an HbA1c level of <7% and ≤6.5% with once-daily oral amycretin was 77.6% and 62.6% respectively. By comparison, people treated with placebo achieved HbA1c improvement of -0.2% and -0.4% with subcutaneous and oral amycretin, respectively. The estimated improvements in HbA1c were all statistically significant versus placebo, confirming the primary endpoints of the trial. From a mean baseline body weight of 99.2 kg, subcutaneous amycretin achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -14.5% compared to -2.6% in people treated with placebo. People treated with the highest dose of subcutaneous amycretin were on the final maintenance dose for a duration of 4 weeks. Similarly, from a mean baseline body weight of 101.1 kg, people treated with oral amycretin also achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -10.1% compared to -2.5% in people treated with placebo. For the higher doses of amycretin, irrespective of administration route, no weight loss plateau was observed at week 36. In the trial, subcutaneous and oral amycretin appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile, consistent with other incretin and amylin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. “We are very encouraged by the phase 2 data with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes - the first time amycretin has been evaluated in this population. The data further validate the potential best-in-class profile of amycretin” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “Amycretin is built on the complementary biology of GLP-1 and amylin, and we are looking forward to bringing amycretin into an extensive phase 3 development programme across multiple indications in 2026”. Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning to initiate a phase 3 development programme with amycretin for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2026. About amycretinAmycretin is a unimolecular, long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist under development by Novo Nordisk to provide an efficacious and convenient treatment for adults with overweight or obesity and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is developed for oral and subcutaneous administration. About the Phase 2 trial in T2DThis trial is an interventional, multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel, double-blind (within arms), placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. The phase 2 trial investigated the safety, efficacy and PK properties of once-weekly subcutaneous and once-daily oral amycretin in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.0-10.0 %) on a stable dose of metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor. In the trial, close to two-thirds of the participants were male across both routes of administration. The trial consisted of nine active treatment arms. Participants received increasing doses of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin (0.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) in six groups, and oral amycretin (6 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) in three groups for up to 36 weeks. The primary objective is to determine and characterise the dose-response relationship of subcutaneous and oral amycretin on change in HbA1c from baseline to week 36 in participants with type 2 diabetes. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight (%) from baseline to week 36. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

November 25, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Jiayin Group Inc. Jiayin Group Inc. SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jiayin Group Inc. (“Jiayin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JFIN), a leading fintech platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights: _______________________1 “Loan facilitation volume” refers to the loan facilitation volume facilitated in Chinese Mainland during the period presented.2 “Repeat borrower contribution” for a given period refers to the percentage of loan facilitation volume in Chinese Mainland attributable to repeat borrowers during that period.“Repeat borrowers” during a certain period refers to borrowers who have borrowed in such period and have borrowed at least twice since such borrowers’ registration on our platform until the end of such period.3 “90 day+ delinquency ratio” refers to the outstanding principal balance of loans that were 91 to 180 calendar days past due as a percentage of the total outstanding principal balance of loans facilitated through the Company’s platform as of a specific date. Loans facilitated outside Chinese Mainland are not included in the calculation.4 Please see the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release. Mr. Yan Dinggui, the Company’s Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In the third quarter, we anchored our strategic focus on fortifying operational resilience and advancing prudent risk management. Despite the uncertainty in the macro environment, we reached our previously stated guidance of RMB32.2 billion in loan facilitation volume and RMB490.6 million in Non-GAAP income from operation. We have actively engaged with our financial institution partners to adapt to regulatory changes, while advancing our AI technologies and refining operational work flows, collectively elevating the quality and efficiency of our facilitation services. These efforts lay a robust foundation for sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to further consolidating our competitive edge in core domains, ensuring the Company stays at the vanguard of fintech innovation while delivering enduring, stakeholder-centric value.” Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net revenue was RMB1,470.2 million (US$206.5 million), representing an increase of 1.8% from the same period of 2024. Revenue from loan facilitation services was RMB1,220.7 million (US$171.5 million), representing an increase of 10.4% from the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher loan facilitation volume, partially offset by service fee adjustments. Revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities was RMB151.8 million (US$21.3 million) compared with RMB251.7 million in the same period of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average outstanding loan balances for which the Company provided guarantee services. Other revenue was RMB97.7 million (US$13.7 million), compared with RMB87.5 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the contribution from referral fees. Facilitation and servicing expense was RMB286.5 million (US$40.2 million) compared with RMB419.1 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to decreased expenses related to financial guarantee services. Allowance for uncollectible receivables, contract assets, loans receivable and others was RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million), representing a decrease of 87.1% from the same period of 2024, primarily due to decreased allowance for oversea loans as a result of disposal of Nigeria entities during 2024 and growth slowdown of receivables from loan facilitation business. Sales and marketing expense was RMB544.2 million (US$76.4 million), representing a decrease of 1.1% from the same period of 2024. General and administrative expense was RMB72.4 million (US$10.2 million), representing an increase of 29.0% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in share-based compensation. Research and development expense was RMB108.7 million (US$15.3 million), representing an increase of 13.3% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits. Income from operation was RMB456.9 million (US$64.2 million), representing an increase of 46.5% from the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP income from operation was RMB490.6 million (US$68.9 million), compared with RMB326.5 million in the same period of 2024. Net income was RMB376.5 million (US$52.9 million), representing an increase of 39.7% from the same period of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per share were both RMB1.83 (US$0.26) compared with RMB1.27 in the third quarter of 2024. Basic and diluted net income per ADS were both RMB7.32 (US$1.04) compared with RMB5.08 in the third quarter of 2024. Each ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares of the Company. Cash and cash equivalents were RMB124.2 million (US$17.4 million) as of September 30, 2025, compared with RMB316.2 million as of June 30, 2025. The following chart and table display the historical cumulative M3+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage for loan products facilitated through the Company’s platform in Chinese Mainland.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure We use non-GAAP income from operation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in our business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses. We believe that non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP income from operation represents income from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses. Such adjustment has no impact on income tax. Non-GAAP income from operation is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for income from operation, net income, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP results” set forth at the end of this press release.
