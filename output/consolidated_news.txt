We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Brewery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) stands against other best brewery stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The global alcohol industry is currently grappling with strict regulations, high taxes, inflation, and rising costs, which are likely to persist and may squeeze the profit margins of alcohol producers. The global brewing industry had been hit particularly hard as beer production worldwide fell to 1.88 billion hectoliters last year, representing a YoY decline of 0.9 %. Peter Hintermeier, Managing Director of BarthHaas, commented: “After we had managed to post modest growth in 2022 despite unfavorable conditions, we were expecting another small increase in 2023. However, energy, raw materials, packaging, logistics, and labor costs remained at a high level, which put pressure on the brewing business in many countries.” READ ALSO: 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds The American brewing industry is also faced with a declining demand, as beer consumption in the US last year fell to its lowest level since the 1970s, according to the Brewers’ Association. In fact, in 2022, the American spirits industry surpassed beer in revenue for the first time ever. The trend then continued in 2023, driven primarily by the spirits RTD category. Nevertheless, the country’s major brewers were still in good financial health, thanks to rising prices and a consumer shift towards more expensive, often imported beers. A major factor behind the decreasing demand is also global drinking habits have shifted dramatically over the last few years. The modern consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and seek alternatives to traditional alcoholic beverages, giving rise to the rapidly growing low and no-alcohol trend. To make sure they don’t miss out on the opportunity, several industry behemoths have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Despite the aforementioned challenges, the alcohol sector can be an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, simply because of the buffer it provides during tough economic times. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. Their sales are more related to the general trends of alcohol consumption per capita rather than the general state of the economy. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. According to a study by Cambridge University, the decreasing levels of average per capita income lead to very small changes in gross alcohol, wine, and beer consumption. In fact, the surge in unemployment during recessions could instead trigger an increase in the average alcohol intake. A great example of this is how Americans drank more alcohol during the pandemic and this was also reflected in the resultant imposts collected by the national kitty. Alcohol tax revenues collected by the U.S. Treasury Department rose by 8% in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2021, compared to the previous year, and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Another popular investment vehicle in the alcohol industry is rare whiskeys. Aptly named ‘Liquid Gold’, this beloved liquor can preserve and even increase in value during economic instabilities, inflationary periods, and recessions. One simply cannot forget about the bottle of The Emerald Isle Collection that sold in auction earlier this year for $2.8 million, or the 1975 cask of Ardbeg single malt which was acquired by a private collector in Asia in 2022 for over $20 million, more than double the amount Glenmorangie paid for the entire Ardbeg distillery and all its stock in 1997. The Rare Whisky 101 Apex 1000 Index tracks whiskeys that are highly sought after for collection. It has gained over 384% since 2013, against almost 301% gains by S&P’s famous benchmark of the top 500 companies for the same period. The RW Japanese 100 Index, which includes 100 collector’s bottles from Japan, has seen gains of around 350% since 2015. The index includes bottles like Ichiro’s Malt ‘Card’ Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, and King of Hearts, among others. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 12 companies operating in the brewing sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Beer Alcohol Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:CCU) is a beverage giant that operates in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The company, known for its Cristal brand, is one of the biggest brewers in its home country of Chile. It was announced in October that Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU), which distributes PepsiCo products in Chile, has struck a deal for its rights also in Paraguay. The company has acquired a 51% stake in Bebidas del Paraguay, Distribuidora del Paraguay, and AV, in association with Vierci Group. This marks Paraguay as the second country where CCU holds the PepsiCo license, promising growth and investment opportunities. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) had a mixed Q3 2024 as organic volumes were down 6.9%, mostly due to a weakened demand in Argentina. However, its Chilean segment saw a 7% revenue increase, driven by a 5.2% rise in prices and improved volumes. All in all, the company managed to achieve a net profit of CLP 29.55 million ($29.77 million) during the quarter, a significant 211% increase from the same period last year. CCU also offers an above-average annual dividend yield of 3.67% as of December 28, 2024. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) continues its focus on expanding its product line and recently launched Escudo Maki, a limited-edition variety produced with wild maquis collected by an agricultural cooperative in the south of Chile. Moreover, its subsidiary CPCh launched ‘Hard Fresh: Hard Soda’, a 5% ABV ready-to-drink cocktail in response to the growing demand for low alcohol options with nice flavors. In Q3 of 2024, shares of Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) were held by 3 hedge funds in the IM database, with First Eagle Investment Management holding the largest stake of 15.69 million shares, valued at around $182.47 million. Overall, CCU ranks 12th on our list of best brewery stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for CCU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CCU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) the Best Dividend Stock of 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Dividend Stocks of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other dividend stocks. Macroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation. Improved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve’s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024. Dividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019—a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates—dividends contributed 75% to the market’s overall returns. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company’s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not. Reflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers. This broader adoption of dividends has expanded the range of options for equity income investors, offering greater access to dynamic and high-growth companies. For instance, major tech companies that are market leaders have recently introduced dividends. Meanwhile, established tech giants demonstrate that dividend payments can coexist with innovation and reinvestment, proving that companies can excel at both. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a selection of dividend stocks and identified those that have provided positive returns in 2024. From this group, we focused on companies offering yields above 2% as of December 30. We then narrowed down the list by selecting companies with the most hedge fund investments, based on Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:JPM) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company. The company's diverse revenue streams make it an attractive investment option. With operations spanning consumer and commercial banking, capital markets, and asset management, its diversification enables strength in one sector to offset weaknesses in others, enhancing overall stability. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered an over 39% return to shareholders. In the third quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported revenue of $42.7 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same period last year. The company showed strong financial and operational results, with a net income of $12.9 billion and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 19%. The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) division performed well, with a 31% rise in investment banking fees and an 8% increase in the Market's revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) also proved to be a generous dividend payer, distributing around $3.06 billion in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share, yielding 2.09% as of December 30. At the end of Q3 2024, 105 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared with 111 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $8.6 billion. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Stocks just did something they haven’t done in nearly three decades | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US markets wrapped up a blockbuster 2024 by marking an achievement so rare that it’s only ever happened a handful of times. Despite US stocks closing lower Tuesday in a disappointing December that saw the Dow drop over 2,000 points, or about 5%, and the S&P 500 slide 2.5%, this was a stellar year for stocks. The S&P 500 gained more than 23% this year after rising 24% in 2023. The back-to-back gains of over 20% is the best performance for the benchmark index since 1997 and 1998, according to data from FactSet. It’s an extraordinary event for the modern-day version of the index. (Precursors also racked up that kind of performance three other times, in 1927 and 1928, 1935 and 1936 and in 1954 and 1955, according to a Bank of America analysis.) That means your retirement savings might be looking a little more cushioned than usual. Retirement plans in the form of a 401(k) or other pension fund are often invested in indices like the S&P 500. So, when stocks have a standout year, your account balance will benefit. Despite fizzling out in December and missing an expected “Santa Claus rally” to close out 2024, markets notched a blockbuster year, building off a strong 2023. Wall Street saw impressive returns this year as inflation cooled and consumer spending remained strong, while the job market proved solid but slowing. Investors were bullish on strong earnings growth for tech companies, and stocks surged following President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection in November. The blue-chip Dow index rose 12.9% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 28.6%. The S&P 500 is up by around 53% over the past two years, after a poor performance in 2022 that saw the index fall 20%. US markets have also outperformed stocks in Europe and Asia across this year. “Inflation is waning, interest-rate cuts are in motion and earnings are trending higher, all which bolster sentiment and provide valuation support,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. The consensus among big banks and research analysts appears to be continued growth into 2025 amid strong economic data, earnings growth and expectations of a business-friendly Trump administration. Analysts expect the S&P 500 to rise by 14.8% in 2025, according to FactSet. But some analysts say stocks are currently overvalued, and uncertainty over the speed of future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve as well as looming geopolitical risks could spark a selloff. With such eye-watering gains in the past two years, it is uncertain whether the bull market can last. “We believe the chances of another positive year in 2025 are favorable given the high probability of economic growth and a Fed that is likely to cut rates next year,” Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a December 30 note. “But if resurgent inflation takes rate cuts off the table or speculation gets out of hand, this bull market could have a difficult time making it through next year.” December was the worst month since April for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, according to data from FactSet, as selloffs in tech stocks dragged the indices lower. Indeed, it’s rare to see three straight years of 20% gains in the stock market, according to Callie Cox, chief ma﻿rket strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Everybody’s expecting a good year next year, and that leaves a lot of room for disappointment,” Cox told CNN. In September, the Fed began cutting interest rates after holding them at decades-highs since the summer of 2023. The combination of the Fed beginning to cut rates and strong economic growth boded well for US equities. Cooling inflation boosted investor optimism, but after its final policy meeting of the year, the Fed signaled there will be fewer cuts in 2025 than previously expected, which could sap the market’s momentum next year. S&P 500 index: US tech companies had a standout year and drove the S&P 500 23.3% higher. The “Magnificent Seven” of tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — have accounted for over 50% of the S&P 500’s total returns this year, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. And, since November 5, the Mag Seven stocks have accounted for over 96% of the S&P 500’s gains. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was a top performer of the year, surging 179%. While Big Tech stocks boosted gains, stock market breadth has been poor. Most companies in the S&P 500 have fallen since November, while the index has been helped by the Magnificent Seven’s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Dow Jones Industrial Average: The Dow gained 12.9% across the year. The blue-chip index peaked at a record just above 45,000 points on December 4 before falling 5% in December. American chipmaker Nvidia joined the Dow in November. Nasdaq Composite: The Nasdaq surged higher by 28.6% in 2024. The tech-heavy index was the star of the major indices and surged on investor confidence in tech and AI. Palantir (PLTR), the AI-focused data company whose stock rose almost 340% this year, joined the Nasdaq in December. US Treasuries: The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note edged to 4.57% on Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose by over 15% in 2024, signaling expectations of future economic growth and inflation. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note slid to 4.232% on Tuesday. The US dollar rose near the end of the year on expectations of economic growth. The US dollar surged after Trump’s reelection in November. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, is up over 7.1% across the year, according to data from FactSet. Bitcoin slid to $93,400 around by 4 p.m. on Tuesday and was down nearly 4% for the month. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has had a memorable year, surging by about 120% across 2024. That’s a turn of fortune from just two years ago, when bitcoin traded below $17,000 after the crypto industry imploded. Bitcoin — which is highly volatile — rallied this year as it continued to garner mainstream acceptance through Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrencies. Trump has tapped Paul Atkins, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto advocate, to be SEC chair. After Trump announced his pick, bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time. Gold also had a notable year, rising by 27% and outpacing the S&P 500. Investors often see gold as a safe haven against economic turmoil and inflation. When the Fed cuts rates, gold can become more appealing than income-paying assets like bonds. Gold’s rally, however, was also driven as central banks around the world continued to increase their gold reserves. Commodities: Which investment yielded the most surprising returns this year? Cocoa. Cocoa futures on the New York exchange surged more than 168% across the year. Futures prices for cocoa skyrocketed as climate issues disrupted cocoa harvests in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, where over 70% of global cocoa is produced. The squeeze in supply sent futures prices soaring. Futures for coffee and orange juice also surged this year due to erratic climate and poor outlooks for harvests. Futures contracts are often traded by institutional investors like big banks or asset management firms, as opposed to individual investors.

Title: The AI stocks that could boom in 2025

Big Tech stocks could have another big year in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) could continue to be some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence-driven stock boom, David Dietze, senior portfolio strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management, said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia — “the granddaddy of them all,” as Dietze puts it — soared more than 170% this year, giving it a roughly $3.3 trillion market capitalization as it rides tremendous revenue growth and overwhelming demand for its AI chips. Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon, which is also getting in on the chip game, surged more than 50%. Google parent Alphabet stock rose 40%, and Apple climbed more than 35%. The Magnificent 7 — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for about a third of the S&P 500 index’s gains this year, largely powered by excitement around new AI technologies. But Goldman Sachs (GS) has warned that this “unusual degree of market concentration” could pose a major risk next year. Stocks that have benefited from the AI boom have largely done so independent of interest rates. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t in for a correction as the market settles from the post-presidential election rally. Dietze said that could happen in the not-so-distant future. “They’re riding a secular tailwind of extreme innovation that could plow right through that,” Dietze said. “Nevertheless, no sector operates in a silo or a vacuum. If everything else around them is struggling, they’re gonna struggle a little bit, too.” Dietze said one major theme for 2025 will be: show me the money. While major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have poured billions into AI partnerships and their own initiatives, investors are likely going to start looking for proof of returns next year, Dietze said. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday,” he said. “These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that.’” “And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year,” Dietze said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a wealth manager's hands hovering over a laptop presenting a customer with investment options. YTD Share Price Performance as of December 30: 20.14% Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) aims to generate consistent income that surpasses the average yield of the S&P 500 by investing in dividend-paying companies or those with the potential to pay dividends. As of December 27, 2024, the ETF manages nearly $12.4 billion in assets, with a 0.33% expense ratio and a 1.74% 30-day SEC yield. Launched on February 22, 2022, Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) holds 52 stocks in its portfolio as of November 2024. CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing ETFs. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) is one of the top stocks in the Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV)’s portfolio. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) provides HVAC, refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation technologies globally. It operates in three segments – HVAC, offering heating, cooling, and ventilation products and services; Refrigeration, providing transport refrigeration and commercial cooling solutions; and Fire & Security, offering fire detection, suppression, and security technologies. In Q3 2024, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) reported a 20% increase in organic orders, positioning the company for continued growth in 2025. Despite challenges in residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China, the company achieved 4% organic sales growth. Strong aftermarket performance is set to deliver double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year. CARR repurchased $400 million in shares in Q3 and plans to repurchase $5 billion in shares by the end of next year. Carrier Global's adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up 3% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, pricing, and productivity, partially offset by higher interest expenses, tax rates, and share count. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database indicates that 45 hedge funds were bullish on Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR), the same as the prior quarter. Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.15 billion. Overall CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing dividend ETFs of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CGDV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CGDV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the US, P&G saw volume growth in most categories, but Greater China struggled, particularly in hair and oral care. On the positive side, grooming and fabric & home care segments showed growth.

Title: Why Aptiv PLC (APTV) Is One of the Best Environmental Stocks to Invest in Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. To compile our list of the 10 best environmental stocks to invest in right now, we used environmental ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 environment-friendly companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company plays a leading role in the transition to a sustainable and electrified transportation system by providing software and hardware solutions.

Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is investing heavily in the development of advanced technologies, including high-voltage electrical architecture solutions, battery management systems, and electric motor control systems for the EV market. The company is focused on developing cost-effective solutions for EVs, such as its modular electrical distribution systems, which can help reduce the overall cost of EV production. Additionally, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is working closely with its OEM customers to support the development of new EV platforms and models, including the integration of advanced safety and user experience features.

Title: Bitcoin Revolution: NYDIG About To Unlock The Largest Capital Pool In Finance
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nydig-unlock-largest-capital-pool-finance/
Time Published: 2024-12-31T09:30:13Z
Full Content:
In a move that could reshape the Bitcoin lending market, Stone Ridge subsidiary NYDIG is gearing up to channel one of the biggest capital reservoirs in traditional finance—insurance float—into BTC-backed loans. The news, detailed in the 2024 Investor Letter from Stone Ridge CEO Ross Stevens, immediately attracted attention across the industry after its publication on December 30. Marathon Digital advisor Sam Callahan, commenting on X, framed the impact succinctly: “NYDIG is about to unlock one of the largest investable pools of capital in the entire financial system—insurance float—and channel it into Bitcoin-backed loans. This is a big deal.” According to Callahan, improved lending efficiency could lead to “lower loan costs,” reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin, and ultimately “increased scarcity” and “higher demand and price,” fueling more institutional interest and broader adoption. Ross Stevens’ 2024 Investor Letter outlines how NYDIG, which has already facilitated billions of dollars in BTC-collateralized loans, intends to expand by leveraging “float.” In insurance and asset management, float refers to investable capital held in reserve, often used to generate returns while maintaining coverage obligations. According to the letter: “Now that we know Bitcoin can generate cash flow upon a sale, how about using Bitcoin to generate cash flow upon a non-sale? […] Our Bitcoin subsidiary NYDIG is preparing to enable all HODLers, including Stone Ridge, to unsheathe their weapon – borrowed fiat at a low rate – in an amount, and at a time, that is right for them. […] Imagine floatpowered HODLing. […] Stay tuned.” Stone Ridge’s vision positions Bitcoin-collateralized lending as potentially on par with traditional stock margin loans—both in risk profile and, eventually, in pricing. According to the letter, BTC’s realized volatility over the past five years falls within the 40th to 80th percentile of the largest 3,000 US stocks, suggesting it is “about as risky as a typical US stock.” “That means Bitcoin-backed loans are realistically less, and certainly no more, risky than a plain vanilla, Reg T, US stock margin loan,”the letter states, pointing out that current bitcoin-backed loan rates—at “S + ~450 to ~950”—are out of line with the lower margin loan rates typical for stock financing. Stone Ridge projects a compression of this premium over time, pushing BTC-backed loans closer to the “Reg T margin loan neighborhood.” Insurance float, famously leveraged by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (which increased its float from $114 billion in 2017 to $164 billion as of December 31, 2022), represents a massive well of investable capital. While Berkshire uses its float to finance acquisitions and investments, Stone Ridge aims to unlock similar avenues for BTC collateralization. Bringing this vast capital supply into Bitcoin could generate a powerful network effect. Stone Ridge’s letter envisions a cycle where greater liquidity and lower costs prevent premature selling of BTC (“HODLing”), thereby reducing supply on the open market. This reduced supply, in turn, could bolster BTC’s price, driving more institutional interest and heightened adoption. Callahan’s emphasis on the ramifications for BTC holders and the broader ecosystem echoes Stone Ridge’s bullish outlook: “NYDIG is about to unlock one of the largest investable pools of capital in the entire financial system… This is a big deal.” If successful, the initiative would allow BTC investors to leverage their holdings without resorting to outright sales, preserving potential upside while accessing fiat liquidity. A more efficient lending market, Stone Ridge argues, would sustain Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative, further strengthening institutional confidence and opening the possibility of broader mainstream participation. At press time, BTC traded at $92,881. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall.

Print Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.9% to 8,159.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% to 20,059.95, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% to 3,383.86 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. China's Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. Trading is set to resume in Tokyo on January 6, as markets will stay closed for the rest of the week for the New Year holidays. South Korean markets will be closed for New Year's Day and resume trading Thursday. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $71.61 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 59 cents to $74.58 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.22 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen. The euro cost $1.0409, little changed from $1.0410.

Title: 2024 The Year Of Crypto: From Bitcoin ETFs To Memecoins

Cryptocurrency on trading app, Bitcoin BTC with altcoin digital coin crypto currency, BNB, Ethereum, ... [+] Dogecoin, Cardano, defi p2p decentralized fintech market As the best year in crypto’s history comes to a close, it’s worth looking back at how it went and where it leaves us for 2025. BTC led the show this year. It began with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Fidelity, and other top institutions. Then the fourth Bitcoin Halving happened in April. Options contracts went on spot bitcoin ETFs, catalyzing mass adoption. American and Russian lawmakers proposed strategic bitcoin reserves, and then, the big milestone, bitcoin crossed the much-awaited $100,000 mark in early December. But 2024 wasn’t only about Bitcoin’s success. It was also about key infrastructural upgrades and cutting-edge innovations across Layer-2s, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and Crypto AI. Stablecoins, the the killer app in digital assets delivering the fiat on and off ramps to Web3.0 exploded in 2024 with a number of new issuers and a market cap of over $200 billion, and memecoins had a great run this year, garnering much interest from retail users and investors. Both retail and institutional interest led to holistic industry growth in 2024, driving new use cases and solving for real-world problems. Bitcoin ETFs have reached a market cap of over $132 billion, with more than $10 billion inflows since Donald Trump won the American presidential election. 2024 was also about the winds of political change and a new pro-crypto administration in the U.S. The appointment of former PayPal exec David Sacks as AI and crypto czar, and the appointment of former college football player and Republican congressional candidate Bo Hines to the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, chaired by Sacks, is helping 2025 to take shape rapidly. Add Paul Atkins who will become the new SEC Chair role, replacing Gary Gensler who will resign on January 20th, and the anticipated appointment of Brian Quintenz, a16z exec and the crypto policy right hand of former CFTC Commissioner Chris Giancarlo, crypto dad and uber crypto policy czar - the team that delivered the bitcoin future market, and it looks as if the U.S. is positioning to dominate crypto, globally. Ryan Chow, co-founder and ceo of Solv Protocol, says, “The approval of bitcoin ETFs has legitimized the asset class as an institutional grade investment. Besides the incoming liquidity and positive price activity, bitcoin ETFs have increased BTC’s popularity. It’s not surprising that Bitcoin DeFi has attracted more than $3 billion in TVL, despite its nascency.” Alongside bitcoin, AI emerged as a leading narrative, dominating crypto mindshare with an all-time high of 48 percent by November. Currently, the crypto-AI sector has a market cap of over $34 billion with a strong growth potential. Tiancheng Xie, co-founder and cto of Polyhedra Network, explained, “AI’s biggest challenges revolve around trust, transparency, and accountability, by utilizing blockchain in-particular zero knowledge proofs we can ensure verifiable data, fair contributor compensation, and a trustless builder ecosystem, which in-turn creates scalable innovation in a more trusted environment.” According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. Ben Wynn, cmo at House of ZK, echoed how infrastructure developments have been a major focus for the industry to increase overall capacity, saying, "Blockchain development continues to grow significantly, with over 23,000 monthly active developers globally in 2024 - a roughly 40 percent annual increase since 2015 - and ZK is growing even faster, with over a 50 percent annual growth over the past four years. ZK deployments have surged from 40 in 2020 to approximately 640 in 2024 - a 16x increase - reflecting its transition from mostly theoretical to more practical use, and it's becoming widely recognized as the foundation for solving the pressing challenges of scalability, privacy, interoperability, and more. "Its potential to transform every facet of blockchain is clear and, with adoption quickly accelerating, we expect developer activity in ZK to grow exponentially in the coming years" Overall, infrastructural improvements on the back-end are having a big positive effect in onboarding new users to crypto. In September 2024, a record-breaking 220 million wallet addresses interacted with a blockchain at least once, the highest ever in crypto’s history. On average, there are 30-60 million monthly active crypto users currently, or around 5-10 percent of the 617 million global crypto owners. The surge in on-chain interactions has been primarily driven by Solana, NEAR, and Base. Interestingly, Solana and Base also lead the list of chains in builder interest. Meanwhile Base, with a 10.7 percent builder interest, has some of the most popular memecoin projects like Brett and Goose.run driving user adoption. Memecoins are now a $130 billion industry, despite all the controversies surrounding this asset class. Many analysts consider the sudden rise of memecoins in 2024 as a speculative fad and aberration, with others considering it the epitome of digital culture and successfully leveraging speculation as a use case. As Riva Tez of LayerZero Labs said at Consensys 2024, memes have helped crypto win the "narrative war". Likewise, Momin Saqib, Brett ambassador, emphasized the memecoin narrative while noting, “Memecoins capture the spirit of the internet—playful, inclusive, and dynamic while their communities provide a rare sense of belonging in a day and age where loneliness is an epidemic in modern society. Brett for me stands out as a beacon of connection—uniting people through humor, vibrant communities, and shared experiences. It has become a movement that transforms digital engagement into joy, purpose, and inclusivity, all while driving real-world impact through its inspiring charitable initiatives in water and education.” Besides community formation, Ryan, core contributor of Goose.run, explained how memecoins create novel wealth-generating opportunities saying, “By monetizing meme’s virality, memecoins have shown how speculation can be a utility in itself. If memecoins, however, stay isolated in speculative trading, they’ll miss out on enormous untapped liquidity. It’s important to create a sub-sector of Meme Finance (MemeFi) to leverage memecoins in DeFi to maximize their use cases.” Despite not being blue chip assets, memecoins are the second-most popular category dominating market narrative mindshare. Drew Cohen, marketing lead of GME on Ethereum, considers the spectacular success of memecoins as a revolt against VC-backed coins. Cohen explains, “Retail investors don’t have free and fair entry points for VC-backed tokens because the coins already have high valuations at launch. Memecoins create an equitable opportunity for everyone that challenges the VCs as gatekeepers of crypto finance. Thus, memecoins give power back to the masses.” Hatu Sheikh of Ape Terminal, also emphasizes the importance of retail investors in the crypto economy saying, “No industry can flourish until the general public invests in your projects. After all, institutional investors can only do so much. Protocols need to have a strong and diverse user base who will invest and become your most vocal marketing support in the long run.” As 2024 draws to a close, we see a simultaneous rise in bitcoin, infrastructure investment, institutional liquidity, and memecoings. Perhaps for the first time in fifteen years, there’s no one winner - in 2024, everyone's a winner - this time, it is appears very different. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The businesses that didn't make it through 2024

SPQR closed its doors in July. Photo: RNZ / Melanie Earley It's been a tough year for businesses around the country. In November, company liquidations were up 27 percent year-on-year, according to Centrix. Businesses large and small suffered - and even some big names did not make it. Here are some of the prominent businesses that did not survive 2024. Aucklanders were shocked in July when Ponsonby favourite SPQR closed its doors. The restaurant opened in 1992. "The hospitality industry is struggling and has been since the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it's hard out there for people and when the dollar is tight, this sector suffers," liquidator Stephen Lawrence told RNZ at the time. The fallout from SolarZero's liquidation continues. Owned by international asset manager BlackRock, SolarZero provided leased solar energy systems to about 15,000 houses around New Zealand. But it was placed into liquidation because the business was not sustainable, BlackRock said. The problem for the government is that the NZ Green investment Fund had set up a taxpayer-funded lending facility of $145m for SolarZero, of which it said about $115m had been drawn down. Maketū Pies went into liquidation, but was saved by new owners. Photo: Laura Smith There was some good news in this story for pie lovers. Maketū Pies went into liquidation in November after years of losses, but was saved by new owners. Privately owned catering business Montana Group took over the 42-year-old brand and its about 20 employees in early December. Organic and wholefoods grocer Huckleberry went into liquidation in the middle of the year. In their report, liquidators said the failure was driven by a downturn in customer numbers and spending, as well as a reduction in turnover. "The result of this was he revenue was no longer able to sustain the company's outgoings or expenses." Ezibuy hit trouble again this year. Its parent company, Mosaic Brands, appointed administrators. Its other brands, such as Katies and Millers, were also affected. Mosaic told the ASX that a "small number of stakeholders" did not support its proposals for restructure, or negotiating a commercial outcome, and Mosaic could not reach an acceptable resolution with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over proceedings relating to the late or non-delivery of goods during the pandemic. Last year, voluntary administrators were appointed to Ezibuy, which owed more than $100 million to creditors. At the time, Mosaic said its significant decline in sales through 2022 was at odds with the rest of the business. But Mosaic bought it back earlier this year, planning a simplified online-only operation. Wellington co-working space Digital Nomad did not make it until the end of the year, either. Liquidators said the main reason was that it was too difficult to maintain a sustainable level of tenants and revenue to make the operation profitable. "The working landscape has been changing in Wellington for the last few years since Covid-19 and the shift to working from home has made it particularly challenging to secure tenants." Auckland-based plumbing supplies business Franklins went into liquidation. It had been owned by the Smith family for 69 years. But it said the "changing landscape of the building industry and the current state of the economy" had led the director to make the decision to shut the business. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said he hoped the year ahead would be an easier one. "But business failures is a lagging indicator. Many businesses that limp through the recession are not in good shape for the recovery, so there will be a tail of businesses which will continue to fail for the next year or so. "But many other businesses will benefit from a cyclical recovery. The key risks are when the economic recovery takes hold: two headwinds from sharply slowing net migration and prospect of more intense fiscal austerity. "Both could delay the positive effects of lower interest rates and returning hope among consumers and businesses.

Copyright © 2024, Radio New Zealand Chris Rupe has thanked Aucklanders for their 27 years of patronage and urged them to support other locally owned hospitality businesses.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A portfolio manager confidently making decisions at a stock exchange building.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is no longer overshadowed by Nvidia and is now emerging as a powerhouse with significant growth potential. The Broadcom surge is fueled by the company’s stellar fourth quarter performance, with revenue jumping 51% year-over-year to $14.05 billion, driven by AI solutions and the integration of VMware. Full-year revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, with infrastructure software contributing $21.5 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also returned to profitability, reporting $6.97 billion in adjusted net income for Q4. AI chips are poised to be Broadcom's primary growth driver.

Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies.

The mission, titled "Owl The Way Up," launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand, on December 22 at 03:17 NZT. Aboard the Electron rocket, the mission carried a StriX synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite into orbit for Synspective, a Japanese company specializing in Earth observation. The deployment was part of a broader agreement involving 16 launches for Synspective, which has relied exclusively on Rocket Lab for its satellite constellation since 2020. Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and CEO, stated: "Mission success once again for Synspective, capping off our busiest launch year to date. We look forward to continuing to increase our launch cadence in the new year as we strengthen Electron's position as the leading small rocket globally, and also enter the medium launch market with Neutron's debut. In 2024 we launched missions for NASA, the NRO, deployed multiple missions for commercial constellation operators like Synspective, launched suborbital HASTE missions advancing hypersonic flight test capability, and to top it all off, we achieved a world first by launching two missions from two different hemispheres in less than 24 hours. Thank you and congratulations to the Rocket Lab team, our customers, and our mission partners for another stellar year." Rocket Lab's 16 successful missions in 2024 surpassed its previous annual record of 10 launches in 2023. The company also maintained a perfect mission success rate throughout the year. The next Electron launch is slated for the first quarter of 2025.

Title: Union Pacific Corporation (UNP): Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Logistics Stock Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.

The company is uniquely positioned as it serves many of the fastest-growing population centers in the United States while operating from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways and seamlessly connecting with Canada's rail systems. It is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has already laid the foundation for its success as it posted year-over-year improvements for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, in reportable injury rates, freight car velocity, and locomotive productivity among other major metrics. Recently, the company closed 2024’s third quarter, demonstrating strategic success. Improved safety and service performance drove solid revenue growth which translated into third-quarter earnings per diluted share up 10% and operating income up 11%. Hence, the firm is positioned well to lead in safety, service, and operational excellence. Overall UNP ranks 1st on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Recently, Northland analysts reiterated their Outperform rating for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD. Financial) and set a price target a price target of $175, or nearly a 40% upside from Tuesday's $125 close. Northland has AMD among its top picks for 2025 because it is also a confidence play, as the firm should be able to increase market share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and PC clients. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMD. Embedded gaming remains one of the headwinds for AMD, and its strategic roadmap is to overcome the respective headwinds and take full advantage of the growing demand for AI-driven technology. The projections say AI-related revenue could reach up to $5.2 billion by 2024 and increase to $9.5 billion by 2025, indicating solid growth potential. AMD's Turin CPUs also beat Intel's Granite Rapids in data center workloads, which is a big driver of its expected 10% growth in non-AI data center revenue to $8.5 billion in 2025. Also on the cusp of a possible PC market refresh cycle is the phase-out of Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) support for Windows 10, which could help push AMD client revenue up by 25%, year over year, to $7.9B in 2025, driven by upside potential. Despite the challenges in the gaming and embedded markets, Northland forecasts gaming revenues to remain flat, and embedded revenue is expected to return to $4 billion in 2025. The recent $333 million investment in AI cloud startup Vultr continues the company's focus on developing AI infrastructure and pushes its edge in the GPU market even further alongside Nvidia. AMD is positioned strongly financially and has a forward-looking innovation focus that is worth watching in the tech space. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: The Vanguard-FDIC Agreement On Passive Investing And Bank Ownership

Banks In a landmark development last week, Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers with nearly $9 trillion assets under management, agreed to new terms with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to clarify its role as a passive investor in U.S. banks. This decision, while important for Vanguard, may have broader implications for asset managers, the banking sector, and financial regulation. FDIC’s Push for Accountability The prominence of index fund managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, collectively overseeing more than $23 trillion in assets, has grown significantly over the past decades. These firms often hold substantial stakes in public companies, including banks, through their passive investment strategies. By mimicking indices such as the S&P 500, they have amassed considerable influence without actively managing or directing company operations​​. Historically, the regulatory framework has allowed asset managers to bypass stringent shareholder banking regulations, provided the asset managers do not influence management decisions. However, concerns have mounted the last few years about whether “self-certification” by these asset managers genuinely supported maintenance of their passive roles. With stakes exceeding 10 percent in many banks, questions arose about potential conflicts of interest and undue influence over critical financial institutions. Notably, FDIC board members, including Jonathan McKernan and Rohit Chopra, argued for more rigorous oversight. They highlighted the risks of concentrated ownership in a few hands and the implications for competitive fairness and economic stability​​. The FDIC began revising its approach in mid-2024, proposing tighter controls on investment firms crossing the 10 percent ownership threshold. Focusses included enhanced disclosure requirements and greater scrutiny of informal interactions between asset managers and bank executives​​. Vanguard’s Landmark Agreement On December 27, 2024, Vanguard finalized an agreement with the FDIC, addressing these regulatory concerns. Key provisions include: Implications for the Industry and Regulation This agreement signals a turning point in how passive investment giants operate within regulated sectors. By setting a precedent with Vanguard, the FDIC may ask other firms, notably BlackRock and State Street, to adopt similar agreements. Such measures aim to balance the benefits of passive investing—like broad market access and lower costs for investors—with the need for transparency and accountability in sensitive sectors like banking​​. Critics argue that increased regulatory oversight might discourage investments in banks, potentially harming the sector’s growth. Industry representatives contend that the FDIC’s actions lack a clear demonstration of harm, raising concerns about regulatory overreach​​. Conclusion Vanguard’s deal with the FDIC underscores the evolving relationship between regulators and financial powerhouses holding significant bank shares. The action could reshape the landscape of passive investing and its interplay with accountability and regulatory oversight. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin Traders Monitor Key Technical Levels Including $100,000
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/30/bitcoin-traders-monitor-key-technical-levels-including-100000/
Time Published: 2024-12-31T04:53:12Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin traders are watching several technical levels. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin traders who leverage technical analysis have been monitoring important levels of support and resistance, singling out $100,000 in particular as being psychologically significant. The world’s most prominent digital currency appears to be following a downward trend since reaching an all-time high of more than $108,000 on December 17, Coinbase data from TradingView reveals. On Monday, December 30, the cryptocurrency fell below $91,500, reaching its lowest level since late November, additional Coinbase figures show. In spite of this recent price activity, bitcoin is still in a strong, upward trend that has propelled it to multiple fresh, all-time highs over the last several months. Several analysts have noted this strong performance, including the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. The market observer emphasized such developments in emailed comments, stating that “We are still in a crypto bull market, even though it feels a bit different than previous cycles and we will see a lot of bullish price action in the crypto markets, primarily with Bitcoin.” “Closing 2024 Bitcoin is currently in a downtrend on the daily chart since hitting all-time high of $108,000 on 12/17/2024,” she noted. “I’m personally watching psychological levels like $100,000 and $90,000. These areas are important as most are not trading full-time and passive investors,” Wendy O clarified. “Those numbers spark excitement.” “When we look at $100,000 as resistance, it seems to be an area the masses may see as a good value to sell, and that could also be why we have been in a downtrend since hitting all-time high of $108,000,” she stated. Further, the analyst emphasized the strong institutional demand stemming from both BlackRock and MicroStrategy, and noted that as countries grow increasingly interested in using bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the digital asset’s price could easily push higher. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in, highlighting several technical levels. “On the downside, support could emerge around the $85,000–$86,000 zone, followed by the $80,000 level, and deeper at $75,000 if the market continues to decline,” he noted via emailed comments. “On the upside, resistance is likely to be encountered near $95,000–$96,000, with the $100,000 mark acting as a significant psychological barrier,” said DiPasquale. “If Bitcoin manages to break above $100,000, the $105,000 area could become the next key resistance level,” he pointed out. “Traders should also monitor volume around these levels to gauge the strength of any price action, while broader macroeconomic factors and sentiment will play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s medium-to-long-term direction,” the analyst emphasized. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered a different point of view. “Bitcoin has been truly range-bound, while showing more action to the downside, since December 20, three days after the most recent ATH,” he stated via email. “Counting today, it’s bounced off the $92k area three times. That level is also the bottom of a channel which started in November 2022, which has provided major support in the past (although not without fail),” said Enneking. “If $90k breaks, and the odds are about even that it will, there is some support of $88k, but the next bottom will probably be lower (although almost certainly still with an ‘8’ handle),” he stated. “By the time that plays out, inauguration euphoria will probably kick in with Bitcoiners licking their chops at the prospect of a pro-crypto administration and BTC turning into a reserve asset (N.B. Not a reserve currency) – and BTC will be primed for the next ATH,” Enneking predicted. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. One Community. Many Voices.

Stock indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday as the market delivered a downbeat finish on the final day of another milestone-shattering year on Wall Street. The S&P 500 gave up an early gain to finish down 0.4%. The benchmark index, which set 57 record highs in 2024, racked up a 23.3% gain for the year. This was its second straight year with a gain of more than 20%. The last time the index had as big a back-to-back annual gain was 1998. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. Big Tech stocks led this year’s rally, pushing the Nasdaq to a yearly gain of 28.6%. The Dow, which is far less weighted with tech, rose 12.9% for the year. The stock market's record-breaking turn in 2024 was “certainly much better that what most people on Wall Street, myself included, thought we would get this year,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. U.S. markets’ stellar run was driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Skyrocketing prices for companies in the artificial-intelligence business, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, helped lift the market to new heights. Solid corporate earnings growth also helped. Wall Street expects companies in the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Another boost for the market: The economy avoided a recession that many on Wall Street worried was inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked its main interest rate to a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy to beat high inflation. Receding inflation, which has gotten closer to the Fed’s 2% target, helped energize Wall Street, raising hopes that the central bank would deliver multiple interest rate cuts into next year, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. Still, after three interest rate cuts in 2024, the Fed has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 with inflation remaining sticky as the country prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to transition into the White House. Trump’s threats to hike tariffs on imported goods have raised anxiety that inflation could be reignited as companies pass along the higher costs from tariffs. This year’s market rally went beyond stocks. Bitcoin, which was below $17,000 just two years ago, climbed above $100,000 for the first time. And gold also shattered records on its way to a 27.4% gain for the year. Only about 38% of the stocks in the S&P 500 fell Tuesday, but a slide in technology stocks outweighed gains elsewhere in the market. Semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, fell 2.3%. Apple dropped 0.7%, and Advanced Micro Devices gave up 1.3%. Gains in energy stocks helped temper some of the declines. Exxon Mobil rose 1.7% and Chevron gained 1.2%. VeriSign rose 0.9% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had increased its stake in the internet domain registry services company. All told, the S&P 500 fell 25.31 points to 5,881.63 on Tuesday. The Dow lost 29.51 points to close at 42,544.22, and the Nasdaq slid 175.99 points to finish at 19,310.79. The market's mini post-Christmas slump doesn't bode well for a ‘Santa Claus’ rally, the term for when U.S. stock indexes get a boost in the last five trading days of a year, plus the first two in the new year. Such a rally correlates closely with positive returns in January and the upcoming year. Even so, missing out on the Santa Rally isn’t necessarily a negative omen. “Historically, a negative Santa Claus rally still resulted in an average gain of almost 6% in the subsequent year,” Stovall said. Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.54% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury held steady at 4.24%. Crude oil prices rose 1%. Indexes in Europe mostly rose. Asian markets ended mixed, with exchanges in Tokyo and Seoul closed for New Year holidays. Markets will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year’s Day holiday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their equity and options markets on Jan. 9 in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, continuing a long-held Wall Street tradition in mourning the nation’s leaders. The 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: How has the 21st century gone so wrong?

The Nasdaq had reached 4000, a nearly sixfold increase in seven years. Unemployment in the world’s largest economy had shrunk to 3 per cent, the lowest in more than a generation. Having borne the burden of the Cold War, the American people were reaping the peace dividend. Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin all seek radical change to the current world order.Credit: AP In other countries, the news was equally bright. The Europeans had introduced both a single market and a single currency and were well on their way to becoming a “United States of Europe”. The once-mighty communist international had dwindled to Cuba, North Korea and a few university departments. World trade in manufactured goods had doubled in the 1990s and would double again in the 2000s. Global poverty was receding faster than ever. A quarter of a century later, the mood could not be more different. A sizeable majority of the global population – three in five people – believe the world is getting worse. This is as true in traditionally optimistic America (which has just elected an irascible 78-year-old to succeed a faltering 82-year-old) as it is in stagnating Europe. The world’s second-biggest economy, China, is run by a proud Marxist-Leninist, Xi Jinping, whose achievements include removing limits on his time in power. The world’s most populous country, India, is in the hands of an illiberal strongman, Narendra Modi. China and Russia have built an axis of authoritarian states that are determined to push back against Western liberalism. Vladimir Putin’s “war on the West” has involved not just the invasion of Crimea and Ukraine and the dispatching of private militia across Africa, but numerous sorties, by plane and submarine, into Western territory. Xi has declared that any foreign power that tries to “bully, oppress, or enslave us” will “be battered and blooded from colliding with a great wall of steel forged by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people using flesh and blood”. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. Optimists might point out that the first quarter of the 21st century has been better than the first quarter of the 20th, when the Great War took the lives of 15 million people and provided the material for both communism and fascism, not to mention World War II. But the contrast with the optimism of the 1990s is nevertheless astonishing. And worse is almost certain to come. Some security officials believe we are engaged in an undeclared war with the “axis of autocracy”. Donald Trump, elected with a clear majority, has hinted he will pursue a policy of America First and may well destroy the institutions that undergirded postwar security. The EU is in a state of paralysis, with the leaders of the two most powerful countries, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, discredited and their economies stagnant. And tens of millions of people are likely to flee Africa and Latin America in coming years, driven by a combination of economic stagnation, political fragility and climate change, empowering the far right and undermining the stability of the West. As for the miracle of technology, one survey of AI researchers discovered that 48 per cent thought there was at least a 10 per cent chance that its impact would be “extremely bad”, that is, lead to human extinction. What has gone wrong with the 21st century? Let’s start by acknowledging that there have been successes. We have created an entire virtual world. Today, more than half the world’s population has some sort of internet access, and there are about as many mobile phones in the world as people – 8 billion-plus. This has ushered in a world of information and entertainment that never existed. There are more than a billion fewer people living on less than $US2.25 a day than there were in 2000, thanks to catch-up growth in developing countries. In 2012-13, the global poverty headcount fell by 130 million people, marking it as one of the most remarkable years in history. In December 2020, China declared it had eliminated extreme poverty completely. Yet even these positives contain negatives. The information revolution has undermined the business models of “old media” companies that put a premium on checking facts while, at the same time, empowering rumourmongers who depend on polarisation and misinformation. There has been no significant impact in reducing global poverty in the decade since 2015.Credit: Getty Images The spread of smartphones has coincided with the spread of psychological problems, particularly among the young. The war against poverty is going into reverse. In China, economic growth has slowed to a crawl. In Latin America and Africa, poverty rates are again rising, thanks to economic stagnation, political instability and rapid population growth. In all, the number of people living in absolute poverty has barely declined since 2015. The West has made a succession of policy errors that both weakened its elites and emboldened its autocratic critics. George W Bush invaded Iraq based on false information and then bungled the occupation. Angela Merkel, Germany’s powerful chancellor from 2005 to 2021, failed to address her country’s two biggest weaknesses: its dependence on Russian energy supplies and its failure to invest in its own defences. In the UK, David Cameron dealt with a feud within the Conservative Party by holding a popular referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, plunging the country into chaos and reducing its economic growth rate. The world has also lived through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which deepened the growing sense of economic injustice and paved the way for the rise of populism. The problem lies with more than just a handful of policy mistakes. It lies with the broader development of the global economy-cum-polity. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. What we got was the very opposite: oligopoly, government splurge and militarised blocs. The consolidation of capitalism is most advanced in the US, the leading economic power, and in tech and finance, suggesting that oligopoly is the way of the future. Five tech companies are each worth more than $US1 trillion ($1.6 trillion), and one, Apple, is worth more than $US3 trillion. Three big investment houses, BlackRock, the Vanguard Group and State Street, collectively manage around $US22 trillion in assets. Over the past two decades, industries have grown more concentrated. This may be the result of excellence: Google and Apple are superbly run, and Microsoft is undergoing a renaissance after a period in the doldrums. But would anyone argue that America’s airline industry is a model of innovation and customer service? The success of the superstar companies slows the rate of innovation and thwarts competition; the success of second-rate companies contributes to a general sense of frustration. It’s notable that the world’s first great age of populism, before World War I, coincided with the rise of giant companies, particularly in the US and Germany. Bill Clinton’s pronouncement in 1996 that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow.Credit: AP Meanwhile, Clinton’s pronouncement in another State of the Union Address, in 1996, that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow. Americans tax themselves like a small-government country but behave like a big-government one. The US deficit is roughly 6 per cent of GDP, twice the average of recent decades and the US government stepped in to save failing companies such as Citigroup and General Motors in 2008. The situation is worse in the EU, where government sprawl is not balanced by economic vigour. European countries spend beyond their means on welfare while the bureaucracy in Brussels prides itself on its role as “regulatory giant” rather than its ability to ignite growth. Putin put paid to talk of the “peace dividend” with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and Ukraine in 2022. But, in truth, the most serious threat to the global order comes from China, which has an economy 10 times the size of Russia and a much more disciplined leadership. From its admission into the World Trade Organisation in 2000, but gathering pace with the rise of Xi to the top job in 2013, China poured a portion of the “globalisation dividend” into building up its military might. China’s navy is the biggest in the world, and its nuclear arsenal may reach 1000 warheads by 2030, according to the US Department of Defence. It is also roaring ahead in tech. China has overtaken the West in hypersonic missiles – those capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound and evading air defences – and is pioneering lasers, orbiting space robots and high-altitude balloons. What are the chances that the next 25 years will be better than the last? The 21st century has seen the two most compelling ideologies of the 1990s malfunction horrendously. These are neo-liberalism, the belief that, overall, markets are more efficient than governments in organising economic life, and neo-conservatism, what started as a corrective to the left’s overconfidence in the power of the state to fix everything. The great danger in coming years is that we will see the further decline of a third ideology: liberalism. Across the West, liberal leaders are flailing. Kamala Harris decisively lost to a candidate who has broken one of the most important liberal rules: giving up power graciously when you lose an election. The two most flamboyant liberal politicians of the past decade – Macron in France and Justin Trudeau in Canada – are flailing. Keir Starmer won a landslide election victory in the UK on the promise of reviving the pragmatic centre only to make a mess of governing. Liberal elites have prepared the way for a populist backlash by a combination of commission and omission. They have fixated on cultural issues such as pronouns at a time when regular people are suffering from stagnant living standards. They have betrayed the principle of race-blind meritocracy by embracing race-conscious policies. And they have paid too little attention to growing worries about immigration even as expanding populations put pressure on housing and public services. The result has been to cede ground to populists such as Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs. There are some reasons for optimism about the future. The AI revolution has the potential to cut administrative costs while giving everyone the equivalent of a smart assistant. The collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is a serious setback for the “axis of autocracy”, reducing Russia’s influence in the Middle East and suggesting that even the most vicious dictators can be overthrown. The Republicans’ triumph in 2024 could prove self-correcting, creating opportunities for a new generation of middle-of-the-road Democrats. Yet all this potential could go the other way. AI may destroy the jobs of millions of knowledge workers, creating a radicalised middle class, while handing more power to a few tech giants. A newly liberated Syria may break up into warring territories or fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Trump and his allies may well destroy the rules-based international order that has largely kept the peace since 1945. An intriguing study of 120 years of populist governments suggests that the most common reaction to the failure of populism is for voters to demand yet more populism. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs or whether they will continue to drift and dither. Can they address the causes of populism, or will they continue to repeat empty phrases? Can they think like regular people, or will they continue to act like members of a global elite? Can they adapt classic liberal ideas about open competition and freedom of speech to radically new circumstances? What happens this next quarter-century depends on how well we answer these questions.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large fleet of freight trucks travelling down an interstate highway. Number of Hedge Funds: 38 Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) is one of the largest North American less-than-truckload motor carriers. The firm offers regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. ODFL also offers a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting, other than its core LTL services. The firm is a leading national LTL carrier, with third-party data validating its value proposition and opportunities for market share growth. The market share opportunity for Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) in the LTL market stays massive. The company is not just the leading but is deemed the best-positioned LTL carrier, with a solid history of significant revenue growth and profitability, superior customer service delivered at a fair price, ongoing opportunity to win market share, as well as an experienced and motivated team. Furthermore, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) continues to invest to keep moving forward, building on the aforementioned progress. The firm made significant real estate purchases from 2014 to 2023 of $2.1 billion to expand and improve the service center network. The capacity to grow supported by an unmatched investment in its network and equipment further reiterates the firm’s strong positioning. Overall ODFL ranks 8th on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ODFL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: NICE Ltd. (NICE) Downgraded: What Does CEO Transition Mean for Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NICE Ltd. (NASDAQ:NICE) stands against the other AI stocks. A December 30 report by CNBC discussed the rapid adoption of generative AI by businesses, its potential to significantly impact global GDP, and the varying perspectives of leaders on its future. As per the report, generative AI has evolved from a novelty to a key tool for businesses, with nearly two-thirds of organizations using it for tasks like customer service automation and data analysis. While its growth could potentially boost global GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade, opinions among business leaders vary. Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates view AI as transformative, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs. However, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella caution that further advancements will be slower, requiring deep innovation. Meanwhile, concerns about AI's ethical risks, highlighted by Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, suggest the technology could have unintended consequences, despite its growing importance in industries like defense. READ ALSO: 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn't Miss. CNBC’s TechCheck anchor, Deirdre Bosa reported on December 30 that DeepSeek, an open-source AI model developed by a Chinese research lab, has emerged as a serious competitor to leading models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.1. Despite using lower-cost H800 chips, which are less powerful versions of the H100, DeepSeek outperformed these models in key benchmarks and was built for just $5.5 million, a fraction of the cost of other frontier models that require hundreds of millions or even billions to develop. This signals a shift toward more commoditized AI models, where progress relies less on building new infrastructure and more on optimizing existing models. The development raises concerns for investors in major U.S. tech companies, as it challenges the long-standing dominance of firms like OpenAI. Additionally, the success of DeepSeek highlights the potential advantage of open-source models, suggesting that nations like China, without access to the latest chips or massive investments, could still compete effectively in the AI race, Bosa mentioned. The implications of this development, particularly for the U.S.-led AI dominance and global geopolitical dynamics are expected to unfold further in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

On December 19, Jefferies downgraded NICE (NASDAQ:NICE) from Buy to Hold, citing factors such as a CEO transition, slower-than-expected cloud growth for 2025, and heightened competition. The firm reduced its price target to $200 from $215. Incoming CEO Scott Russell, formerly of SAP, has received positive feedback, but Jefferies sees potential risks from the departure of long-time CEO Barak Eilam. Analyst Samad Samana forecasted 2025 cloud revenue growth at 15%, below the 16.6% consensus, and noted increasing competition in the CCaaS market from incumbents, large software vendors, and hyperscalers introducing GenAI tools. Overall, NICE ranks 3rd on our list of AI news that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NICE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NICE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump Disappoints Right, Sides With Musk In H-1B Debate

Time Published: 2024-12-30T22:54:17Z
Full Content:
US President-elect Donald Trump has thrown right-wing supporters for a curveball, siding with Elon Musk in support of H-1B visas for foreign workers. Musk found himself in the midst of a firestorm over the weekend when he voiced—in a profanity-laced X post—that H-1B visas played an important part in the American economy. As The New York Post points out, Musk’s post was in response to a one by Steven Mackey, in which Mackey used one of Musk’s popular business philosophies against him. The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot… The backlash has been swift and severe, especially from the diehard MAGA element of the Republican party, who want to see high-tech jobs go to Americans rather than foreign workers. Any hope such individuals had of Trump siding with them were dashed Saturday when he gave an exclusive statement to The Post voicing his support of the program. “I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said by phone. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,” added Trump. As The Post notes, this appears to be a change of stance for Trump, as has been critical of the H-1B program in the past, and took steps to curtail it during his first term. This is not the first time the H-1B has stirred controversy. In the wake of devastating rounds of layoffs toward the end of the pandemic, tech firms were securing thousands of H-1B visas so they could replace well-paid American workers with less-expensive foreign workers. The list of companies included Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Microsoft, Palantir, Salesforce, and Zoom. It’s a safe bet many have not forgotten tech companies seemingly using the H-1B program to pull a fast one in an effort to swap out large portions of their workforce for cheaper foreign workers. Only time will whether the MAGA crowd will win, or if Trump will continue to side with Musk.

Title: Is Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Pharma Dividend Stock to Buy In 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth. Looking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape. As executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs. In addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges. Our Methodology In this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating through two segments – Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment offers a range of human health products, including treatments for oncology, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetes, under well-known brands like Keytruda, Januvia, and Bridion. It also provides vaccines for various age groups under brands such as Gardasil and Pneumovax. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has recently partnered with the Chinese biopharma company Hansoh to develop an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for treating metabolic conditions and obesity, entering a market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite strong performances in oncology and vaccines, Merck’s stock has fallen 20% over the past six months. The licensing deal with Hansoh includes a $112 million upfront payment and up to $1.9 billion in royalties and milestones. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $16.7 billion in total revenues, a 4% increase, or 7% excluding foreign exchange effects. The human health business grew 8%, driven by oncology, while the Animal Health business saw an 11% sales increase. Key oncology product KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion, fueled by expanded use in both early and metastatic cancers. Lynparza revenue grew 13%, while sales of WELIREG more than doubled. GARDASIL sales decreased 10%, primarily due to a decline in China, though global sales increased in other regions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s full-year earnings guidance has been adjusted to $7.72 to $7.77 per share, factoring in foreign exchange and business developments. The company remains focused on innovation, dividend growth, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. On November 19, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, a 5.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is distributable on January 8, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 16. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database shows that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was held by 86 hedge funds, compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $800 million. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bank regulator gives BlackRock January deadline on bank stakes

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has told asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) it has until Jan. 10 to accept an agreement that would allow the agency to step up scrutiny of its investments in FDIC-regulated banking institutions, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Friday, the FDIC said it reached a similar deal with Vanguard strengthening the rules the asset manager must observe as a passive investor in FDIC-supervised banks, the latest step in a months-long tug-of-war between the banking regulator and the two biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The FDIC is pushing both firms to adopt "passivity agreements," which provide the regulator with more tools to monitor compliance on the part of the asset managers with pledges not to influence the business decisions of the FDIC-regulated banks in which they invest. The individual familiar with the state of the negotiations between BlackRock and the FDIC said the firm received the regulator's latest proposal on Friday, less than an hour after the announcement of the Vanguard agreement. That source said the wording of the proposed agreement is "substantively the same" as that of the Vanguard pact. The FDIC declined to comment on the Vanguard agreement or the negotiations with BlackRock. "We know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners," said Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a member of the FDIC board, in a statement released on Monday. "If a large asset manager is truly passive as it claims, it should have no problem complying" with the kind of passivity agreement the FDIC is seeking, Chopra said. In a public comment letter submitted to the FDIC in October, BlackRock said it already makes legally binding commitments to the Federal Reserve Board to remain a passive investor in U.S. banks. "BlackRock does not exercise control over FDIC-supervised institutions, nor does it seek to," Benjamin Tecmire, head of regulatory affairs, said in the letter. The FDIC has not stated what consequences might follow if BlackRock does not meet the Jan. 10 deadline.

These funds, which had exposure to assets managed by Sartor Administradora General de Fondos S.A.

As a result, Credicorp Capital (directly or through its affiliate) would assume creditor status with respect to Sartor, pursuing legal actions to recover funds and holding those responsible accountable.

Following a complaint filed by Credicorp Capital, the CMF issued a resolution on December 20, 2024, by which it (i) revoked Sartor's authorization to operate, and (ii) ordered the liquidation of all funds under Sartor's management. In response to this situation, Credicorp Capital has committed to acquiring through ASHC the value of the investment units from its clients within 45 days.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Pot Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) stands against other pot stocks to buy according to analysts. The global marijuana market is growing and the market for legal cannabis is expected to rise at a CAGR of 25.7% and reach $102.2 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Despite regulatory limitations, the cannabis industry is getting attention from investors, suppliers, and researchers. If we want to know how hedge funds feel about pot stocks, we recently covered 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In according to hedge fund sentiment. A total of 38 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal use. In addition, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow cannabis for adults’ recreational use. As the push for legalization continues to grow, more people are accepting the idea of legalizing marijuana across the US. The US is the leading country with the highest weed consumption in the world. If you want to know where most weed is consumed in the US (See Here: 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US). The American legal cannabis industry experienced notable growth in 2023 as legal sales across the US were $28.8 billion, up by 10.3% year-over-year. Consequently, the legal cannabis market added 22,952 new jobs in 2023, reflecting a better business atmosphere, especially in the cannabis industry. In 2024, the legal cannabis industry supported over 440,445 jobs, an increase of 5.4% from 2023, as per the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report. The major driver for the cannabis industry remains the rising demand for its use for medical purposes. In the coming years, new markets are expected to fuel growth in the cannabis industry. One such example is Nebraska’s vote in favour of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As we write this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia. However, selling or possessing marijuana remains a crime under federal law. In November, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, which was a major setback for the legal cannabis industry in the US. Amendment 3 fell short of the required 60% threshold for legalization, despite historic funding levels and an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida remains home to the country’s largest medical marijuana market, adding around $2 billion in annual revenue. Amendment 3 could have boosted the cannabis market to a projected $6 billion by 2026. Florida voters will have to wait for two more years until cannabis legalization gets back on the ballot. Florida has disappointed cannabis investors and consumers and it has had an impact on cannabis stocks. One of the first cannabis ETFs, Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, has plunged over 45% since November 4, as of December 23. ​​You can also visit and see 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

December 30, 2024 17:05 ET | Source: CREDICORP LTD. C/O BANCO DE CREDITO CREDICORP LTD. C/O BANCO DE CREDITO Lima, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LIMA, PERU, December 30, 2024 – Credicorp Ltd. (“Credicorp”) (NYSE: BAP | BVL: BAP), the leading financial services holding company in Peru with a presence in Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, and Panama, announced today that its subsidiary Credicorp Capital S.A. Sociedad Administradora de Fondos (“Credicorp Capital”), has notified its clients that it has offered to purchase 100% of the value of investments in the Credicorp Capital Factoring Dólares FMIV and Credicorp Capital Factoring Soles FMIV funds. These funds, which had exposure to assets managed by Sartor Administradora General de Fondos S.A. (“Sartor”) in Chile, a third-party fund manager, were impacted by recent regulatory actions and alleged misconduct at Sartor. To facilitate the purchase process, Credicorp Capital will execute participation transfer agreements through its affiliate Atlantic Security Holding Corporation (ASHC), covering up to US$125.3 million in investment value. As a result, Credicorp Capital (directly or through its affiliate) would assume creditor status with respect to Sartor, pursuing legal actions to recover funds and holding those responsible accountable. Credicorp expects to partially recover these funds and will be providing updates as they become available. As publicly disclosed, the Chilean Financial Market Commission (CMF) recently ordered the suspension of contributions, as well as redemptions and payments, of all funds managed by Sartor, which included the Credicorp Capital Factoring Soles FMIV and Credicorp Capital Factoring Dólares FMIV funds. Following a complaint filed by Credicorp Capital, the CMF issued a resolution on December 20, 2024, by which it (i) revoked Sartor’s authorization to operate, and (ii) ordered the liquidation of all funds under Sartor’s management. In response to this situation, Credicorp Capital has committed to acquiring through ASHC the value of the investment units from its clients within 45 days. This move seeks to ensure that clients will not bear the uncertainty of the liquidation process of Sartor-managed funds, which was mandated by the CMF. About Credicorp Ltd. Credicorp Ltd. (NYSE: BAP) is the leading financial services holding company in Peru, with a diversified business portfolio organized into four primary lines of business: Universal Banking, through Banco de Crédito del Perú (BCP) and Banco de Crédito de Bolivia; Microfinance, through Mibanco in Peru and Colombia; Insurance and Pension Funds, through Grupo Pacifico and Prima AFP; and Investment Management and Advisory, through Credicorp Capital and ASB Bank Corp. Credicorp has a presence in Peru, Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, and Panama. Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Title: Dungeons & Dragons causes controversy with rule change over identity

Fox News Insider "Races" are now "species" in the beloved game Dungeons & Dragons, which recently marked its 50th anniversary, irking some loyal fans. "Some character traits have been divorced from biological identity; a mountain dwarf is no longer inherently brawny and durable, a high elf no longer intelligent and dexterous by definition," a report in The New York Times explains. "And Wizards of the Coast, the Dungeons & Dragons publisher owned by Hasbro, has endorsed a trend throughout role-playing games in which players are empowered to halt the proceedings if they ever feel uncomfortable." The company also now suggests that extended Dungeons & Dragons campaigns begin with sessions allowing players to lay out their expectations and which topics they wish to avoid, which could include sexual assault or drug use, the Times writes. "What they’re trying to do here is put up a signal flare, to not only current players but potential future players, that this game is a safe, inclusive, thoughtful and sensitive approach to fantasy storytelling," said Ryan Lessard, a writer and frequent Dungeons & Dragons dungeon master, according to the report. ENTERTAINMENT INSIDER SAYS ESG FUNDING IS WHY WOKE ENTERTAINMENT KEEPS GETTING MADE DESPITE LOSING AUDIENCES Chris Pine, star of the "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" movie. (Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images) But some gamers are frustrated. "It’s an unnecessary thing," Robert J. Kuntz, an award-winning game designer who frequently collaborated with Gary Gygax, a co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons, told the Times. "It attempts to play into something that I’m not sure is even worthy of addressing, as if the word ‘race’ is bad." AP UNDER FIRE AFTER OLYMPIC BOXER WHO FAILED GENDER TEST NAMED AMONG ‘FEMALE ATHLETES OF THE YEAR’ Wizards of the Coast executives defended the new rules by saying players desired greater leeway in creating their characters. But some have slammed the attempt at a more "inclusive" game that some argue comes at the expense of the game's authenticity. Darren Kent on the "Dungeons & Dragons" red carpet. (Carey Dodd Associates) BLACKROCK ADMITS ESG ADVOCACY COULD PROVE BAD FOR BUSINESS In an X thread about the new Wizards of the Coast Players Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide that analyzed D&D’s origins in the 1970s, users blasted WoTC and Hasbro for distancing themselves from the game's original creators due to their apparent insensitivites. The foreword claims the original role-playing game largely excluded women or portrayed them "disrespectfully," and portrayed slavery "not as a human tragedy but as a commercial transaction." "Wizards of the woke," one X user said in response to the passage. X owner Elon Musk weighed in with an even blunter message. "Nobody, and I mean nobody, gets to trash E. Gary Gygax and the geniuses who created Dungeons & Dragons," he wrote. "What the f--- is wrong with Hasbro and WoTC?? May they burn in hell." Musk also weighed in on a passage Babylon Bee editor Kyle Mann highlighted in which players in the game's latest iteration are encouraged to signal if they are triggered by any of the game's content. "Wtf," Musk simply replied. Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment. Mark Kern, a former team lead of "World of Warcraft," recently weighed in on how the video game industry and entertainment at large cater to progressive views in their content in exchange for access to money. One consultant agency, Sweet Baby Inc., for instance, described itself as an "inclusion-focused narrative and consultation company" working toward "diversifying and enriching the video games industry." "There is a coordinated effort to insert diversity politics into games by ALL parties involved to the detriment of the quality of the games themselves. Sweet Baby’s Inc.’s very public and self published involvement is just the tip of the iceberg," Kern told Fox News Digital.

Title: Chopra: Regulators Must Do More to Ensure Investment Managers Aren’t ‘Improperly Influencing’ Banks
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/chopra-regulators-must-do-more-to-ensure-investment-managers-arent-improperly-influencing-banks/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:44:43Z
Full Content:
Recent steps taken by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will help ensure that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” decisions made by FDIC-supervised banks, Rohit Chopra, member of the FDIC board of directors and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in a Monday (Dec. 30) statement. Chopra said in the statement that very large investment managers like BlackRock and Vanguard own stakes both in commercial enterprises and in banks and that these firms often characterize their involvement with these companies as “passive.” “However, we know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners,” Chopra said. “If these firms are not truly ‘passive,’ they may be in violation of longstanding statutes, including those relating to banking.” Chopra’s statement came after the Friday (Dec. 27) release of an amended advisory opinion by the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, saying that large “passive” asset managers may not have a representative on the board of directors of a bank in which they have a significant ownership stake. In addition, the FDIC said Friday that it entered into an investor passivity agreement with Vanguard in which the agency has advanced tools to ensure that the company remains passive in terms of its ownership stake in FDIC-insured banks. Reached by PYMNTS, Vanguard said in an emailed statement that the agreement is part of its ongoing commitment to passive investing. “Vanguard is built around passive investing and has long been committed to working constructively with policymakers to ensure that passive means passive,” the statement said. “This agreement with the FDIC is another example and recognition of that ongoing commitment.” BlackRock did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. In his Monday statement, Chopra said the steps taken by the FDIC are “small, but significant” and advance the goal of ensuring that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” FDIC-supervised banks. “Agencies across government charged with safeguarding critical sectors of the economy from conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct will need to take further steps with respect to these large investment managers,” Chopra said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Is Amgen Inc. (AMGN) the Best Pharma Dividend Stock to Buy In 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth. Looking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape. As executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs. In addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges. Our Methodology In this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A pharmacist filling a prescription for a complex drug developed by the company. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) develops and delivers human therapeutics globally. Its key products address conditions like psoriasis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular risks, cancer, and anemia. Amgen is particularly appealing due to its undervaluation and strong pipeline, including the experimental obesity drug MariTide, which could significantly boost its valuation. Even without MariTide’s success, Amgen’s intrinsic value remains solid. This favorable risk/reward dynamic, combined with its strong fundamentals, makes Amgen a compelling choice, with the potential for significant upside as the pharma sector stabilizes. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is also 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) reported strong Q3 results with a 23% revenue increase to $8.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth in 10 products. Key drivers included a 17% rise in oncology sales, a 21% increase in rare disease sales, and a 67% growth in TEZSPIRE for severe asthma. Repatha and EVENITY also showed strong performance in general medicine. The company’s pipeline progress, particularly with the obesity drug MariTide, positions it for long-term growth. Biosimilars also performed well, with a 9% sales increase. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) returned capital to shareholders with a 6% increase in its dividend, paying $2.25 per share in Q2. For 2024, the company expects total revenues between $33.0 billion and $33.8 billion, with non-GAAP EPS ranging from $19.20 to $20. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be lower than Q3 due to planned investments in key assets like MariTide and olpasiran, as well as other strategic initiatives. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 database, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) was found in 68 public stock portfolios, compared to 69 in the last quarter. Two Sigma Advisors is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company. Overall AMGN ranks 8th on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMGN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fidelity lifts valuation of Elon Musk's X and xAI even higher
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/fidelity-boosts-valuation-elon-musk-x-xai-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:02:36Z
Full Content:
Fidelity has lifted its valuation of two Elon Musk-controlled tech companies even higher, according to recent filings. This was the second month in a row that the mutual-fund giant raised the value of its stakes in xAI and the social-media platform X, the filings show. The Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its xAI shares at $79,857,865 at the end of November, a monthly report posted at the end of December said. That's a 6.4% increase from October, when the fund valued its stake in xAI at $75,062,706, and an increase from September, when the value was $44,152,362. The fund's annual report, published at the end of September, said that at the end of July it owned 3,688,585 xAI shares, which were acquired on May 13 for $44,152,000. However, xAI recently closed a hotly anticipated funding round that Fidelity participated in alongside A16z, BlackRock, Kingdom Holding, Lightspeed, and other investors. xAI confirmed the $6 billion round in a blog post on December 23. It's unclear how many shares of xAI the Blue Chip Growth Fund has now, but previous filings showed that the price from September to October rose to $20.35 a pop from $11.96. Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund also increased the value of its shares in X in November to $5,797,734, according to the filings. That's about a 5% increase from October, when shares were valued at $5,530,358, and a 39% increase from September, when Fidelity valued its stake in X at $4,185,614. Musk's 2022 acquisition was panned as one of the most overvalued tech acquisitions in recent memory. But the deal has provided significant benefits for Musk. After using X to support Donald Trump's reelection, he's set to wield considerable influence in the incoming Trump administration. X has also been a lucrative source of training data for xAI, which has used content on the social-media platform to develop powerful AI models that compete with similar offerings from OpenAI, Google and other tech companies. But the X deal still hasn't worked out that well for investors, at least not yet. Despite two straight months of increases, Fidelity still values its X stake far lower than it did in late 2022, when Musk purchased X for $44 billion. Earlier filings indicate Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund at the time invested $19.66 million. Representatives for Fidelity declined to comment on Monday. Representatives for X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Correction: December 31, 2024 — An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported the number of times in a row that Fidelity has increased the value of its stake in xAI and X. The correct number is two months in a row. Jump to

Title: The Most Unhinged and Impressive Fandom Collabs of 2024
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-most-unhinged-and-impressive-fandom-collabs-of-2024-2000543677
Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:00:56Z
Full Content:
In the past decade or so geek culture has expanded into the mainstream with more inclusive ways to express your fandom love. Once only marketed through black t-shirts with logos slapped on them or collectible toys, merch has undergone a massive shift. In 2024, repping your fandom became even easier than ever before, thanks to collections inspired by sci-fi and fantasy worlds in nearly every conceivable fashion and lifestyle arena. Between all the bold casual cosplay, subtle streetwear, and even luxury makeup and perfume, there was constantly a collaboration in the wings waiting to go viral. That’s not even mentioning movie popcorn buckets which were also insane this yearâso much so they warranted their own post. This year also had some more daring moments with its mountains of fandom merch. Keep reading to see how things got way more experiential and experimental thanks to the stream of unhinged products and social media-driven events. View this post on Instagram There was a whole month of Nickelodeon celebrating SpongeBob SquarePants by doing “Krabby Patty Kollabs” at burger destinations nationwide, timed to the show’s 25th anniversary. But the Wendy’s version felt the most authentic to the show’s depiction of the type of burger you’d get in a fast food place under the sea, especially compared to the elevated foodie stunt versions (they were cool, but Mr. Krabs would never). Wendy’s brought back the square meat patty for the occasion, and that was genius; it hit double the nostalgia factor so I found myself ordering this one more often. Speaking of food, Deadpool & Wolverine did a pizza line (which is on brand for the merc with the mouth) with DiGiorno’s that had mixed results. It wasn’t the wildest of the Deadpool placements; there were also those Heinz ketchup and mustard bottles, and the bonkers bootylicious Xbox controllers. On the cuter side of things around Halloween, we got the Universal Monsters x Care Bears collection which mashed up the adorable bears with a spooky twist through classic bear plushes, Funkos, and makeup. The plushes are hard to find at their regular price points now, with third party sellers shilling them for questionable prices. I still covet the Creature From the Black Lagoon Bear. View this post on Instagram For Gen Z goths, Pottery Barn came out with a creepy cute Wednesday collectionÂ featuring a Nevermore dorm vibe. We were particularly tickled by the thought of the Thing shaped pillow, which sold out in a snap.Â While the above collection is very limited at this point, Dr. Martens still has some of its Wednesday capsule available online. Docs and The Addams family? The perfect match for any goth kid’s (and kids at heart) shoe collection. A post shared by Dr. Martens (@drmartensofficial) In the realm of beauty products, our favorite clever match came in the form of Rihanna’s Fenty x Arcane line inspired by the characters on the Netflix show. The very in-depth collection drew from the leads’ sense of style and power with a quality makeup capsule from our sci-fi dreams. View this post on Instagram Anime and fellow Netflix fave One Piece has been featured in a number of fun collections inspired by the Straw Hat Crew, but the most uniquely unhinged was the Casetify collab that turned tech accessory covers into the Devil Fruits from the show. Particularly fun were the Gum Gum fruit headphone cases. A post shared by CASETiFY Co-Lab (@casetify_colab) And for Cowboy Bebop fans, Logic dropped a collab with Crunchyroll featuring streetwear fits inspired by the looks of the anime’s characters and their signature iconography to make you feel like you fit into the world of the classic cartoon. While Deadpool & Wolverine dominated the shelves for the first half of the year, Wicked took over fall. There was an incredible range of pink and green at every price point, much of it seemingly aimed at Wicked fans who’ve been waiting 20 years for merch that goes beyond any online theater shop. Eighth grade me with the grey shirt that read “Defy Gravity” in the tiniest of green-printed letters would be shocked at how many Wicked things adult me got this year, and she’d also be very proud. Did I really need the Wicked x Con-Air hair rollers? Yes. Did I really drop an undisclosed amount of change for the Beis x Wicked luggage? Yes, I can use it for work travel. Do I stay up at night haunted by the fact that I was not able to get the Elphaba Stanley tumbler from Target? Yes, and I foolishly check at random hours for a re-stock because goodness knows the wicked’s lives are lonely.Â More Wicked merch is guaranteed to come thanks to 2025’s Wicked: For Goodâthough we’re all still waiting forÂ some sort of official meta “Holding Space for ‘Defying Gravity'” release. The end of the year has brought a few notable collabs that have left me intrigued at what 2025 will bring. Nosferatu came with the most absurd of all, including a vampire coffin bed that was more expensive than a limited edition Nosferatu coffin-coffin to be buried in. Plus, there’s also a Nosferatu fragrance collab with Heretic, for those who care to give off the scent of a ghost wandering through a flower-filled funeral parlor. View this post on Instagram Speaking of bats and the winter chill of the end of year holidays. Uno continues to release unhinged versions of the card game including a Batman: The Animated Series version with chaotic “Joker” cards for more card-slamming across the table. And Walton Goggins has pulled a Baby Billy Bible Bonkers with his own “Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses,” perfect for hitting the slopes despite the head-scratching reasons behind just why he came up with this, because the official commercial feels like performance art. (To be honest, we can’t wait for an official Fallout collab called “Walton Goggins Ghoul Goggle Glasses”). View this post on Instagram And Squid Game season two gets some deeply eyebrow raising collabs with McDonald’s in Australia. If fans buy an adult Squid Game Happy Meal they’ll get a shot at an exclusive McDonaldâs Squid Game Green Player Tracksuit or $100,000 if they can carve out their very own Dalgona candy and scan it into the MyMaccaâs App. Audiences stateside were a little baffled by the Domino’s Emergency pizza ad during their binges of the show because that’s some chilling late-stage capitalism tone deafness. There’s also official collabs with Puma with new track suits as well as shoes and a tech accessory drop through Casetify. At least with the former you can don gear that will identify your vote to end or continue the games if you were in it, but lets be realâwe’re all in the game.

Driven mostly by Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Japanese producer Ibiden is looking at methods to boost manufacturing capacity to satisfy rising demand for chip substrates vital for artificial intelligence computers. CEO Koji Kawashima made the statement while in an interview with Bloomberg. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Based in Ogaki, Japan, Ibiden provides specialized substratesincluding powerful graphics processing units from Nvidiathat are vital for producing artificial intelligence chips. Strong orders have driven the business to investigate capacity increases because, according to Kawashima, demand is projected to stay high until next year. Ibiden is building a new manufacturing site in Gifu Prefecture to handle these demands. By late 2025 the plant will start running at 25% capacity; by early 2026 it will rise to 50%. Talks on complete operating capability to satisfy consumer expectations are still under progress. Kawashima underlined the need of increasing output to maintain customer satisfaction and said that customers had already asked about next projects. Although Nvidia continues to be a major client, Ibiden has broadened its portfolio of business to include firms engaged in advanced computing technology. Once the biggest source of income for Ibiden, Intel now accounts for less of revenues. While stressing the need of lowering dependence on any one customer, Kawashima pointed out the historical significance of the link with Intel. Though rising sales of AI-specific devices, Ibiden recently changed its profit projection due to declining demand for server-related components in non-AI applications. Kawashima voiced hope for overcoming these obstacles by means of strategic alliances and creativity. Citing logistical and labor cost issues, the corporation has decided against building manufacturing plants located in the United States. As competition in the AI chip industry rises, Ibiden expects to be offering a wider spectrum of customers ahead. From established companies like Nvidia to startups with unique silicon designs, Kawashima pointed out the company's flexibility in fulfilling changing market demands.

(SMCI, Financials) ended a $50 million loan deal with HSBC's Taiwan unit, therefore creating even another level of financial difficulties for its operations. The business said that formally the loan, completely repaid on Sept. 9, was ended on Dec. 20. Reflecting investor uncertainty, Super Micro's shares fell 5% on the announcement. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Previously called the General Loan, Export/Import Financing, Overdraft Facilities, and Securities deal, the terminated deal provided credit to Super Micro's Taiwan affiliate. The company's future liquidity management comes under scrutiny as it has not stated intentions for a successor financing strategy. Amid these developments, Super Micro Computer keeps working with NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA, Financials) to improve its position in the artificial intelligence sector while handling continuous financial review. Emphasizing its dedication to improving artificial intelligence technology, the business has revealed three NVIDIA-powered generative AI SuperClusters, aiming at corporate and big language model applications. Announced earlier this year, the SuperClusters seek to clear key AI process bottlenecks like GPU memory capacity and efficiency. The development emphasizes Super Micro's strategic dependence on NVIDIA technology to support its AI offers, a move experts see as essential to maintain its competitiveness in the fast changing tech scene. Super Micro struggles financially, however. The firm postponed publishing its annual report in August, under investigation by short-seller Hindenburg Research for claimed possible accounting mistakes. October saw an escalation in the matter as Ernst & Young left their post as auditor due to internal control issues. Super Micro hired BDO USA as its new auditor to handle these issues and submitted a compliance plan to Nasdaq, which gave the business an extension until February 2025 to record missing reports.

Title: Nvidia may be entering a 'limitless' era: Investor

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia's (NVDA) Teflon-like stock may be taking a few swipes as the year winds down, but a new chapter awaits the AI market darling — and with it more impressive quarters of growth, experts and investors believe. "Nvidia is printing money like Apple did in the early days of the iPhone," Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management president Ross Gerber said on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above), later adding, "the opportunity for AI is somewhat limitless at this point." Gerber, who has been an investor in Nvidia for the past decade after it rose to popularity for its high-performance gaming chips, thinks the company is entering its "next leg" of growth. The growth is to be fueled by rapid global buildouts of artificial intelligence infrastructure, powered in large part by Nvidia's leading-edge chips. "Nvidia is not a highly expensive stock, but it's not a cheap stock," Gerber said. "But the actual profits that they're driving and their monopoly position in the chip business just puts the next five years looking really good for Nvidia." "I certainly wouldn't get off it now," he added. "So for investors, Nvidia needs to be a part of your portfolio just as much as Apple and Microsoft." The excitement around what lies ahead for Nvidia is captured in retail investor inflows. Nvidia has attracted $30 billion in retail investor inflows so far this year, according to data from Vanda Research. It makes Nvidia the most popular stock among retail investors in 2024, ahead of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), with $15.3 billion in inflows, and Tesla (TSLA), with $14.7 billion. Some traders have opted to get off the Nvidia rocket ship this month, however. Shares of the new Dow Jones Industrial Average component are up just 0.7% in the past month. The Dow is down 10% in the last month, while the S&P 500 has lost about 1.7%. Nvidia shares are still higher by 181% year to date. The stock is facing a soul-searching moment, according to Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya. This is related to several factors, including execution issues while trying to push through leading innovation and concerns around China exposure ahead of potential tariffs from returning president Trump. “Some of these [issues] are company-specific forces,” Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below), “and some of these are market forces.” The switch to Nvidia's Blackwell AI chip — which won Yahoo Finance's 2024 Product of the Year award — hasn't been seamless, Arya explained, and this has unnerved the bulls. “The last two quarters have not been clean because they are going through the growing pains from one generation of product to a new generation,” Arya said. Blackwell, which the company rolled out in March at its annual GPU conference, was hailed as Nvidia’s most powerful and innovative offering. However, bringing the completed idea in the form of a product to the masses has proven itself to be more difficult. “Since [March], what we have seen is execution issues keeping it out of the hands of customers,” he said. Now Wall Street's gaze will shift to success toward unleashing Blackwell into a market that is hungry for its offerings. Arya believes that Blackwell will rack up billions in sales in 2025. The stock could also see a near-term catalyst as Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage as a keynote speaker at CES 2025 in early January. Yahoo Finance data shows that sell-side analysts expect Nvidia to increase net sales by $65 billion year over year in 2025, with earnings per share more than doubling. "They're the only game in town," Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said on Opening Bid. The [AI] foundation starts with Nvidia. That is not changing." Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Report: BlackRock’s Record ETF Offering Helped Bitcoin Hit $100K
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/bitcoin/2024/blackrock-record-etf-offering-helped-bitcoin-hit-100000-dollars/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:18:43Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is reportedly a record-breaker, in more ways than one. The company’s iShares unit offers 1,400-plus ETFs, including its Bitcoin Trust, which launched this year, Bloomberg reported Monday, (Dec. 30). That trust, known as IBIT, now has more than $50 billion in assets, the strongest debut ever for an ETF, and the size of more than 50 European market-focused ETFs put together. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, per the report, adding that — at the current asset level and an expense ratio of 0.25% — IBIT can expect to earn around $112 million per year. IBIT’s success goes beyond BlackRock and helped mark a turning point for bitcoin, according to the report. BlackRock — the world’s largest investment firm — has more than $11 trillion in assets under management, so its embrace of bitcoin ETFs helped push the cryptocurrency’s price above $100,000 for the first time, the report said. This year began with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving bitcoin ETFs after years of opposing the idea. The move was cheered by figures throughout the cryptocurrency sector, including Sui Chung, CEO of Kraken-owned CF Benchmarks. “A spot ETF has always been important because it stands to open bitcoin up to a much broader swathe of investors,” Chung said in a statement to PYMNTS at the time. “We look forward to working with asset-allocators as they incorporate this new asset class into their portfolios and models, significantly increasing the number of investors who could have BTC exposure.” Coinbase, meanwhile, called the approval a “watershed moment for the crypto economy” on its company blog, saying the ETFs “will help catalyze further growth and innovation and expand the size and breadth of crypto markets.” This year has been momentous for cryptocurrency. “The changes of 2024 laid the groundwork for a more resilient and integrated crypto ecosystem,” PYMNTS wrote last week. “Regulatory clarity, technological advancements and growing institutional interest signaled that the industry was entering a new phase of maturity. However, achieving mainstream adoption will require continued innovation, collaboration and a commitment to addressing the challenges that remain.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Ethereum Price Declines Despite Record Staking And ETF Activity
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ethereum-price-declines-despite-record-staking-and-etf-activity/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:00:09Z
Full Content:
Recent Ethereum market swings have revealed an interesting disparity between price and network activity. Staking activity has kept rising while ETH retreated to $3,400, a 16% drop from its December peak. Due to investors staking record amounts of ETH, the total staked assets have exceeded expectations. Even while short-term price fluctuations have led some to doubt Ethereum’s viability, this surge in staking is a sign of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term worth. Another significant development is the increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are concentrated on Ethereum. The net total of $2.68 billion has been amassed over the past 25 days, with ETF inflows recorded on 23 days. On December 27, the total net assets of ETFs exceeded $12 billion as a result of the nearly $48 million in daily inflows, data from SoSoValue shows. The Ethereum ETF offered by BlackRock has garnered the majority of these investments, underscoring the institutional interest in ETH in defiance of the recent price decline. The popularity of Ethereum spot ETF reflects the larger crypto market, in which ETFs are starting to be a preferred choice for both institutional and ordinary investors. On the other hand, significant inflows of Bitcoin ETFs in recent months suggest that traditional financial markets are progressively welcoming digital assets. Ethereum’s price decline, on the other hand, illuminates an alternative narrative. Ether’s price drop is likely to be driven by profit-taking following its recent rally and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Regulatory pressures and concerns about the likelihood of another interest rate rise have accentuated the cautious mentality of traders. Despite the slump, some analysts see this as a time of consolidation rather than cause for worry. They note that Ethereum’s staking and ETF inflows are strong markers of long-term market confidence. Ethereum’s most recent advancements occur amid an atmosphere of optimism regarding its ecosystem. Continued attention is being drawn to recent enhancements, such as the transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements. These developments are enabling Ethereum to preserve its leadership in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s important for investors to keep a long-term view while also being able to handle short-term fluctuations. The changing nature of crypto investing can be seen in the growing use of ETFs and staking. The price of Ethereum may go up and down, but its network and use cases are still strong.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Why Is Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (AMLX) Among the Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) stands against the other best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. Goldman Sachs has spotlighted an often-overlooked sector poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs: biotechnology stocks. In a recent note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, highlighted biotech as an under-the-radar opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the Fed’s rate cuts. Flood noted that biotechnology stocks are uniquely sensitive to changes in interest rates as they often rely on projected future profits and are heavily impacted by the cost of capital. With little or no current profitability but significant upside potential, if clinical trials succeed, these stocks have an “option-like structure” that makes them particularly responsive to interest rate movements. The note also emphasized that biotech has recently seen improved fundamentals driven by positive clinical outcomes and a more favorable regulatory environment. Despite these tailwinds, biotech remains under-owned by hedge funds. According to Goldman’s data, the sector ranks in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year and just the 4th percentile over the past five years. Recent performance data supports Goldman’s outlook. The iShares Biotech ETF climbed 7.7% in Q3, outperforming the Nasdaq Biotech Index and more than doubling the S&P 500’s 3.2% gain over the same period. For investors anticipating a continued decline in bond yields, Goldman suggests biotechnology stocks may offer more attractive exposure compared to other rate-sensitive equity sectors, which are more dependent on broader economic growth trends.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 30, Stacey Sears, Portfolio Manager at Emerald Advisers, provided a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and investment opportunities in small and emerging biotechnology companies. Sears acknowledged that there has been a significant innovation in the healthcare industry, especially over the past 20 to 30 years, which was catalyzed after the decoding of the human genome in 2003, as it identified over 8,000 genetic diseases. This breakthrough provided a roadmap for researchers and scientists, leading to accelerated innovation in areas such as DNA and RNA editing and the development of treatments for orphan and rare diseases. Sears noted that small and emerging biotechnology companies have been at the forefront of this innovation. In 2023, approximately two-thirds of all clinical trials were initiated by small and emerging biotechnology firms, and about 56% of new drug substances approved by regulatory bodies originated from these smaller companies. Sears pointed out that the sector has been underperforming over the past couple of years. This underperformance is largely due to the inverse correlation between healthcare stocks and interest rates and yields. However, she noted that the sector is now starting to see a favorable shift. Clinical advancements have continued unabated, and the pipeline of new treatments and drugs remains robust. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing a patent cliff, estimated to be around $30 billion by the end of this decade as their drugs become generic. Small and emerging biotechnology companies are seen as key sources for filling this pipeline. This situation is creating a potential M&A tailwind, as larger companies look to acquire innovative smaller firms to bolster their drug pipelines. The biotechnology sector presents a unique investment opportunity, driven by favorable interest rates, ongoing clinical advancements, and increased M&A activity. Small and emerging biotech firms, in particular, are poised to play a critical role in addressing unmet medical needs and fueling innovation in the healthcare space.

To compile our list of the 12 best biotech penny stocks to invest in now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest biotechnology companies trading below the price of $5 as of December 26. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 26 Stock Price as of December 26: $4.00 Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions characterized by high unmet medical needs. The company has built a robust pipeline of promising therapies, including avexitide, AMX0035, and AMX0114. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is focusing on the advancement of avexitide, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist with both FDA therapy and orphan drug designations. Avexitide is being developed for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH), a debilitating condition that affects a significant portion of bariatric surgery patients. The company is on track to initiate a pivotal Phase III trial in PBH in the first quarter of 2025. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in reducing hypoglycemia events, with topline data expected in 2026. The positive results from earlier clinical trials, including a 66% reduction in Level 3 hypoglycemia events and a 53% reduction in Level 2 hypoglycemia events, provide a strong foundation for the Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is also focusing on the continued development of AMX0035, a novel therapy with potential applications in multiple rare neurodegenerative diseases. The company recently reported positive topline data from the Phase II HELIOS trial of AMX0035 in Wolfram syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy, and deafness. The trial demonstrated significant improvements in pancreatic function and other disease measures, providing a strong rationale for advancing AMX0035 into a Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) plans to meet with the FDA and other stakeholders to inform the design of this Phase III trial, with updates expected in 2025. Additionally, the ORION trial of AMX0035 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is recruiting well, and the company expects to share interim data in mid-2025. Overall, AMLX ranks 5th on our list of best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMLX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

U.Today - The crypto community carefully watches the blockchain space for large transactions, which reflect the current whale activity. According to Whale Alert, a blockchain sleuth that tracks down large cryptocurrency transfers, earlier today, a massive amount of Bitcoin was transferred by cryptocurrency whales. The post said that anonymous wallets had exchanged $361,584,691worth of Bitcoin — 3,856 BTC. In the comments thread, an X user pointed out at the mighty power of blockchain transfers, which cannot be beaten by bank transactions — the transfer fee for moving the $361.5 million in crypto comprised merely 0,00066 BTC, which equates to $61,57: “Thats the power of payment. You can pay this much for 2 usd fees.” Another commentator wrote that this potentially could be an over-the-counter (OTC) purchase/sale or a cryptocurrency exchange/whale restructuring their crypto wallets: “Large BTC transfer indicates potential OTC deal or exchange cold wallet restructuring.” Kiyosaki touched on several topics in it. The first was criticizing the boss of the world’s largest wealth management fund BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Larry Fink. Kiyosaki tweeted that Fink had begun to dump BTC, most likely referring to massive — close to $200 million — Bitcoin outflows by the company last week in a single day. Then the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author said that he would continue to buy Bitcoin, contrary to his earlier tweets, in which he claimed that once BTC surpassed $100,000, he would stop doing that. The world’s largest cryptocurrency soared above $108,000 in early December, but currently it is trading at slightly above the $93,000 price level. Kiyosaki believes that Larry Fink is suppressing the price so that whales are able to continue buying it. Financial guru Kiyosaki also doubled down on his ultra-bullish price prediction, made approximately a month ago. According to it, the investment expert sees Bitcoin soaring as high as $350,000 next year, largely thanks to a pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate winning the recent election.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other long-term stocks. To select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals. On December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a "barbell" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities. In the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year. Pettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 11.88% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is a global healthcare company that offers health insurance plans through its UnitedHealthcare segment, and healthcare services through its OptumHealth segment. UnitedHealthcare provides health plans for individuals, employers, and government programs. OptumHealth offers health services like pharmacy care services, health information and technology, care delivery, care management, and population health management. Its key growth driver is its strategic transition to value-based care, a healthcare delivery model that prioritizes improving patient outcomes and reducing costs by incentivizing quality over quantity. This is demonstrated by the company's significant investments in OptumHealth. In 2023, OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion, reaching ~$26 billion, driven by an increase in the number and type of care services offered and the patients served. Patients served by OptumHealth's value-based care models have shown improvements in key health metrics. For example, they are more likely to receive cancer screenings, have better control of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and are 10% less likely to experience emergency room visits or be readmitted to the hospital compared to patients in traditional fee-for-service models. UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s (NYSE:UNH) is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and continue to deliver strong financial performance. Parnassus Value Equity Fund finds an attractive investment opportunity in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a high-quality company with strong long-term growth prospects trading at a discounted valuation. Here's what the firm stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We purchased two new stocks, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Amazon. These are high-quality businesses facing temporary issues, which allowed us to purchase them at discounted valuations. The addition of UnitedHealth increases our small overweight to the Health Care sector. UnitedHealth benefits from secular tailwinds of an aging population, health care cost inflation and increasingly relevant use of heath care data/analytics. It also commands industry leadership when it comes to its extensive assets, vertical integration and deep management bench. Even though the stock has underperformed in the past year, we believe many of those factors have been priced in, positioning it well for growth in the near term.” Overall UNH ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A pharmacist handing out a pharmaceutical drug to a patient in a drug store or chemist. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 10.97% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing and marketing innovative medicines and therapies for several health conditions. It prioritizes R&D to discover new treatments for complex diseases and maintains a competitive advantage through its diverse product portfolio. Humira, a flagship drug for autoimmune diseases, was a top revenue generator for the company, reaching sales of $21 billion in 2022. However, in Q3 2024, Humira's revenues declined to $2.23 billion, a 37.2% year-over-year decrease, attributed to the loss of patent exclusivity in 2023 and increased competition from biosimilar drugs. Still, the total revenue for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) rose by 3.8% year-over-year. The immunology segment was a key driver of this growth, generating $7.05 billion in revenue, a ~4% increase year-over-year. The company continues to be a strong investment option for long-term investors. It maintains robust financial performance and consistently rewards shareholders with attractive returns. In its Q3 2024 investor letter, Polaris Global Equity Strategy discussed the strong performance of the US biopharma sector, with AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) demonstrating successful growth despite Humira's exclusivity loss. Here's what the firm had to say: “U.S. biopharma/biotech companies topped the health care sector, with the majority of holdings posting returns in excess of 10%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) showed positive top-line growth from its immunosuppressive drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Abbvie’s management continues to work through the loss of exclusivity from Humira, switching patients to Skyrizi or Rinvoq rather than Humira biosimilars.” Overall ABBV ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Today in Apple history: Microsoft hits the height of its ’90s power

Time Published: 2024-12-30T18:40:40Z
Full Content:
By Luke Dormehl • 10:40 am, December 30, 2024 December 30, 1999: Microsoft hits the height of its 1990s dominance and begins its early-2000s decline, clearing a gap at the top for Apple. After hitting an all-time high of $53.60, Microsoft stock starts to fall. Less than a year later, MSFT shares will fall more than 60% in value to $20. While I typically focus on Apple (and sometimes NeXT and Pixar) for “Today in Apple history,” it’s worth singling out Microsoft today because of what this date signified about the changing face of tech. In inflation-adjusted dollars, Microsoft’s market cap reached a high of around $850 billion at the time. It’s tough to think of a company that appeared more unassailable than Microsoft as 2000 approached. And yet, just 15 years earlier, Microsoft had been little more than a successful indie developer for the Mac. At a time when software could drive computer sales (still true today, but not to the same extent), the tide started to turn following Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ forced departure from Cupertino in 1985. A very bad decision made by Apple helped fuel Microsoft’s success in the ’80s and ’90s. In November 1985, Apple CEO John Sculley signed a deal with Bill Gates to give Microsoft “non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nontransferable license to use [parts of the Mac technology] in present and future software programs” for its fledgling Windows operating system. Apple’s determination to stick with a proprietary OS while Microsoft licensed Windows to third-party PC manufacturers set up a rough few years for Cupertino. After disastrous product launches and poor management decisions, Apple fell from power. Meanwhile, Microsoft gradually crept closer to matching what Apple was doing with Mac OS — most notably with Windows 95. By the time of Jobs’ return to Apple in 1997 with the company’s acquisition of NeXT, Cupertino appeared so far from a contender that Microsoft was willing to bail out the company with a $150 million lifeline as part of a deal involving Internet Explorer. Apple was said to be 90 days away from bankruptcy at that point. Within weeks of Apple debuting its 1997 “Think Different” ad campaign, marking Jobs’ vision for what Apple needed to represent, the Justice Department sued Microsoft in what became a long-running antitrust case. This wasn’t enough to topple Microsoft by any means. But it did coincide with a leveling off of the company’s influence. Not long after the December 1999 stock price high (which was aided by the dot-com bubble), Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO. Steve Ballmer took over the post. Then, as Microsoft struggled to maintain its relevancy in a new century, Apple released hit product after hit product. You know the rest. In addition to Apple, newer tech giants like Google helped fill the void as Microsoft’s dominance waned. In recent years, Microsoft’s push into cloud computing and its hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman boosted the company’s stock to new highs. It currently sits at No. 3 on the list of the world’s most valuable publicly traded companies (following Apple and Invidia). However, Microsoft does not possess the kind of world-dominating status it did at the turn of the century. How do you see things playing out over the next few years? Leave your comments below.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Encode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California’s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk’s injunction to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company. In a proposed brief submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Friday afternoon, counsel for Encode said that OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit would “undermine” the firm’s mission to “develop and deploy … transformative technology in a way that is safe and beneficial to the public.” “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. “If the world truly is at the cusp of a new age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the public has a profound interest in having that technology controlled by a public charity legally bound to prioritize safety and the public benefit rather than an organization focused on generating financial returns for a few privileged investors.” In a statement, Sneha Revanur, Encode’s founder and president, accused OpenAI of “internalizing the profits [of AI] but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,” and said that “[t]he courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.” Encode’s brief has garnered the support of Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the AI field and 2024 Nobel Laureate, and Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor and director at the Center for Human-Compatible AI. “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,” Hinton said in a press release. “It received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.” OpenAI was launched in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft. Today, OpenAI has a hybrid structure: a for-profit side controlled by a nonprofit with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees. But in a blog post Friday morning, the company said it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest. OpenAI’s nonprofit will remain but will cede control in exchange for shares in the PBC. Musk, an early contributor to the original nonprofit entity, filed suit in November requesting an injunction to halt the proposed change, which has long been in the works. He accused OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission of making the fruits of its AI research available to all and of depriving rivals of capital — including his AI startup, xAI — through anticompetitive means. OpenAI has called Musk’s complaints “baseless” and simply a case of sour grapes. Facebook’s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI’s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have “seismic implications for Silicon Valley.” Lawyers for Encode said that OpenAI’s plans to transfer control of its operations to a PBC would “convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders.’” Encode’s counsel notes in the brief, for example, that OpenAI’s nonprofit has committed to stop competing with any “value-aligned, safety-conscious project” that comes close to building AGI before it does, but that OpenAI as a for-profit would have less (if any) incentive to do so. The brief also points out that the board for the nonprofit OpenAI will no longer be able to cancel investors’ equity if needed for safety once the company’s restructuring is completed. OpenAI continues to experience an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said in a series of posts on X that he worries about OpenAI’s nonprofit becoming a “side thing” that gives license to the PBC to operate as a “normal company” without addressing potentially problematic areas. “OpenAI’s touted fiduciary duty to humanity would evaporate, as Delaware law is clear that the directors of a PBC owe no duty to the public at all,” Encode’s brief continued. “The public interest would be harmed by a safety-focused, mission-constrained nonprofit relinquishing control over something so transformative at any price to a for-profit enterprise with no enforceable commitment to safety.” Encode, founded in July 2020 by Revanur, describes itself as a network of volunteers focused on ensuring voices of younger generations are heard in conversations about AI’s impacts. Encode has contributed to various pieces of AI state and federal legislation in addition to SB 1047, including the White House’s AI Bill of Rights and President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL)’s Numbers Were Incredible, Stock Now Up 156% YTD

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Industrial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) stands against the other industrial stocks. As 2024 comes to an end, the flagship S&P index is up by 25.9% year to date, driven primarily by technology stocks and investors rushing to pile into artificial intelligence. Additionally, as opposed to earlier worries of a recession, the US GDP has continued to grow as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), America's economy grew by 3.1% in Q3. According to the IMF, the US GDP is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and stand out from most of the developed world and China. Yet, while technology stocks and the industry are eye-catching, they are not the only components of the economy. In 2024, while the overall economy has grown, some sectors haven't done well. One sector that's often perceived to be the pulse of the economy is the industrial sector. It measures output from large-scale plants, and in today's era of high interest rates, industrial stocks haven't done too well. For instance, while the broader S&P is up 25.9%, its industrial component has managed to post 16.94% in gains this year. The sluggishness in the industrial sector hasn't gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer either. On the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points but reduced 2025's projected rate cuts to two from an earlier four, Cramer commented on the state of the American economy ahead of the Fed's announcement. He outlined the need to look at other sectors apart from technology. "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks," said Cramer, adding "There are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn’t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!” Cramer wondered why the Fed was cutting rates at all since the economy appeared to be quite robust. He stressed the need to sift through the data to find out the real state of the economy. According to Cramer, "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that if you look at what we’re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it’s not strong either if you count colds.” The CNBC host wasn't convinced by the Atlanta Fed's estimate of the US GDP growing by 3.2% in Q4. He stated that he was "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Another sector that's representative of the broader economy and ties closely with industrial stocks is the automobile sector. Automotive firms often depend on the outputs of industrial firms, and if the industry is slow then industrial firms also face a demand slowdown. America's two biggest auto manufacturers, the firms behind the F-150 truck and the company developing the Cruise autonomous driving system, have both struggled in the stock market in 2024. The former's stock is down 17.5% year-to-date and the latter was up by a mere 10.5% by early August when investors were more uncertain about the economic outlook. Similarly, Elon Musk's car company had gained just 1.22% ahead of the election as its EV business continued to struggle with competition overseas and slow sales in the US. Cramer also commented on the trouble that the automotive sector is facing during the program. He was perplexed as to why "the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti." It's important to dig deeper into the automobile industry since it "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers,” Cramer commented. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about industrial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out industrial and materials stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an industrial equipment provider that primarily makes and sells electrical equipment. Its products are used across a wide range of industries such as utilities, energy exploration, and most important, data centers. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s utility and data center businesses have catalyzed the shares this year which are up by 156% year-to-date. The growth has come on the back of the firm's revenue growing by 45% in its fiscal year 2024. The stock soared by 26% after Trump's victory in the November election as investors expected Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) to benefit from lower regulation in energy exploration and a broader economic recovery. Here's what Cramer said in August: “Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn’t accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes? Overall POWL ranks 9th on our list of the industrial stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of POWL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than POWL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC, Financial) dropped 3% on Monday as investors are growing concerns over its long-term strategy, and leadership is primarily responsible for this. The company was recently struggling after CEO Pat Gelsinger left the job. That is where Iohaveny has left investors wondering about the path ahead for the company and its struggle to compete in the crowded market for chipmaking. Investors have fumed at Intel's slow progress in trying to recapture its leadership position and shift to focus on AI chips alongside its struggles in its foundry business. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with INTC. Operating a chip factory isn't easy, and Intel has been working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) on 3nm technology while making that step. And while these strategic shifts have yet to fully bear fruit, success has eluded short-term growth. Fierce competition from rivals such as AMD and NVIDIA continues to erode Intel's market share, increasing pressure to turn the Company's ship around in the ever-changing semiconductor universe. Forecasters say Intel can rebound by 2025 if it stabilizes its finances and copes with new product tablets. Nonetheless, it reflects growing investor sentiment that could continue as the stock's current decline reflects a tough 2024 outlook for businesses across all sectors.

Currently, shares trade at $70.29, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $22,522 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Agree Realty also paid dividends during these 10 years. Agree Realty's dividend yield is currently 4.32%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $23.47 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $7,520 from dividends alone.

Trending: During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses. “We are very pleased with our year-to-date performance as we have accelerated investment activity while strengthening our balance sheet through proactive capital markets transactions,” said Joey Agree, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During the quarter, we raised nearly $470 million of forward equity, contributing to record liquidity of over $1.9 billion. Given the continued strong performance of our portfolio and accelerating investment activity across all three external growth platforms, we are increasing full-year 2024 acquisition guidance to approximately $850 million and raising the lower end of our 2024 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $4.12 to $4.14.” Growth-focused investors may find Agree Realty stock attractive given the expected upside potential. Furthermore, they can benefit from the company's solid dividend yield of 4.32%. The changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.

US stocks declined on Monday as the tech sector's sell-off accelerated into year-end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered some of the morning's losses, down about 300 points around midday after falling by more than 500 points shortly after the opening bell. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also erased some earlier losses. The Nasdaq 100 has extended its mid-December decline to nearly 5% amid a rise in bond yields, while the S&P 500 has dropped by about 3% over the same time period. Yields edged lower on Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield down six basis points to 4.559%. However, the yield is up sharply since earlier in the month when it was hovering around 4.1%. According to Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton, the recent weakness in the stock market has flashed a technical "sell" signal. "The SPX posted a modest gain during the shortened week, but out intermediate-term indicators logged 'sell signals nonetheless, including the weekly stochastic and MACD," Stockton said, referring to two momentum-based technical indicators. Stockton said the sell signals increase the probability of a stock market correction in January. A slide in Boeing shares weighed on the Dow on Monday, with the stock down as much as 6% after a Boeing 737-800 plane crashed in South Korea on Sunday, killing 179 people onboard. For economic data this week, investors will watch the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index on Tuesday morning, followed by initial jobless claims on Thursday and ISM manufacturing data on Friday.

Title: Why The 60/40 Portfolio Needs Bitcoin In Today’s Market

Metallic Bitcoin symbol with financial chart over dark background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] selective focus and copy space. If you happen to be a Bitcoin skeptic, you’re not alone. A recent Pew Research survey found that 63% of Americans are not confident in the reliability or safety of cryptocurrencies in general. But when BlackRock speaks, it often pays to listen. In its just-released 2025 Global Outlook report, the world’s largest asset management firm lays out a case for Bitcoin not only as a diversifier alongside gold but also a strategic hedge against an environment where the historical stock-bond correlation is breaking down. For decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio—60% stocks, 40% bonds—was the gold standard of diversification. When stocks crashed, as they did during the dotcom bubble and global financial crisis, bonds usually rose in value, providing a cushion against market volatility. But we’re in a new regime now where this correlation has become increasingly unreliable. If you recall, 2022 was the worst year on record for U.S. stocks and bonds. BlackRock identifies this trend and suggests that investors need to look beyond government bonds for diversification. This is where gold and Bitcoin come into play. Both assets offer unique advantages as hedges and diversifiers, but they do so in different ways. Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier stems from its unique value proposition. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its demand is influenced by adoption trends, investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors. In the days following the November election, Bitcoin surged above $100,000, with its market cap topping $2 trillion—just under 2% of the total value of global equities. Bitcoin's market cap approaches 2% of global equities Last Thursday, Bitcoin tumbled 3.6%, falling back below $100,000, on the news that the Federal Reserve will approve fewer interest rate cuts than the market expected next year. BlackRock isn’t suggesting that Bitcoin should replace bonds in your portfolio. Instead, they’re recommending a modest allocation—1% to 2%—to capture its diversification benefits without significantly increasing risk. In fact, a 2% Bitcoin allocation provides a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla) in a balanced portfolio. Even though Bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below $2 trillion, it remains the seventh-largest asset in the world, ahead of Saudi Aramco and even silver. The global gold market, by comparison, is valued at $17.8 trillion—nine times larger than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s growth trajectory is undeniable. Before its price declined, it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. That’s roughly double what it was at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin doubled its value relative to gold in 2024 Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could match and even surpass gold’s $17 trillion market cap within the next five to eight years. That’s a bold prediction, but it’s not without merit. As more investors, institutions and nations adopt Bitcoin, its scarcity becomes more pronounced, potentially driving prices higher. While Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, Dogecoin has carved out a niche as a lighthearted, community-driven cryptocurrency with surprising staying power. Originally launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has since grown into a legitimate digital asset with a market cap in the tens of billions. Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its utility for microtransactions. It’s used mostly to tip content creators and foster online engagement. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an ideal currency for small, everyday payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has no hard cap, which helps keep its price stable for transactional use. Elon Musk’s longtime support of Dogecoin has contributed to its growing popularity. News that President-elect Trump plans to appoint Musk to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added to the speculation and excitement. Since the election, Dogecoin has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin since the U.S. election While it’s still seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin’s growing user base and real-world utility suggest that it might deserve a closer look from investors. There’s even talk of a Dogecoin ETF next year. BlackRock’s research makes a compelling case for a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. I believe this relatively small position can provide meaningful diversification benefits without exposing your portfolio to excessive risk. And as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, that modest allocation could deliver outsized returns. Remember, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. But so was gold during the 1970s when it was reintroduced to the free market after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. I’ve been in this game for decades, and what I know is that over time, volatility tends to decline as an asset becomes more widely adopted. Gold will always have a place in my portfolio as the ultimate store of value. But it’s also important to stay open to new opportunities. Bitcoin represents a new frontier in wealth preservation and growth, and even the most conservative investors can no longer afford to ignore it. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks fell on Monday, with the woes of the three major indexes continuing in the final week of the year as an otherwise strong 2024 comes to a close. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped more than 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.8%. Stocks moved lower as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) retreated from a seven-month high to hover near 4.55%. Stocks closed out last week with a Friday slide from Big Tech names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), with the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.5% and the S&P 500 down over 1%. The highly anticipated "Santa Claus" rally, which is statistically one of the most consistent seven-day positive stretches of the year for the S&P 500, has flopped thus far. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24, well above the typical seven-day average of 0.3%, according to LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist. In the current period, the S&P 500 is down nearly 1%. With just two days of trading left in 2024, markets are hoping to recapture the momentum of this year's gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 25% in 2024, while the Nasdaq has increased over 30%. The blue-chip Dow has risen a more modest 14%. In a separate development, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq announced trading will be closed on Thursday, Jan. 9, for a day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100 at his home in Plains, Georgia. Four days into the highly anticipated "Santa Claus" rally, which is statistically one of the most consistent seven-day positive stretches of the year for the S&P 500, the benchmark index is lower. But Wall Street strategists argue this doesn't change their stance much on 2025. Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the "fundamentals" that have driven the market rally remain intact. "If the fundamental story holds, we would be buyers of first half pullbacks in the S&P 500," Chronert wrote. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee agrees. "In our view, nothing has fundamentally changed," Lee wrote. "The change in character of markets (towards caution) started with the December [Federal Reserve] rate decision and the Fed forecasting fewer cuts in 2025 from 4 to 2 ...And incrementally, there has not been any real change." Shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) skyrocketed nearly 30% on Monday after billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who owns shares in both stocks, posted on social media that he expects President-elect Donald Trump to remove the companies from conservatorship. Ackman wrote on X that what makes these stocks interesting to him is "there is a credible path for their removal from conservatorship in the relative short term, that is, in the next two years." Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: One thing President-elect Donald Trump can probably count on next year is falling oil prices, thanks to growing global supply. “Demand is not the primary concern as global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 1.3 million barrels per day this year to 1.1 mbd next year ... Instead, the real challenge lies in the excess supply,” Natasha Kaneva, head of the Global Commodities Strategy team at JPMorgan, wrote in a recent note. Kaneva and her team predict Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, which is on track to average roughly $80 for 2024, will tumble to an average of $73 in 2025. The analysts point to incoming supply from large-scale offshore developments in Brazil, Guyana, Senegal, and Norway. Read more here. The broad-based rally seen in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has all but disappeared in the final month of the year. On Monday alone, 408 stocks in the index were underperforming the S&P 500. The S&P 500 Equal Weigh Index (^SPXEW), which isn't impacted by the movements in large stock like its market-weighted counterpart, can be one sign of the market rally broadening. If the equal weight index is outperforming the benchmark index, it shows many stocks in the index are participating in a given rally. The opposite has happened in December. The S&P 500 Equal Weight is on pace to have its worst month against the S&P 500 since March 2020, per Bespoke Investment Group. Nvidia (NVDA) stock reversed direction following a report from The Information that its customer, ByteDance, plans to spend $7 billion on its AI chips in 2025 despite US export restrictions on goods to China. Nvidia shares were up 1.8% midday after falling as much as 2% earlier in the trading session. Chinese TikTok parent ByteDance has reportedly been using Nvidia's Hopper AI chips in data centers outside of its home country to avoid US trade restrictions, which have ramped up under the Biden administration and are expected to further tighten under President-elect Donald Trump. It is unclear whether the $7 billion commitment from ByteDance represents growth in its spending on Nvidia GPUs from the current calendar year. Nvidia's gain Monday brings the stock into the green for the month after a sharp decline in mid-December. "NVDA shares have underperformed mega cap peers since June, but had very strong performance in 2024," D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday. "That means some investors may want to add NVDA as window dressing for their end of year reports, which should help the stock during the last two days of the year." All three of the major indexes were off their session lows around 12:30 p.m. ET on Monday. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) were all off by about 0.7%. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had been down more than 1.6% at one point in the day. An upswing in Nvidia (NVDA) helped the revival, as the stock, which opened lower on Monday, was up about 1.5%. US natural gas futures for February delivery soared on Monday, rising as much as 20% as demand for fuel rose amid expectations of a colder January. This marked the largest one-day move since the contract started trading in 2012, according to Bloomberg. The pop in natural gas spread to the equity market. Energy (XLE) was the lone S&P 500 (^GSPC) sector in the green, up about 0.15% on the day. Read more on the natural gas spike here. While stocks are slumping Monday, 2024 was still a year of records on Wall Street with the S&P 500 clinching 57 records to fall into the top five years for most all-time highs recorded by the benchmark index. Two years into the bull market, strategists pin the rally on strong corporate earnings and outsized momentum from several members of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, which include chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), along with Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META).

On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq announced trading will be closed on Thursday, Jan. 9, in observance of the National Day of Mourning. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Housing contract activity picked up again in November as buyers shrugged off elevated mortgage rates and took advantage of higher inventory levels. The Pending Home Sales Index, which tracks contract signings on existing homes, rose 2.2% from October to 79, its highest reading since February 2023, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). An index level of 100 is equal to contract activity in 2001. It’s the fourth straight month of gains. Pending home sales are up 6.9% compared to November 2023. “Consumers appeared to have recalibrated expectations regarding mortgage rates and are taking advantage of more available inventory,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were in the red at the open on Monday. The Information Technology sector (XLK), a key driver of the 2024 stock market rally, was off by about 1.8%, leading the losses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were all of more than 1% to start the trading session. Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wednesday as stocks continue to struggle during a historically strong period for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Since 1950, the S&P 500 has risen 1.3% during the seven trading days beginning Dec. 24, well above the typical seven-day average of 0.3%, according to LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist. History has shown that if Santa does come and the S&P 500 posts a positive return during the time period, then January is typically a positive month for the benchmark index and the rest of the year averages a 10.4% return. When the S&P 500 is negative during that time frame, January usually doesn't end in the green, and the return for the upcoming full year averages just 5%, per Turnquist. Three days into this year's Santa Claus period, which will close on Friday, Jan. 3, the S&P 500 is down less than 0.1% While history may be flashing a warning sign, it's notable that last year the Santa Claus rally didn't materialize. January started poorly too. Still, the S&P 500 is still set to end the year up more than 20%.

Title: Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) Showcases AI Advancements Amid Modest Revenue Expectations; Analyst Cites Concerns Over Pricing Model

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence has become a dominant force in the stock market, driving the performance of top companies and capturing the attention of major investors. Insider Monkey's Q3 data reveals that 15 of the 20 companies most favored by hedge funds are deeply involved in AI, reflecting its growing influence across industries. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include tech giants leading the AI revolution, remain the most widely held by hedge funds, highlighting their central role in shaping market trends. The AI boom continues to surge, fueled by companies not just adopting but spearheading advancements in this transformative technology. As valuations for AI-driven stocks climb to unprecedented levels, the sustainability of this rally comes into question. Can the sector’s rapid growth justify its soaring price tags, or is a market correction inevitable? Investors remain on edge, closely monitoring the balance between innovation and valuation. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the “AI computing ramp” as being in its early stages, with years of growth ahead, predicting AI-driven advancements in fields like science and healthcare. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz highlighted how AI is enabling both cybercriminals and cybersecurity efforts, calling it the future “battle of AI.” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy emphasized generative AI’s role in democratizing enterprise data, noting ongoing collaborations and a robust AI product pipeline. AMD CEO Lisa Su discussed the competitive semiconductor market, stating that different computing architectures are needed for AI’s diverse applications and stressing that AI’s full impact will unfold over the years. Lastly, Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld pointed to increasing power grid pressures due to AI-related technology demands, emphasizing the growing need for backup solutions for critical facilities. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. While AI is so far looking like a force for good, it is coming with its own challenges. According to the Bloomberg report, AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse, the U.S. power grid is facing growing challenges from "bad harmonics," which occur when electrical wave patterns deviate from the ideal. These distortions can damage home appliances, increase fire risks, and signal deeper grid issues. Data shows that households near data centers experience more severe harmonics, with over half of homes with the worst distortions located within 20 miles of major data center activity. In areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers dominate, the proportion of homes experiencing high harmonic distortions exceeds the national average fourfold. Whisker Labs, using a million residential sensors, reports that 1.7% of sensors nationwide exceeded the 8% distortion threshold, a figure that jumps to 6% in areas like Prince William County, Virginia, the report states. While some utilities dispute these findings, the data highlights how data centers, combined with aging infrastructure, electrification trends, and extreme weather, are straining the grid. As the electricity demand for data centers increases, Big Tech is looking toward nuclear fuels to meet the demand. For example, Reuters reported that Amazon has signed three agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) to address the growing power demand from data centers. One project, in collaboration with X-Energy, will be based near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state and aims to generate up to 960 MW, enough to power over 770,000 homes. The company is also funding a $500 million round for X-Energy’s SMR development, targeting over 5 gigawatts of capacity by 2039. These moves come as U.S. data center power usage is set to triple by 2030. It has also partnered with Dominion Energy for an SMR project in Virginia. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:CRM) incorporates AI into its CRM platform, providing tools for predictive analytics, customized customer insights, and workflow automation. These AI-powered solutions assist businesses in streamlining processes, forecasting results, and improving customer engagement across various sectors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff promoted the company's AI agents in a Yahoo Finance interview. In another Yahoo Finance interview, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria tempered expectations about their revenue impact. He noted that Salesforce’s proposed per-transaction pricing model could worry customers, as high usage might lead to unpredictable costs. While the approach may take time for customers to adapt, Luria believes it will likely contribute only modestly to revenue next year. This comes as Salesforce is projected to approach $40 billion in revenue, making the AI agents less impactful on its overall financial performance. Overall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks on investors' radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In 2024, both cutting-edge technology and the companies controlling it grew increasingly powerful, provoking euphoric wonderment and existential dread. Companies like Nvidia and Alphabet soared in value, fueled by expectations that artificial intelligence (AI) will become a cornerstone of modern life. While those grand visions are still far into the future, tech undeniably shaped markets, warfare, elections, climate, and daily life this year. Perhaps technology’s biggest impact this year was on the global economy. The so-called Magnificent Seven—the stocks of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—thrived in large part because of the AI boom, propelling the S&P 500 to new highs. Nvidia, which designs the computer chips powering many AI systems, led the way, with its stock nearly tripling in price. These profits spurred an arms race in AI infrastructure, with companies constructing enormous factories and data centers—which in turn drew criticism from environmentalists about their energy consumption. Some market watchers also expressed concern about the increasing dependence of the global economy on a handful of companies, and the potential impacts if they prove unable to fulfill their massive promises. But as of early December, the value of these companies showed no sign of letting up. Though not with the explosive novelty of ChatGPT’s 2023 breakthrough, generative AI systems advanced over the past 12 months: Google’s DeepMind achieved silver-medal results at a prestigious math competition; Google’s NotebookLM impressed users with its ability to turn written notes into succinct podcasts; ChatGPT passed a Stanford-administered Turing test; Apple integrated new artificial intelligence tools into its newest iPhone. Beyond personal devices, AI played a pivotal role in forecasting hurricanes and powering growing fleets of driverless cars across China and San Francisco. A more dangerous side of AI, however, also came into view. AI tools, created by companies like Palantir and Clearview, proved central to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza in their ability to identify foreign troops and targets to bomb. AI was integrated into drones, surveillance systems, and cybersecurity. Generative AI also infiltrated 2024’s many elections. South Asian candidates flooded social media with AI-generated content. Russian state actors used deepfaked text, images, audio, and video to spread disinformation in the U.S. and amplify fears around immigration. After President-elect Donald Trump reposted an AI-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing him on the campaign trail, the pop star responded with an Instagram post about her “fears around AI” and an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris instead. Read More: How Tech Giants Turned Ukraine Into an AI War Lab Swift’s fears were shared by many of her young fans, who are coming of age in a generation that seems to be bearing the brunt of technology’s harms. This year, hand-wringing about the impact of social media on mental health came to a head with Jonathan Haidt’s best seller The Anxious Generation, which drew a direct link between smartphones and a rise in teen depression. (Some scientists have disputed this correlation.) Social media platforms scrambled to address the issue with their own fixes: Instagram, for instance, set new guardrails for teen users. But many parents, lawmakers, and regulators argued that these platforms weren’t doing enough on their own to protect children, and took action. New Mexico’s attorney general sued Snap Inc., accusing Snapchat of facilitating child sexual exploitation through its algorithm. Dozens of states moved forward with a lawsuit against Meta, accusing it of inducing young children and teenagers into addictive social media use. In July, the U.S. Senate passed the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which puts the onus on social media companies to prevent harm. Most tech companies are fighting the bill, which has yet to pass the House. The potential harms around generative AI and children are mostly still unknown. But in February, a teenager died by suicide after becoming obsessed with a Character.AI chatbot modeled after Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. (The company called the situation "tragic" and told the New York Times that it was adding safety features.) Regulators were also wary of the centralization that comes with tech, arguing that its concentration can lead to health crises, rampant misinformation, and vulnerable points of global failure. They point to the Crowdstrike outage—which grounded airplanes and shut down banks across the world—and the Ticketmaster breach, in which the data of over 500 million users was compromised. President Joe Biden signed a bill requiring its Chinese owner to sell TikTok or be banned in the U.S. French authorities arrested Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, accusing him of refusing to cooperate in their efforts to stop the spread of child porn, drugs, and money laundering on the platform. Antitrust actions also increased worldwide. In the U.S., Biden officials embarked on several aggressive lawsuits to break up Google’s and Apple’s empires. A U.K. watchdog accused Google of wielding anticompetitive practices to dominate the online ad market. India also proposed an antitrust law, drawing fierce rebukes from tech lobbyists. But the tech industry may face less pressure next year, thanks in part to the effort of the world’s richest man: Elon Musk, whose net worth ballooned by more than $100 billion over the past year. Musk weathered many battles on many frontiers. Tesla failed to deliver its long-awaited self-driving cars, agitating investors. X was briefly banned in Brazil after a judge accused the platform of allowing disinformation to flourish. In the U.S., watchdogs accused Musk of facilitating hate speech and disinformation on X, and of blatantly using a major public platform to put his finger on the scale for his preferred candidate, Donald Trump. Musk’s companies face at least 20 investigations, from all corners of government. Read More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker But Musk scored victories by launching and catching a SpaceX rocket and implanting the first Neuralink chip into a paralyzed patient’s brain. And in the November election, his alliance with Trump paid off. Musk is now a prominent figure in Trump’s transition team, and tipped to head up a new government agency that aims to slash government spending by $2 trillion. And while the owner of Tesla must navigate Trump’s stated opposition to EVs, he is positioned to use his new perch to influence the future of AI. While Musk warns the public about AI’s existential risk, he is also racing to build a more powerful chatbot than ChatGPT, which was built by his rival Sam Altman. Altman’s OpenAI endured many criticisms over safety this year but nevertheless raised a massive $6.6 billion in October. Is the growing power of tech titans like Musk and Altman good for the world? In 2024, they spent much of their time furiously building while criticizing regulators for standing in their way. Their creations, as well as those of other tech gurus, provided plenty of evidence both of the good that can arise from their projects, and the overwhelming risks and harms.

Title: How To Get A Job At A Tech Startup

Dr. Kyle Elliott, tech career coach, interview coach, and trusted confidant to Silicon Valley's top talent via CaffeinatedKyle.com. The illusion of stability was once a major reason job seekers flocked to large tech employers pre-pandemic. However, if the Covid-19 pandemic taught us anything, it’s that these companies no longer offer the same level of stability many of us once thought they did. More than 150,000 employees were impacted by layoffs at tech companies in 2024, according to Layoffs.fyi. In other words, tech startups may actually be safer bets—or at least not any more risky—than big tech companies when it comes to job security. If you want to land a job at a tech startup, many of the job search strategies you deploy will be similar to those necessary for securing a role at a larger tech company (which I've also written about), but you’ll also need a clear understanding of how hiring is done, a willingness to take intentional risks and the ability to differentiate yourself from the crowd. Although networking is a critical component of any job search strategy, it’s particularly important when targeting roles at tech startups. This is because interview and hiring processes are often less structured and formalized at these companies, meaning hiring managers may be more involved in choosing who is interviewed and selected for jobs. In fact, decisions can often be made in a silo, with a single individual or a small group deciding who is selected for a role. This means you'll want to really lean into your network, and your network’s network, when you see opportunities arise if you want to stand the best chance possible of landing a job in tech. In the era of online applications, it’s easy to quickly apply for jobs while expending minimal time and energy. Unfortunately, these days the job market is saturated, and it’s your responsibility to find ways to stand out from hundreds or thousands of your fellow candidates; otherwise, you’ll blend in with the competition. Therefore, consider how you can step outside your comfort zone with your job search efforts. If you’re an introvert like me, this might look like reaching out to a classmate from college who works at your target company or attending an industry event, even if it feels awkward. Many of my clients have also turned to Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Fishbowl, and other social media platforms and communities to rekindle and build their networks. The key is to find intentional, and perhaps slightly uncomfortable, ways to differentiate yourself from fellow job seekers in order to get the attention of recruiters and hiring managers. Working at a tech startup often requires you to wear many different hats, which means hiring managers aren’t simply looking for someone who can do the job but also someone who can add additional value to the team and organization. Instead of merely describing how you’re qualified for the job on your résumé and in the interview, highlight what sets you apart from other applicants. In other words, why should they hire you over other professionals vying for the same role, and how are you communicating this throughout your job search? As a tech career coach, job seekers often ask me whether now is the right time to join a startup or if they should target a larger company. Many professionals previously believed that startup life was only viable for those who were major risk-takers without family or other responsibilities. But as the last several years have demonstrated, even established companies can be hit by large-scale layoffs, so joining a Fortune 100 giant like Microsoft, Amazon or Google doesn’t guarantee job security. Additionally, many tech startups are working diligently to embrace work-life balance and prioritize mental health. So if you're looking for a job in tech, it may be time to consider targeting a startup. You’ve got this!

Title: Intel’s wins, fails, and WTF moments of 2024

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The good news for Intel? 2024’s almost over. Our collection of the highs and lows of Intel’s 2024 will have you reaching for the brandy. They weren’t good. I mean, aside from some of Intel’s mobile chips, what exactly did it do right? Let’s put it this way: when your ex-CEO prays for your company after he was kicked out, it was a bad year. As we’ve done for other companies in the past, we’ve collected the best, worst, and head-scratching moments from the past year. Get yourself a hot mug of cider or a cold glass of egg nog, and sit down with as we recap Intel’s 2024. And hold on — it’s going to get bumpy. Intel’s year-long saga of mediocrity just would not go away. From a January advisory by RadTools through more intensive investigations that stretched through the summer, Intel’s latest 13th- and 14th-gen desktop chips were plagued by two questions: what was going on, and, more importantly, would my processor be affected? Eventually, Intel solved the problem of why desktop systems with both chips inside ran the risk of blue-screening: a combination of faulty microcode and elevated operating voltages that contributed to a bug known as Vmin Shift. But once the bug was identified, it needed to be fixed. And Intel ran through patch after patch to try to and finally nail down the problem, which lasted until September. Right now, there’s no way of telling if your CPU has been damaged — well, except for a crash, of course. Extended warranties helped, of course, but the reputation of Intel’s Raptor Lake architecture was irrevocably tarnished. Thank goodness Arrow Lake was waiting in the wings, huh? At least Intel’s Core HX mobile gaming processors succeeded, right? Well, sort of. The 14th-gen Core HX didn’t really offer that much more than the mobile 13th-gen Core HX did in terms of performance, and we all know that the combination of a Core HX and an Nvidia GeForce can product a howling dervish of a laptop. Intel As far as how the 14th-gen Core HX fared against the Ryzen 8000 mobile, reviews gave the edge to Intel in terms of single-threaded and multi-threaded performance, but handed AMD the crown in terms of power and battery life. The 14th-gen Core HX performed adequately, just without a whole lot of value. But it also offered AMD a chance to start stealing market share from Intel, which it eventually did. It’s not much of a win for Intel, but you have to take what you can get, right? Historically, Intel has commanded about 80 percent of the PC market. Everything that AMD never quite changes that equation. Except that in desktops, AMD is now approaching 30 percent of the desktop market. The Intel faithful may yawn and roll over, content that Intel would have to give up millions of PCs to AMD before it would lose its majority. But cynics may point at the deluge of bad Intel news and conclude that the market has decided accordingly. In notebooks, however, Intel has maintained the 80-20 ratio. At stake are millions of PCs set to replace older Windows 10 hardware that will go out of support in October 2025 unless customers buy some extra time. Intel these days is a big fat, target, and Qualcomm is taking aim. So far, however, it doesn’t seem like buyers are necessarily signing up to buy Windows on Arm PCs instead of Intel, surprisingly. (Mercury Research recently reported that combined Apple/Qualcomm Arm processor sales were 10.3 percent, flat with the quarter before.) That might be due to the unexpected success of Lunar Lake or just some old-fashioned arm-twisting under the table. Still, a Dell XPS 13 powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon? Embarrassing. A crappy result? Intel saved face, sort of. With Mediatek and powerhouse Nvidia rumored to be developing Windows-on-Arm processors, though, 2025 may be the year of the Arm PC. Intel tried to convince us that its first Core Ultra chip, Meteor Lake, would usher in a wave of AI PCs. And they did — but save for Windows 11’s Windows Studio Effects, they really didn’t do too much. So what was the NPU good for? Two things, apparently: to highlight that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform had an NPU that it was actually shipping, and to usher in the Core Ultra 200 / Lunar Lake, which finally had the horsepower to qualify as a Microsoft Copilot+ PC. If you bought into the AI hype with Meteor Lake, you probably ended up with a sour taste in your mouth. Mark Hachman / IDG At least for now, Copilot+ PCs offer just a handful of generative AI improvements within Windows 11. Recall, the feature expected to get customers slavering for local AI, still hasn’t officially shipped. Meanwhile, while both the Core Ultra 200 and the Ryzen AI 300 technically qualify for Copilot+ status, it’s only on paper. Both require Microsoft to issue Windows updates to enable Copilot+ features — though just one, Recall, has been enabled…and that’s just in preview. It’s still a huge mess. Complicating Intel’s NPU issue was the recognition that while NPUs were more efficient at AI than anything else, there was another PC component that could execute AI far better: the GPU. If you owned a PC with a GPU inside of it — especially a desktop — you already owned the most powerful AI engine in the PC ecosystem. The problem? Intel didn’t have one. ASRock / Amazon The delays between Intel’s first-generation “Alchemist” and second-generation “Battlemage” parts was so big that Intel essentially fell out of the desktop GPU market. Yes, Battlemage (in the form of the Intel Arc B580) is here, it rocks, and its $249 price point will prove to be a boon for cash-strapped PC gamers. But as of this writing both AMD and Nvidia are expected to release far more powerful next-gen GPUs at CES in January 2025, including Nvidia’s Blackwell/GeForce 5000. All either company has to do is decide to release a stripped-down version that competes with Intel on price, and Intel could be toast — though that is unlikely to happen until later in the year, if the competition is even able to compete with the Arc B580’s spectacular value. Another plus? Intel’s GPU driver issues are largely a thing of the past now. Let’s be real: Qualcomm is only competing against Intel. AMD is too. But Intel has to compete with both companies, on two different metrics: performance and low power. Lunar Lake, or the Core Ultra 200 series, is Intel’s response to the power-sipping Snapdragon X Elite. And Lunar Lake did very well, offering killer, competitive battery life with Qualcomm’s best. While the CPU performance was middling, Lunar Lake’s gaming performance certainly improved over the prior generation. Mark Hachman / IDG What was impressive about Lunar Lake was that it competed with the Snapdragon while also competing with the Ryzen AI 300 — and without any lingering compatibility issues associated with Windows on Arm. I think Matt Smith’s gaming review echoed my own conclusions: Lunar Lake should really be evaluated on a notebook-by-notebook basis, as the performance has been a little inconsistent. Overall, however, Lunar Lake debuted impressively. When you hold a post-mortem interview acknowledging that the Arrow Lake launch “didn’t go as planned,” you can’t help but call the chip a failure. “I will say that the performance we saw in reviews — to be very clear, through no fault of reviewers — was not what we expected, not what we intended,” Intel vice president and general manager Robert Hallock told Hot Hardware. Actual users could see even lower performance, too, as Intel’s testing assumed some tweaked settings. (It wouldn’t be the only time during 2024 that Intel was linked to some benchmark hanky-panky, either.) IDG Arrow Lake’s performance in gaming matched or declined compared to the 14th-gen Core chips, while not delivering amazing gains in terms of power consumption. Contrast Arrow Lake’s disappointing launch with AMD’s outstanding Ryzen 7 9800X3D chip — which obliterated Intel in terms of performance and power — and it was a miserable 2024 for Intel’s desktop chips. Part of my job requires me to test Thunderbolt docks for a living, and Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 have been quite successful. But Thunderbolt 5 hardware simply hasn’t been as widespread as I anticipated, and a bad first experience with Thunderbolt 5 left a sour taste in my mouth. There’s been a noted lack of Thunderbolt 5 docks, and laptop makers haven’t exactly rushed to include Intel’s discrete Thunderbolt 5 controller, either. Part of the blame must be left at the feet of Intel, which still hasn’t integrated a Thunderbolt 5 controller into a laptop chipset. Intel The other Thunderbolt flop of 2024 is probably Thunderbolt Share, a cool concept weighed down by licensing and just general unavailability. I’ve seen a couple of Thunderbolt Share docks, but few if any notebooks have adopted the technology. Intel has some work to do here. Let’s face it: 2024 was a pretty lousy year for Intel. Chip nerds had been circling the company for some time — persistent GPU delays, desktop chip problems, and suspicions about the value of AI swung enthusiast perception away from Intel to AMD earlier in the year. But on August 1, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers or so and (*gasp*) eliminate its corporate dividend. Wall Street painted a big red bullseye on Intel’s back and took aim. Public perception changed overnight. On Halloween, Intel pulled off a tried-and-true strategy: dump all of the bad stuff into a single quarter’s worth of results, losing $16.6 billion after charges on $13.3 billion in revenue. Intel’s stock price plunged. We didn’t know it at the time, but there would be further consequences, too. In 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, providing $280 billion for domestic chipmaking and related activities, of which $52 billion was specifically marked for manufacturing and research. According to this nice breakdown of the CHIPS Act funding by our friends at Computerworld, Intel is scheduled to receive $8.5 billion (now $7.86 billion, plus $3 billion in additional funding for participating in the Secure Enclave program as well.) That agreement was signed on Nov. 26, 2024. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (left) speaks with U.S. President Joe Biden during a tour of an Intel semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, on Wednesday, March 20, 2024. Intel That was great news for Intel and then-chief executive Pat Gelsinger. Free money! Subsidies to build out an American foundry business to rival Taiwan and TSMC! But it came with a catch: to receive it, Intel has to hold on to at least 50.1 percent of its foundry business or give up the funding. No problem, right? Well… Intel chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger took a risky gamble almost as soon as he took office: Regain Intel’s manufacturing leadership by jamming through five manufacturing process node upgrades in four years. If Intel can pull off manufacturing Panther Lake on its 18A process in 2025, it will have succeeded. Mark Hachman / IDG But Gelsinger also pledged to open a separate foundry initiative to manufacture chips, essentially becoming a competitor to TSMC. The problem? No one bought the concept. Wall Street grew impatient waiting for Intel to fill its foundry business, though Microsoft signed on in February for an 18A chip and the company has claimed other, undisclosed customers have signed checks. Now, who knows what the future holds. Should Intel have waited until after its manufacturing turnaround had been established to launch a foundry business? It certainly appears so. Meanwhile, Intel built several tiles within both Core Ultra chips at TSMC, rather than its own fabs, while collecting CHIPS Act checks from the federal government. Not a great look. As a cub reporter, I interviewed Gelsinger when he was in charge of Intel’s USB efforts. He oversaw the Intel Developer Forum. I’ve had a chance to ask questions off and on over the years, and liked the guy. But he never sat down for an interview with PCWorld, and now he’s gone. Learn your lessons, folks. Mark Hachman / IDG Gelsinger stepped down just over a month after a blistering Reuters expose pointed out his missteps, including ticking off TSMC founder Morris Chang, who called Gelsinger a “very discourteous fellow.” Insiders said that Gelsinger had a choice: retire or else. In my opinion, Gelsinger failed for two reasons: He missed the opportunity to challenge Nvidia in enterprise AI, and the Intel Foundry initiative hasn’t taken off so far. But resuscitating Intel’s process technology roadmap should pay off in a big way. The man bled Intel blue, no question about it. Now, the torch has been passed to Michelle Johnston Holthaus as co-CEO and head of the newly formed Intel Products business. Holthaus has sat down for an interview with PCWorld, so she’s off to a great start. Hope your new year is happier than Intel’s 2024.

Title: Is NatWest Group plc (NWG) Among the U.K. Dividend Champions for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions. In recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A person using a laptop to access a bank's online banking system. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 4.37% NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a London-based retail and commercial bank that offers mortgages, loans, credit cards, and related services. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported an attributable profit of £1.17 billion and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 18.3%. Customer deposits, excluding central items, grew by £2.2 billion, driven by increased savings across all three business sectors. The company expects to maintain a RoTE above 15% for 2024 and projects income, excluding notable items, to reach around £14.4 billion. In addition, total income, excluding notable items, increased by £182 million (5.1%) compared to Q2 2024, primarily due to growth in lending, deposits, and margin improvement. L1 Capital also highlighted this in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG): NatWest is the largest commercial lender in the U.K. (20% share) and the second largest U.K. retail bank with ~13% of all mortgages. We see NatWest as best positioned in the U.K. Banking sector to benefit from improving margin trends, with topline growth supported by a rebound in U.K. housing and economic activity. Moreover, with significant buybacks owing to a strong capital position, NatWest should see ~8% EPS growth p.a. over the next three years vs. ~2% expected growth for CBA. Although CBA enjoys a more dominant market position in Australia vs. NatWest in the U.K., it appears overvalued in our view as it trades on ~24x FY25 P/E (historical highs) compared to only ~7x for NatWest. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is delivering solid returns in 2024, surging by nearly 83% in the past 12 months. A significant portion of the company's success in the past year is due to the unusually high interest rates, which allowed the bank to achieve exceptionally strong returns on its loans. In 2024, the bank consistently kept its net interest margin—the difference between the interest it paid and earned—above 2%. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a solid dividend payer as the company expects to pay ordinary dividends amounting to approximately 40% of its attributable profit in FY24. Currently, it pays a semi-annual dividend of $0.1543 per share for a dividend yield of 4.37%, as of December 29. As of the close of Q3 2024, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG), up from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $33.8 million. Overall NWG ranks 3rd on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NWG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NWG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions. In recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of bottles of whisky and other alcoholic beverages from a winery. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 3.26% A British multinational alcoholic beverage company, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) ranks fourth on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The stock has dropped by nearly 13% over the past year, largely due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Diageo holds leading products in categories like scotch, gin, and vodka. Its large scale allows for substantial marketing investments, ensuring its brands remain prominent and difficult for competitors to displace. In addition, the company's size provides a strategic advantage, enabling it to acquire smaller competitors and increase their value before they become significant threats. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) reported positive FY24 earnings that were reassuring for investors. The company generated $20.3 billion in revenue, which represented a slight decrease of 1.4% compared to the previous year. The report also highlighted that Diageo either grew or maintained its market share in over 75% of its net sales across measured markets, including the US. Aristotle Capital Management, LLC made the following comment about DEO in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Headquartered in London, England, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a global leader in the alcoholic beverages industry. The company has a vast portfolio of over 200 well-recognized premium spirits (~80% of FY 2024 sales), beers (~15% and mostly Guinness) and other beverages (~5%) that are sold in nearly 180 countries. Led by its Johnnie Walker brand, Diageo is the world’s largest exporter of Scotch whiskey—its largest category at ~25% of sales—followed by other spirits such as tequila and vodka (~10% each). Diageo also owns a ~34% stake in the premium champagne and cognac maker Moët Hennessy (a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) has been gaining momentum due to its robust cash flow. In FY24, the company generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow and $2.6 billion in free cash flow, reflecting year-over-year increases of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. With this strong cash position, Diageo returned $1 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year and raised its annual dividend by 5%, bringing it to $1.0348 per share. The stock's dividend yield comes in at 3.26%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 26 funds held stakes in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared with 31 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $703 million in total. Overall DEO ranks 4th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of DEO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DEO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) the Best Dividend Growth Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks. Dividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term. Also read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In Historically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market’s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience. This resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "Ideally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can't always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that's when a stock is really interesting to me." High-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company’s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. 5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.51% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The Florida-based renewable energy company posted strong earnings recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.57 billion, a 5.6% increase from the previous year. The company had another strong quarter in renewable energy and storage development, adding about 3 gigawatts (GW) to its project backlog for the second consecutive quarter. Over the past four quarters, it has secured roughly 11 GW in new projects. Madison Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Oracle Corporation, Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. NextEra has continued to perform well given its strong position in the renewable energy space, increasing demand for power, its transmission capabilities, as well as a tailwind from lower interest rates.” In addition to its strong foundation, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has developed one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets worldwide. This segment has gained from the shift away from polluting carbon fuels towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Given the long-term nature of the power transition, the company is poised for continued growth over the coming decades. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a nearly 19% return to shareholders. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share on October 18, which fell in line with its previous dividend. In 2024, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 28 years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 10.5% in the past five years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 69 funds held stakes in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $2.47 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NEE ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While institutions own 40% of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 58% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-14-24 Performance Since Then: 31.56% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest eCommerce firm in the US and also a key player in the lucrative cloud computing industry. Its partnership with AI firm Anthropic has also allowed the company to establish a foothold for itself in the AI industry and access technologies for enterprise AI products provided through AWS. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the handful of firms that operate across all layers of the AI stack - from designing custom chips to providing end-use applications. The tail-end of November and the start of December have been great for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares as its Project Rainier supercomputer built using in-house Trainium chips will be used by Anthropic to train AI. Cramer was very optimistic about the firm in August: "We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Why investing for the long run, especially if you buy certain popular stocks, could reap huge rewards. The technology provides blowing-filling-capping solutions for water, milk, and juice bottles in beverage applications. The S&P 500 index is set to cap off a banner year. Investing in the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is generally a smart move as the index has historically returned an annual average of 9% per year with dividends reinvested, but other funds may beat the S&P 500. One of the best-performing ETFs of the last 10 years has been the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), up roughly 800% over that time span. Investors of all types can benefit from the power of dividend stocks. Although dividends are usually sought by those in or nearing retirement, those regular payouts can contribute mightily to your long-term returns wherever you are in your investing journey. In those times, recurring dividend payments can cushion a portfolio's returns and give an investor cash to reinvest while stocks are trading at lower levels. With the broader stock market indexes hovering around all-time highs, some investors may fear that a sell-off is creeping on the horizon in 2025. After all, equity prices have outpaced earnings growth, leading to a relatively expensive market. Investment management firm Vanguard offers several low-cost ETFs that target various themes and stock market sectors. Futures fall: The S&P 500 is set to undercut a key level after Friday's sell-off. Nvidia has a new buy point. Tesla deliveries loom. Apple is close to becoming the first company ever to reach $4 trillion in market value. Monitor these key chart levels. AMD shares are one of the few big-tech names riding a big decline into the final trading days of the year. Investors remain concerned that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates as aggressively as hoped in 2025. Lower rates help boost economic growth—and make buying new cars more affordable. Aside from the market move, there haven’t been any new analyst reports or price target changes to pin Tesla’s move on. Sign in to access your portfolio

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 16.25% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The firm has managed to position itself as one of the most important AI stocks in the industry after suffering devastating market performance in 2022 because of Mark Zuckerberg's focus on the metaverse. Now, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has shaped up as an important AI player because of its 3 billion+ user base which investors believe can be used to monetize AI and push services to consumers. The firm is already allowing advertisers to use AI tools to run campaigns, and its narrative depends on sustained AI monetization. Another major catalyst for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stock in H2 2024 has been a potential TikTok ban that could further grow its user base. Cramer was full of praise for the firm's AI division in August: "We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd! Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?" Overall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 25.75% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: How Return Of Capital Can Lead Closed-End Fund Investors Astray
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/29/how-return-of-capital-can-lead-closed-end-fund-investors-astray/
Time Published: 2024-12-29T15:36:00Z
Full Content:
Confused middle aged 60s woman in glasses getty The other day, we broke down how return of capital (ROC) can be both good and bad for investors in 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs). But in the case of high-quality CEFs, ROC is, contrary to what most people think, a good thing. Today we’re going to look at some real-world examples to explain how, in fact, return of capital can make up a large share of a fund’s returns. To do so, we’re going to go into five Nuveen funds, the Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX), Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX), Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX) and Nuveen Core Equity Alpha Fund (JCE). Except for JCE, which I’ll get to in a moment, these are all covered-call funds that hold the index to which they correspond, then sell call options on part of that index, to essentially “translate” volatility into income for investors. These four funds have strong records of doing this, with all but DIAX up over 100% in the last decade (DIAX, in orange below, is the laggard here, up 86.4%, largely because its index rises more slowly than those tracked by SPXX, BXMX and QQQX). Fund Performance Ycharts These types of funds have a place in a diversified portfolio as a way to collect income, especially since they yield 7.2% on average. That’s obviously much more than the paltry 1.3% the average S&P 500 stock pays, as of this writing. The funny thing about that big yield is that it tends to attract naysayers who will tell you that these funds are just charging fees and giving you back your capital, hence the vast majority of their returns are labeled as return of capital (see right-hand column below). Return of Capital Percentage SEC In BXMX’s case, 91.3% of the distribution is classed as ROC, while SPXX is a tad higher and QQQX is a tad lower, with DIAX far behind, at 69.5%. JCE appears to be the best of the bunch here, with 25.5% of distributions being ROC. To be clear, these funds are not just giving you back your capital, as their healthy profits over the last decade prove. We discussed the technicalities of this in Thursday’s article. Now I want to focus on using ROC as an investment signal for these funds. Already we can tell that ROC is not a useful signal, since DIAX has been the worst performer for a decade, but its ROC ratio is lower than those of BXMX, SPXX and QQQX. However, this doesn’t mean we should go to the opposite extreme and say more ROC is the sign of a good fund: JCE’s much smaller portion of ROC coincides with it outperforming all of these covered-call funds in 2024, with a 24.6% return year to date, as of this writing. The reason why JCE has outrun the rest isn’t down to the ROC amounts—it’s because, unlike the others, this is an actively managed fund, meaning management can buy and sell stocks as they see fit. So they can, for instance, lower the fund’s exposure to NVIDIA (NVDA) when that stock shoots up in price. That’s unlike QQQX, which needs to buy more NVIDIA shares as the stock rises in price and thus becomes a bigger portion of the NASDAQ 100, which QQQX tracks. That’s also why JCE has done better than all of these covered-call funds combined over the last decade, returning 179% versus the covered-call funds’ average 103.6% return. So we can see that one of the real keys to maximizing profits and income in CEFs isn’t obsessing over ROC, but instead focusing on indicators like portfolio quality, management and historical performance. This is especially true when we compare funds of different types: JCE is not a covered-call fund, so the nature of its profits to investors is fundamentally different from those funds, since income from selling call options is recognized as capital gains. What’s more, selling call options also means you’ll sometimes have stocks that are down in price be sold, or “called away,” resulting in the fund realizing losses that offset the capital gains it received from selling the call options. This is also why covered-call funds tend to underperform over the long haul, especially if they are more passively managed, as our four covered-call funds are. The key takeaway here is that if you’re shopping for a CEF, do yourself a favor and ignore the chatter about ROC, so much of which is misinformed and confused. In reality, ROC is more often than not an advantage, because it amounts to tax-free income for American shareholders. And that means using funds that maximize ROC can be a great way to offset gains elsewhere or to boost income without boosting your tax burden. That’s a great reason why, despite their slight underperformance, funds like QQQX and SPXX might actually give you a higher net profit than a fund that has a higher return on paper, like JCE.

Title: Why does Wall Street think Netflix stock will plunge 10%?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The holiday season is a time for deep reflection. And for me this year, that has meant reflecting on some of my favorite stocks and leaders to follow. Netflix (NFLX) has come to the forefront of my mind as the year winds down, in part after seeing Beyoncé ride out on a majestic white horse during one of Netflix's Christmas Day football games. Legend. "The game was a home run as far as they're concerned," Manhattan Venture Partners head of research Santosh Rao said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief (video above). "I think this was a great home run for the ad business that they have." Netflix hosted its first two NFL games that day, hot on the heels of the glitchy — but still enjoyable to watch — Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing spectacle in November. The other reason Netflix is on my mind is because the hotly anticipated Season 2 of "Squid Game" premiered on Thursday, and the characters in the pink jumpsuits and black face masks are dominating my X feed. The second installment has gotten mixed reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but people still tuned in en masse. Doing a little analysis in the wake of these events, it looks like Wall Street is still too bearish on Netflix — even with the stock up 86% year to date. Perhaps this group thinks Netflix is that young streaming company from years ago, burning money and raising debt to fund content investments. Here is the bearishness I am seeing in the numbers, compliments of data from the Yahoo Finance platform: The average sell-side analyst price target on Netflix is $838, 10% below current price levels. This is totally out of whack with a company that has demolished analyst profit forecasts at every stop in 2024. 44% of sell-side analysts rate the stock at Underperform or Sell. The average analyst earnings per share estimate for 2025 models Netflix only posting 20% earnings growth. The reality is that Netflix looks positioned for another monster year in 2025, which may win over more Wall Street skeptics and support another push higher in stock price. Netflix has not only arrived on the live sports scene — it has smashed the wall down. This likely means two things: First, the streaming movement around live events will accelerate further as legacy media continues to buckle and cut back more, and second, Netflix's ad dollars are locked in on a significantly higher trajectory. Just look at these numbers. More than 200 countries tuned in at some point during the Chiefs vs. Steelers game, according to NFL Media data. The game is the second-most-popular live title on Netflix to date. Additionally, 60 million households watched the Tyson vs. Paul fight. These are huge numbers that validate Netflix's investments in live sports — which includes the debut of WWE in January. "Given the success of the Tyson/Paul fight we expect Netflix to accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming, which further enhances Netflix's ability to offer households regular compelling content (juiced by the fact their competitors are now selling previously exclusive content to Netflix) = likely lower subscriber churn and greater ability to take price," Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote. Wlodarczak is Wall Street's biggest Netflix bull, with a $1,100 price target on the stock. Wlodarczak's call-out of price increases is important. In October, Netflix raised prices for basic and premium services by $2 and $3, respectively. The hikes will likely enhance sales and profits in 2025. With the live sports and events push underway (including a deal to broadcast the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031) and compelling traditional Netflix content such as "Squid Game" being churned out, it's inevitable the company raises prices again within the next 12 to 18 months. See more: Why Disney doesn't want to sell its TV network That will only enhance Netflix's impressive free cash flow story. Netflix will haul in close to $7 billion in free cash flow this year, according to analyst estimates. Pivotal's Wlodarczak thinks Netflix's free cash flow will reach $23.5 billion by 2030. Free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. A company hits the free cash flow mark by being profitable and prudently investing those profits into "stuff" like plants and equipment. The cash left over could then be used to further bolster the total return potential for investors by way of stock buybacks or dividend increases. Recall that from 2015 to 2019, Netflix had a negative cash flow of $10.5 billion. The company went free cash flow positive in 2020 with $1.9 billion in free cash as the COVID-19 pandemic fueled bumper profits, followed by a $132 million free cash outflow in 2021. But those days are over. Last year, the company brought in $6.9 billion in free cash after reporting $1.6 billion in free cash flow in 2022. And Netflix's free cash flow build will only allow it to feed its content flywheel at the same time that legacy media continues cutbacks. This is how competitive moats are built. In the end, Netflix could conceivably generate north of $25 in earnings per share next year — well ahead of current analyst estimates of about $23.81. Slap a premium price-earnings multiple on the stock of 40 times (it's currently at 38 times), and Netflix could have a path to trading above $1,000 a share in 2025. "I think [the stock is still undervalued] absolutely because there's still a long runway ahead," Rao said. "They're just getting into live sports, and there are so many other live sports they can get into." "They're going to pull people into their ecosystem," Rao continued, pointing to cricket and soccer as other opportunities for Netflix live sports. "So the [subscriber] growth is going to be strong. To a large extent, it's priced in, but there is a lot more to come ahead because they are the only game in town in terms of excellent streaming services and the broad breadth of offerings." Rao sees at least a 15% upside left in Netflix shares. Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Cellectis SA (CLLS, Financial), a pioneer in gene-editing technology, is generating excitement on Wall Street, as analysts believe there is about 400% upside potential over its current prices. The current price is only $1.41 per share, and this under-the-radar cancer therapy has caught the eye of eight analysts who average a price target of $7.00 with a range of estimates from $3.00 to a really bullish $11.00. The company is working on the TALEN- TALEN-based gene Editing and is developing its pipeline Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CLLS. Key indications in the allogeneic CAR-T portfolio are UCART22, which UCART20x22 will support for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, respectively. They have designed these therapies to be off-the-shelf solutions, seriously advancing the field of reducing the cost and complexity involved with cell therapy. To continue investing in their pipeline, Cellectis has engaged with AstraZeneca to deliver cell and innovative gene therapies. This agreement signified a strong technology prowess for the company to make discovery-aided breakthroughs in genetic research and treatment solutions. Analysts are optimistic due to the strategic positioning of Cellectis in the flourishing category of personalized medicine, which is rapidly gaining greater relevance in the global health landscape. Yet, like most penny stocks, such investment comes with certain risks using regulatory hurdles and clinical outcomes on successful trials. For risk-savvy investors, Cellectis is a high-stakes gamble in the gene-editing arena. As this develops and merges further in partnerships, the company might become very well positioned to revolutionize treatment for cancers and make its current valuation look like a bargain in the years ahead.

His company is showcasing the self-driving two-seater at several key locations across the United States in December, with plans to deploy the autonomous services in California and Texas in 2025. According to a report in Euro News, global EV sales surged in November, with a record-breaking 1.8 million units sold worldwide, overtaking the record set in the prior month by 100,000 units. China accounted for two-thirds of the sales during the month. Around 15.2 million EVs were sold between January and November, growing 25% year-to-date. The report stated a 3% decline in EV sales in the region comprising the United Kingdom (UK), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union (EU). With 280,000 units sold in November, annual sales for the region reached 2.7 million units. However, the UK is having an improvement in the second half of the year; sales have grown 17% from last year, driven by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. China is not only leading the EV market but is also on track to take over the global auto industry because of its massive and growing capacity. Earlier this month, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) highlighted that the country’s EV capacity will soon match its domestic auto demand, whereas China’s car production capacity is already half of the global demand for automobiles. It is projected to have a total output of 20 million electric vehicles in 2024, with production increasing between 4-5 million units annually, helped by heavy investments from Chinese firms to expand production. According to the New York Times, China also has the capacity to produce over 40 million internal combustion engine cars a year. India’s auto market is also seeing impressive growth, contributing significantly to the global market. Annual production of automobiles in the country stood at 25.9 million units in fiscal 2023. The thriving vehicle market has also resulted in a booming auto components industry, which has grown 11.3% during the first half of FY25, driven by strong demand for larger and more powerful cars.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is a technology and mobility architecture company that manufactures vehicle components and provides electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the automobile market. The company’s share price has lost over 34% of its value this year, primarily due to the downward trajectory in the broader automotive industry, including factors like a dip in electrification momentum, growing labor and raw materials costs, and geopolitical tensions. Despite challenges, APTV has managed to maintain robust margins, which is a testament to its operational efficiencies. On October 31, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Revenue stood at $4.9 billion, down 6% from last year, driven by lower volume production at select customers in Europe and China. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $778 million while operating income was posted at $593 million. Improved operational performance across business segments, combined with efficient management of expenses in the current fiscal year and effective cost reduction measures taken at the end of 2023 have helped the company increase its operating margin by 120 basis points year-over-year. Moreover, its Q3 2024 EPS of $1.83 per share was the highest ever, growing 41% year-over-year. APTV is confident about ending the year on a high by delivering strong earnings growth and margin expansion. The trend is projected to continue in 2025, with the company stating that it expects to pay dividends in the year and beyond. Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average share price upside potential of 43%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has considerably improved as well.

A classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is an Italian designer, manufacturer, and retailer of luxury sports cars. It also produces limited series and one-off cars. The company is active in around 60 countries and territories through its network of authorized dealers. Following his election victory, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase costs for automakers, due to their reliance on auto parts from these countries. While Europe has largely been absent from Trump’s protectionist policies, there are concerns the region might be next to face similar scrutiny. However, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) remains unfazed by the chatter. When asked at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York on December 10 whether the company would consider manufacturing cars in the United States, CEO Benedetto Vigna stated that Ferrari will always make its cars in Maranello, northern Italy, and that will not change even if tariffs are introduced. Morningstar analyst Rella Suskin believes that, unlike its competitors in the industry, Ferrari’s high-end clientele and exclusive market allow the company to absorb high tariffs by adjusting prices without considerably impacting demand. Its order book is already strong, and the sports car maker is planning to launch its first fully electric vehicle by Q4 2025. Ferrari’s financial performance remained robust. During its recent Q3 2024 earnings call on November 5, the company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in revenues to EUR 1.6 billion ($1.68 billion), with a net profit of EUR 375 million ($394 million). The company is seeing order book visibility well into 2026, driven by impressive order intake for the 12Cilindri coupe Spider, and the unveiling of the F80 Supercar. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Buy rating for Ferrari with an average share price upside potential of 16%. Hedge fund sentiment around the stock has also improved. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 36 hedge funds held a stake in Ferrari, up from 30 at the end of Q2. It is one of the best car stocks to invest in now.

Title: Investing.com's stocks of the year

Investing.com -- 2024 has been a year of significant market shifts, with some companies soaring to new heights while others faced significant headwinds. Investing.com has compiled a list of some of the year's most notable performers: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares struggled for the first part of the year, but that changed in November after the U.S. election, with Elon Musk having aligned himself with President-elect Donald Trump. Musk’s support on the campaign trail and his appointment, alongside Vivek Ramaswamy in heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has helped to boost Tesla's stock as investors look at it as a "Trump trade". In a recent note, analysts at Baird raised their target for Tesla to $480 from $280, based on strong growth prospects in the automaker, supported by cost reductions, new models, and favorable regulatory dynamics. “The stock has gained significant momentum and has several upcoming potential catalysts. We like the stock long term and would be buyers on pullbacks,” the firm said. A potential regulatory fast track for the Cybercab, the rollout of affordable vehicles, and Musk's ties to President-elect Trump has Baird bullish on Tesla’s outlook for 2025. With Bitcoin also surging following the presidential election as investors expect a favorable environment for the sector, cryptocurrency-focused stocks have also rallied. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) started its rally ahead of the election and is up nearly 400% (as of December 27) this year. The stock, seen as a bellwether for Bitcoin exposure, was driven by surging Bitcoin prices and the company’s continued commitment to its cryptocurrency holdings. Meanwhile, Coinbase (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:HOOD) also benefitted from the crypto resurgence, up over 58% and 216% this year, respectively. The sector’s stellar performance in recent months reflects a growing belief in the crypto market as Trump prepares to take office in January. Since August, Palantir has skyrocketed and is also up close to 400% this year, solidifying its place as one of the top performers. The company’s software solutions and growing adoption across government and private sectors have made it a standout in the data analytics space. Wedbush analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and $75 target for the company’s shares in a note, stating: “With AI spending expected to ramp significantly within IT budgets in 2025, we believe the Messi of AI Palantir is in a prime spot to continue expanding its pipeline/deal flow.” They added: “We believe Palantir has a credible path to morph into the next Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) over the coming decade with AIP leading the way as many on the Street continue to be huge skeptics of the Messi of AI." While the stocks above primarily rallied towards the end of the year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made significant gains between January and June. After a pullback, it moved higher once again between August and November and is up over 175% this year. Nvidia has continued to capitalize on the demand stemming from AI. The company’s strategic positioning at the forefront of the AI revolution made it an essential stock for growth-focused investors. Truist analysts said they are “incrementally constructive” on Nvidia’s AI dominance, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock and raising the price target to $204 from $169 in a note. The firm noted that the stock has “been a home-run investment over the last two years owing to a new wave of AI demand,” and they expect 2025 to be “another constructive year.” They state that “all relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” while they believe “NVDA will announce a client-side CPU during 2025, opening up an additional ~$35B TAM.” In contrast to the names above, Intel has seen its stock plummet by 60% year-to-date. Challenges surrounding the company’s health and outlook have weighed heavily on its performance. Intel has struggled to maintain its leadership in the global chip market, ceding ground to rivals like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia. The abrupt removal of CEO Pat Gelsinger marked a dramatic turn, casting further doubt on the chipmaker’s ambitious turnaround plans. In a research note, Wolfe Research told investors that the biggest issue facing INTC is that “they simply don’t have the scale to be an IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] any longer, and the possibility of getting help from TSMC is going to be very difficult." Earlier this month, it was reported that two Intel executives said a manufacturing spinoff is possible if a new chipmaking technology slated for next year does not succeed.

Title: Disney’s Biggest Disasters of 2024: From 'The Acolyte' to 'Mufasa' to ABC News

The Walt Disney Company saw its fair share of disasters in 2024, even as Hollywood’s biggest studio continued to wield enormous power across media and politics. Disney repeatedly attacked now-President-elect Donald Trump throughout the campaign cycle, resulting in a bad year for ABC News. The studio saw its biggest streaming show of the year flop with subscribers, yet another ominous sign for the Disney+ service. And Disney closed out the year with a major box-office bomb. For CEO Bob Iger, 2024 was something of a transition period as the company continued in recovery mode following two financially difficult years. Iger swung the ax yet again across multiple Disney properties, with layoffs at Pixar, ABC News, NatGeo, and more. Last year, Iger laid off 7,000 workers worldwide, or three percent of its workforce, as the company’s financials tanked. Disney can take solace in the success of its blockbuster sequels — Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine were the two top-grossing movies of the year. But for every Moana 2 that rakes in a fortune, Disney also lays a giant egg, further sullying the studio’s formerly sterling reputation. Here are Disney’s biggest disasters for 2024. The Acolyte With a budget that one estimate put at close to a quarter of a billion dollars, Disney’s latest Star Wars spin-off series aimed to be a streaming blockbuster that would help drive subscriptions. Instead, the series tanked with viewers and was canceled after just one season. Who’s to blame? Most critics pointed to its weak and pointless story, unengaging main actress Amandla Stenberg pointlessly playing two twins, and pointless virtue signaling (a coven of lesbian witches saying they are not welcome in the galaxy, the casting of a transgender actor in a supporting role, and showrunner Leslye Headland herself, who promoted the series as the “gayest Star Wars” ever). Disney+ Woes The Acolyte‘s failure is emblematic of the entire streaming service Disney+, whose original and exclusive content has not resulted in the market dominance Iger had hoped for. As the year drew to a close, headline after headline signaled trouble for the content platform. In September, Disney slashed prices for new subscribers to $1.99 a month, hoping to boost its Q4 numbers. This month, an ad industry expert reported that companies are pulling their dollars from Disney+ due to unimpressive subscriber numbers, and Disney was shut out on the streaming charts by Netflix, Amazon, Paramount+, and even Peacock. Mufasa: The Lion King In what was supposed to be a box-office slam dunk, this “live action” prequel to The Lion King opened to a hugely disappointing $35 million — way off from the already muted expectation of $50 million. The movie could still find its legs, but the opening was a catastrophe for Disney, which was hoping to turn The Lion King into its own movie franchise. ABC News The Disney-owned news network face-planted hard during the presidential campaign. First, debate anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis put their fingers on the scale in favor of Kamala Harris, resulting in a rigged match that was too obvious to ignore. Muir paid the price — his World News Tonight ratings tanked the week after the debate. Then, host George Stephanopoulos stepped in it when he defamed Trump on-air, resulting in a more than $15 million settlement. The Bob Iger wing of the Trump presidential library is going to look grand. Looking Ahead As 2025 approaches, Disney is readying to launch one of its biggest titles: Snow White, starring Rachel Zegler, opens in less than three months. In February, Pixar will release its first-ever TV series, Win or Lose. Both projects have made major changes to appeal more to non-woke audiences. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

In CY24, they have not been let down by any of them. All delivered positive returns in the calendar year, with equities topping the list. As far as the long-term performance is concerned, small- and mid-cap stocks top the chart in 2024 and outperformed the other asset classes. The accompanying chart exhibits the relative long-term performance of the most liquid financial asset classes accessible to Indian investors. We considered large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, gold, silver, US equities, Chinese equities, long-term debt and short-term debt and, computed the five-year returns at the end of each year for the last ten years. The assets were picked based on investment options available for Indian investors via direct investing or mutual funds/ETFs. Overall, when looking at long-term performance, mid-caps outperformed large-caps and small-caps in terms of consistency and relatively better returns. In the last five-year timeframe ended 2024, the Nifty Smallcap 250 Total Return Index (TRI), which represents small-cap stocks, produced a compound annualised return of 30.6 per cent, while the mid-caps as represented by Nifty Midcap 150 TRI, delivered a return of 28.3 per cent. The domestic equities market demonstrated stellar show after the pandemic, despite short-term turbulences. Trivesh D, COO Tradejini says, “However, this stellar performance may not carry forward into 2025. Market dynamics indicate that growth across segments is likely to moderate, with mid-single-digit returns being a realistic projection. Large caps may continue to provide stability but face valuation pressures, while mid and small caps could witness uneven performance due to slower earnings growth and heightened regulatory scrutiny”. Over the last 15 years, mid-caps have consistently outperformed large-caps and small-caps in the majority of timeframes, as the table illustrates. Over the last two years, US equities delivered better returns compared to the large-cap stocks in the domestic market. This growth has been largely driven by the ‘Magnificent 7 ’ — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — backed by strong earnings and major investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Further rupee depreciation has boosted 5 year returns for an Indian investor. For example, while the last 5-year CAGR of S&P 500 total returns (including dividends) is 15 per cent in USD terms, it increases to 19 per cent in INR terms. “In 2024, the US market has become much more balanced,” said Pratik Oswal, head of passive funds at Motilal Oswal AMC. The 450-490 companies that had not performed well last year have also recovered in 2024 and demonstrated better returns, he added. Macroeconomic factors such as the US Federal Reserve’s policy rate cut rate and the likelihood of more in the offing, and the easing of the rate of inflation have been favourable factors, leading to a resurgence in US stocks, Oswal said. After three years of underperformance, Chinese stocks came into the limelight thanks to the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government in October 2024. The policy measure announced were aimed at supporting a weak property sector, increase retail consumption and boost capital markets. A China-focussed ETF trading in India returned 29 per cent this year, although 5-year CAGR was flat. The years 2018–2022 were not so good for the domestic fixed income markets, due to multiple headwinds. However, things changed over the last 18-20 months due to few factors including significant FII (foreign institutional investors) inflows into Indian government bonds and expectations of a rate cut cycle. Devang Shah, Head Fixed Income, Axis Mutual Fund, said, “For 2025, we believe the RBI will cut rates, driving performance of bond markets. We expect a 50-basis points rate cut in the next six months. The reasons for this would be slower GDP growth, as seen in the lower Q2 GDP, with Q3 and Q4 also expected to be lower. This would prompt the RBI to change its course and start cutting rates”. Your asset allocation plan should include debt funds since they may act as a buffer when other asset classes decline. Gold, as an asset class, is used as a store of value and a hedge against stock market volatility amid economic uncertainties. Despite short-term blips, gold prices have been on the rise since October 2022. The yellow metal has delivered a solid CAGR of 14.4 per cent over the last five years in rupee terms. Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions led to a significant surge in gold price. Chirag Mehta, CIO, Quantum AMC said, “The surge in gold prices is anticipated to persist into 2025, with the trajectory expected to be influenced significantly by the return of President Donald Trump to office, which could herald a series of policy changes and strategic decisions.” Expected rate cuts by major economies and persisting geopolitical tensions could also lead to a significant surge in gold price he added. While the gold has been the mainstay of investors’ portfolio for years for diversification into commodities, the silver has also gained traction among investors. Silver is a key component in solar panels and other renewable energy technologies. The increasing demand for these technologies has driven up the demand for silver. Manish Banthia, CIO Fixed Income, ICICI Prudential AMC said, “The outlook for silver in 2025 is shaped by two key factors: its relationship with gold as a proxy in the precious metals space and its industrial demand dynamics”. The year 2025 presents a challenging macroeconomic environment in the United States, characterized by elevated debt levels and a substantial fiscal deficit. Gold, traditionally seen as a hedge against risk, is likely to benefit from these uncertainties, and this positive sentiment could extend to silver, given its dual role as a precious and industrial metal Banthia added. Secondly, the ongoing surge in power sector investments and electric vehicles (EVs) investments continues because of new age applications demand for silver may remain robust. Should these trends persist, silver’s industrial value will likely remain strong Banthia explained. Silver, in rupee term, delivered a CAGR return of 13.7 per cent in the last five years. However, gold outperformed silver over long run in most time frames, as the table illustrates. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: What US buyers (and investors) can expect from the auto industry in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This year was a mixed bag for the large automakers, with sales in the US climbing and prices holding steady for the most part. But changes are coming for the industry — whether on the domestic front with a new administration or the threat of cheaper, foreign competition. S&P Global Mobility projects US sales will hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.2 million units in 2025, an estimated increase of 1.2% from a projected 16.0 million units in 2024, which S&P says still reflects an uncertain environment for auto sales in the US. "Vehicle pricing levels are expected to decline but remain high; interest rates are expected to shift further downwards, but inflation levels are anticipated to remain sticky, and new vehicle inventory should also progress, but careful management is expected too,” said Chris Hopson, manager of North American light vehicle sales forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, in its 2025 report. With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from major automakers in the US next year, starting with the big three. Click here for Yahoo Finance's Tesla 2024 year in review and 2025 look ahead. The biggest of the Big Three experienced a strong 2024 with robust sales of its generally higher-priced vehicles, like trucks, SUVs, and EVs. GM (GM) shareholders were rewarded with the stock up 25% for the year, buoyed by GM’s aggressive accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs, a type of buyback. GM announced a $6 billion ASR in June of this year, following a $10 billion ASR in November of 2023. After a Q3 in which GM said it took market share, the rest of the year was set up for success. GM said its inventory stood at around 627,000 vehicles entering Q4, which is around 50 to 60 days of supply entering a typically busy holiday period, and incentives in Q3 were 4.5% of average transaction price, which the automaker said was 2% below the industry. New EVs are coming in 2025, with the Cadillac Vistiq, Optiq, Escalade IQ, and Chevrolet Bolt EV. This comes after the company refreshed the Chevy Equinox and Traverse, GMC Acadia and Terrain, and Buick Enclave. But GM might have some issues with its EVs if the tax credit goes away under the Trump administration. “If those EV models, specifically for GM, because they made some launches that are doing fairly well in the past three months — if they're not eligible for tax credits next year, it is going to impact their ability to scale and ultimately our growth assumption,” S&P Global autos sector lead Nishit Madlani told Yahoo Finance. Despite a strong year, the company had some late-year surprises, like a $5 billion write-down in China and a wind-down of its Cruise robotaxi business. Investors will be keeping an eye on those two stories as 2025 progresses. GM’s archrival, Ford, is coming off a good sales year too. But all has not been well for the Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker. The company had to scale back its profit outlook for 2024 due to supplier issues and is still losing billions of dollars in its EV business. The company canceled an upcoming three-row EV SUV and pushed back the opening of a new EV plant, opting to focus instead on smaller EVs for the future, such as a compact-style pickup it says is coming next decade. With the cash cow F-150 pickup and Expedition full-size vehicles updated in 2024, Ford’s 2025 will consist of updates to the Mustang and Ford Transit commercial van along with the release of the $300,000 Mustang GTD supercar. The company has seen sales jump for its hybrid offerings like the Maverick pickup, F-150 hybrid PowerBoost models, and Escape CUV, and will continue to shift production toward those units. Wall Street is looking for better execution from Ford as well as cost discipline. “There are indications that the profit story for them is not trending in the direction we had expected a year ago, when we raised them to investment rate,” Madlani said. “They had some warranty costs. They had some supplier stability issues that we haven't seen at other automakers. So that's why there's some questions internally around execution from the management team there as well.” Ford will give a full update on its EV business outlook and profitability in the first half of 2025. The situation isn’t much better at Stellantis, which has Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, and others in its portfolio. A management shake-up will bring a new CEO in 2025 and a revamped plan for its automobiles and trucks. The delayed EV push for the automaker will see changes as well, with gas-powered cars joining the ranks of EVs, which will share the same platform. This comes after sales slumped for the automaker, with inventory building up and dealers having to slash elevated prices to move vehicles off the lots. “We’re grinding through a transition,” CFO Doug Ostermann said following the release of disappointing Q3 sales. For 2025 the company has promised lower prices for its existing models, like Jeep SUVs, with the addition of engine choices like V6s and V8s for customers who did not want to see those powertrain choices go away. And new models are on the way too. In terms of new product launches, the all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona is coming with a gas-powered version as well, an all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S is on the roster, and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger range-extended hybrid pickup will be pushed forward to 2025, jumping ahead of the all-electric Ram REV EV pickup. It should be noted that the Ram trucks were supposed to arrive in 2024. While S&P’s Madlani notes Stellantis has seen some improvement in terms of inventory management, there are deeper issues to work through, such as its mismanagment of production and demand in the first place. S&P ratings has a negative outlook on Stellantis at the moment. The world’s largest automaker — and the Big Three's biggest competitor — is having a banner year in the US, with year-to-date sales through Q3 up 5.5% and its “electrified vehicle” sales up a whopping 58% year to date. Powering those electrified sales are its Camry hybrids, RAV4 hybrid crossover, and even the new Tacoma that comes in mild hybrid form. And, of course, the Prius — the hybrid king that came to US shores 20 years ago is still setting the pace for hybrid sales. This year, Toyota went all out in the US with an all-new Camry and Tacoma pickup, two of its major volume sellers. It also relaunched the Landcruiser SUV and brought out minor updates to the Corolla, Sienna, and Crown, to name a few. Coming in 2025 is the new 4Runner, a midsize go-anywhere SUV with a devoted following that will be coming with — you guessed it — a hybrid powertrain. Toyota says hybrids are what Americans want, and pickup and SUV offerings like the Tacoma and 4Runner will cater to that demand. One note of caution for Toyota is the coming merger of Honda and Nissan. While the situation won’t likely change much in the near term (with the deal looking to close in 2026), it will allow the two Japanese automakers to match Toyota in size. “There is potential for a merged company to be better prepared to address the competitive threat from the newer players, as well as to be more competitive with Toyota,” S&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley said in a note published earlier this month. Germany’s Volkswagen (VWAGY), once the crown jewel of the country’s automotive sector and formerly the world’s No. 1 automaker, had a rough year. The company’s slump in important regions like Europe (with threats of a major labor strike averted for the time being) and China is a major problem, and development difficulties with its in-house software and EV development have led to costly delays. The situation in China, once a top region for the company, isn’t going to get better anytime soon, even with a new joint venture partner coming. However, the US region has actually improved, with sales growing for the Atlas SUV, Tiguan crossover, and even Jetta sedan. Meanwhile, the company’s sole EV offering — the ID.4 — has seen sales cut by half in Q3, and the ID.Buzz van just went on sale, with a costly starting price of about $60,000. Another concern: There are no hybrids on offer at the moment in the US, a big miss considering their popularity. VW says the upcoming all-new Tiguan in 2025 won’t have hybrid power until 2026 at the latest, which is a concern as it is VW’s top seller in the US. The full-size Atlas won’t get hybrid power until 2026, either. VW’s big bet on electrification remains with EVs at the moment, which could be a tough sell. With most of its current models updated or refreshed last year or this fall with the 2025 model year, VW does not at the moment have anything big planned for next year. In fact, VW’s biggest new push in the US is with Scout Motors, its wholly owned startup that will make EV and hybrid versions of SUV and pickup adventure vehicles using Rivian tech. But those vehicles won’t be in showrooms until 2027 at the earliest, which means VW will have to power through with its current portfolio through 2025 and beyond.

Title: bl.portfolio in 2024: Preferred prudence over popularity, rationalism over exuberance

It is no different for us at bl.portfolio. Here, we take this annual ritual very seriously as we are in the business of giving ideas for your hard-earned money. In the world of investing, no one can predict the markets with certainty but what we can do is prefer prudence over popularity and rationalism over exuberance. That has always been our credo and in the same spirit, we curated our product every week this year. Here is an honest report card of all we did 2024: Caution has been the watchword in our approach to and writings on the equity markets in 2024. On the back of the nearly 20 per cent rally in the markets in 2023, our equity outlook for 2024, published on January 7 , set the tone saying that while there was no case for pessimism, there was ample case for caution this year. Our stance emanated from the market valuation at the beginning of the year (23.8 times trailing) being above long-term averages as well as heightened optimism on earnings growth. In this firm belief, even as the markets raced to their all-time highs well into the year until end-September, we gave more hold/sell/book profit calls on stocks (44) as against buy/accumulate (31). Looking back, we stand vindicated, with the markets now 10 per cent below the September peak and India Inc faced with a consumption slowdown, a slow pick-up in private capex as well as a cooling off in earnings growth. In our assessment period for our stock calls (July 2023 to June 2024), we gave 117 calls across the primary (42) and secondary markets (75). About one-third of the sell /book profits/avoid calls have worked for us, prominent among them being the calls on telecom and IT players such as Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers, Tata Communications and Birlasoft. With Nifty IT up 23 per cent this year on the back of last year’s 22 per cent, book profit calls on stocks such as HCL Tech haven’t worked well. But we continue to remain watchful on IT stocks, as we believe the rally has been driven by valuation multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. Our book profits call on PSUs such as Power Grid and NHPC worked well too, but calls to take money out on IRFC, RVNL and Mazagon Dock, though backed by sound fundamental arguments, were given a bit early, in hindsight. These stocks have eventually seen corrections since the September market peak. Reiterating our cautious views on overvalued PSUs especially in the defence space, we highlighted the significant risks in holding on to these stocks, despite their growth potential. In our edition dated July 7 , we had noted why the stocks trading at obscene valuations would be unable to ‘avert a painful retreat when market cycle attacks with a vengeance.’ It was near-perfect timing given the significant fall in defence stocks since then. Our article on the underlying factors driving the PSU rally published on May 11, 2024, is one of the top-read articles this year from the bl.portfolio section on our website. That said, half of our well-researched ‘buys’ this year (six in 11 calls) have outperformed the bellwether and the broader markets. These include value-picks NCC, KNR Constructions and UTI AMC, international pick Alphabet as well as Godrej Agrovet and Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In-house expertise on international investing is our USP, but we do admit we have been very choosy this year due to our conservative stance. Apart from the call on Alphabet mentioned above, we recommended a partial book profit on Meta Platforms in February 2024. Investors would have made 5x returns from our earlier buy recommendation in our November 2022 edition in a 14-month timeframe on this stock. This year, we also consciously covered special situations such as buyback, open offers, buyouts etc. to give more actionable ideas to investors on their existing shareholdings. The call to tender the shares at ₹10,000 in the Bajaj Auto buyback citing the massive rally and the valuation expansion has worked well, with the shares now trading 11 per cent below. Ditto with the ‘subscribe’ recommendation to the Grasim Rights issue, which has paid off. On the other hand, we found that we did not see much success with ‘accumulate’ and ‘hold’ calls. Only six of our 20 ‘accumulate’ calls (Nippon AMC, Caplin Point Labs being examples) provided opportunities to accumulate on dips. We also found that the 15 ‘hold’ calls (expected to perform inline with the markets) didn’t work for us. But it is better to err on the side of caution. On the fixed income side, at the beginning of the year , we were very clear that while rate cuts may or may not happen in India in 2024, interest rates have peaked and that investors should make the best of the rates available. We found both the short-end and the long-end of the yield curve attractive and recommended bonds/mutual funds at these ends. Fast forward to end-2024 and 10-year G-Sec yields have dropped to 6.79 per cent from 7.21 per cent a year ago and a similar pattern can be seen across maturities. Investors have thus benefitted from a rally in bond prices this year. Keeping in tune with our cautious stance on equities as well as the expectation of a peaking out of interest rates, we carefully showcased options in categories such as balanced advantage, equity savings, multi-asset, ultra short-term as well as gilt/long-duration funds in our weekly ‘Fund Call’ space in the mutual fund section. For the risk-averse investors, we also recommended safer FD options across tenures from banks and NBFCs whenever attractive options came up. If you bet on gold as a diversifier this year, you would not be disappointed. Post gold’s decent 13 per cent upside in 2023 to end at $2,063 an ounce, we had predicted it to touch $2,200 this year (technical analysis) in our annual outlook published on January 14. We further followed it up with a more bullish case for gold in our article ‘Goldilocks moment for gold’, published on March 17 , as it neared $2,200 in early March. At that point, expectations of US Fed rate cut amidst some uncertainty on whether inflation battle was actually won or not, geopolitical turmoil in West Asia, Russia-Ukraine war and high government debt and fiscal deficit levels in developed countries, made the case for gold too good to ignore. Gold went on to hit a high of $2,790 in October this year. Although it has cooled off marginally from those levels, investors who had taken a cue from our writing would have been solidly rewarded. Rupee depreciation, too, has added to gains for investors in gold in India, offsetting some of the impact of customs duty cut in the July Budget. While we have been receiving your feedback regularly through mail or social media, 2024 has been a landmark year for brand bl.portfolio in terms of making an on-ground connection with readers/investors. Towards this, the first of the ‘bl.portfolio Investor Conclave’ was held in Coimbatore in June with a presentation followed by a panel discussion with various experts on the topic of retirement planning. This event was extremely well-received and enabled us to understand the mindset of our audience. There is a plan to do more such events especially in tier-2 cities in the coming year. With bl.portfolio being entirely behind paywall on our website, online subscribers are a lifeline. To reach out to them, we initiated subscriber-exclusive webinars this year. We have so far done one on US investing and another on the market outlook for 2025 is being planned soon. Our in-house technical analysis has a great following and to add value to these readers, we commenced our YouTube Shorts video series for the ‘Today’s Pick’ column (BL Today’s Pick: Stocks to Buy or Sell) this year. Our Nifty Prediction Weekly Video series, which has a big fan base, crossed a milestone of 100 episodes in March this year with 139 having been completed so far. This year, we also experimented with guest stories written by readers based on their personal investing experience. SEBI’s report on F&O trading put out in late September gave us this opportunity. Reader response to our call was overwhelming and at the same time, heart wrenching as well. We carried a few stories with their permission to help the larger investor community take away important lessons. As the New Year dawns, bl.portfolio will see new leadership at the helm. I step down after what has perhaps been the best four-and-a-half years both for the product as well as for me, professionally. The structural changes and demands that the pandemic brought about has seen team bl.portfolio grow from strength to strength in this period and am glad that I have been able to do my bit. The show will go on and if you are looking for best parking places for your money, fresh and unbiased perspectives await you in 2025 too, at bl.portfolio.

Title: 5 A.I. Trends to Watch in 2025: Agentic A.I., 3D Models, Synthetic Data and More

In the first eight months of 2024, Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) collectively recorded a staggering $125 billion in A.I.-related capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating costs, according to a September JPMorgan report. The cumulative CapEx of these four tech giants alone is expected to soar past the $200 billion mark for the entirety of 2024. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. A.I. startups, meanwhile, received unprecedented amounts of funding from investors eager to cash in on the technology’s lucrative potential. OpenAI is set to finish out 2024 as the most well-funded A.I. company, most recently valued at $157 billion. Its rival Anthropic is gearing up for new fundraising that cold value it at $40 billion. Flush with cash, leading A.I. companies are now tasked with the challenge of proving to investors—and the public—that their pricy bets on the new technology will pay off. From an ongoing pivot into “agentic A.I.” to emerging new scaling laws and wide-ranging explorations of A.I.’s myriad capabilities, here’s a look at what 2025 will bring to the world of A.I.: The buzzword refers to autonomous A.I. assistants able to complete tasks without human oversight. The potential of A.I. agents to enhance workplaces and everyday life quickly caught notice in Silicon Valley, with companies like Salesforce embracing agents as their next major product. Microsoft, too, has rolled out a slew of A.I. agents in recent months. In November, it unveiled several A.I. assistants customized for its Microsoft 365 suite, including an agent able to provide translation in nine different languages. OpenAI is also on the “agentic A.I.” train, with an upcoming model expected to be able to perform tasks like booking travel and writing code. A.I. agents are “the thing that will feel like the next giant breakthrough,” said Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, during a recent AMA on Reddit. The global market for A.I. agents is currently valued at more than $5 billion, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. By the end of the decade, this figure is expected to soar to $47 billion, driven in part by demand for agents amongst enterprise clients. One of the key components of A.I.’s success in recent years has been the mass amounts of data fed into A.I. models. But there’s only a finite amount of text, images and videos on the internet. To avoid a plateau in the technology’s development, A.I. companies are turning to alternative ways to train their models. One of the most promising solutions is test-time compute, where A.I. models improve by reasoning and taking longer to think about potential answers before responding—a theory most recently demonstrated by OpenAI’s o1 model. On an earnings call in November, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang described OpenAI’s new model as “one of the most exciting developments” in scaling and noted that “the longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.” Huang isn’t alone in his optimism. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also pointed towards test-time compute as a new scaling law in November, while OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever earlier this month highlighted it as a progression of A.I.’s pre-training era. Another solution to A.I.’s data crisis is replacing traditional data with information generated by the technology itself. The market for synthetic data is expected to skyrocket to $2.1 billion by 2028, representing an over 450 percent hike from 2022, according to BCC Research. Altman hinted at the potential of synthetic data a year ago when discussing A.I.’s dwindling data supply, remarking in an interview that “as long as you can get over the synthetic data event horizon, where the model is smart enough to make good synthetic data, I think it should be all right.” OpenAI, alongside competitors like Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft and Google, have all reportedly begun using synthetic data in some way to train and fine-tune models. In October, the A.I. startup Writer unveiled a new A.I. model trained entirely by A.I.-generated data. The approach allowed the company to cut significant costs in developing the model, which totaled at a mere $700,000 in comparison to the millions doled out by other companies. OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, for example, cost more than $100 million to train. Until now, much of A.I.’s visual outputs have remained two-dimensional, something tech pioneers are looking to shift in the coming years. “Large world models” are an emerging form of A.I. that aims to build interactive three-dimensional scenes advancing the worlds of movies, games and simulators. One of the largest players in this space is World Labs, a new startup established by Stanford A.I. pioneer Fei-Fei Li that raised $230 million earlier this year. The venture is looking to build large world models with “spatial intelligence,” a form of intelligence that understands and interacts with the real world. To demonstrate this concept, Li has previously used the example of a cat reaching out to topple over a glass of milk and humans’ ability to predict the consequence of this event and therefore take action to prevent the glass from falling. At the beginning of December, Google DeepMind launched its own large world model in the form of Genie 2, which simulates virtual environments that will be used to train and evaluate A.I. agents. The area will likely be a key focus for the lab going forward, as evidenced by its recent hiring of Tim Brooks, a former OpenAI researcher overseeing its video generator Sora. In an X post welcoming Brooks to his team, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis noted his excitement at “working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality.” Google has long had a seemingly untouchable dominance on the search market. But with the advent of A.I., a proliferation of A.I.-powered search engines is looking to shake the tech giant’s foothold. Not that Google hasn’t embraced the technology itself. In 2024, it rolled out AI Overviews, a feature that provides users with A.I.-generated summaries rather than links. CEO Sundar Pichai predicts the feature will attract more than 1 billion users monthly users and is already “increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction,” he told Wall Street analysts in October. But Google will have to contend with an increasingly crowded industry for search tools, as companies like OpenAI and Microsoft expand into the arena with the help of A.I. Meta is also reportedly preparing to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine, while the startup Perplexity AI has emerged as an especially formidable player. Recently valued at $9 billion, its A.I. search tools already process around 20 million queries on a daily basis, up from 2.5 million at the beginning of 2024.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper’s Long-Term Stock Pick: Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stands Out
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-david-tepper-long-term-123743807.html
Time Published: 2024-12-28T12:37:43Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other long-term stock picks of Billionaire David Tepper. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management is a multi-billion dollar hedge fund that was co-founded by billionaire Carolina Panthers owner Tepper in 1993. The fund was initially launched with a focus on distressed debt, which Tepper had years of experience in following a seven-year run as a credit analyst and head trader at Goldman Sachs. Appaloosa quickly built a name for itself on the backs of those distressed equities and Tepper’s aggressive investment style, returning 57% within its first six months of operation and has delivered impressive compound returns of greater than 25% since inception. It was managing $800 million in assets within five years of launching, which has since grown to $16.8 billion as of late 2023. That figure would be much greater if not for the fact that Tepper began transitioning his fund into a family office in 2019, beginning the process of returning money to outside investors. By 2022, nearly 90% of Appaloosa’s assets were owned by either Tepper, his family, or Appaloosa employees. Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio contained just 38 long positions heading into the final quarter of 2024, and was valued at $6.73 billion, up from $6.18 billion at the end of June. The fund added four new positions to its portfolio during Q3, while unloading three former holdings. Tech stocks held a dominant position in the fund’s portfolio for the third straight quarter, accounting for 38.5% of its value. The fund also had significant exposure to both communications and consumer discretionary stocks, at 24.6% and 23.1% respectively. Appaloosa’s exposure to various sectors was markedly different just five quarters earlier, when tech stocks accounted for just 7.1% of its 13F portfolio, while energy and utilities stocks came in at 15% and 21.7% respectively. The fund also had much greater exposure to healthcare stocks at that time, which accounted for 9.2% of its portfolio value, compared to just 2.4% at the end of September 2024. Of particular note is not just the sector allocations of Tepper’s fund, but also where those stocks originate from. Appaloosa’s top two stock picks are both Chinese stocks, as are 4 of its top 12 equity holdings. The fund has also built a stake in a major Chinese large-cap ETF. The bulk of those China-based additions to Appaloosa’s portfolio have come within the past five quarters, just ahead of major stimulus initiatives and economic policy shifts by the Chinese government that have helped spur in a rebound in the world’s second-largest economy. In a September interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Tepper noted that despite some recent gains in Chinese stocks, they are still trading significantly below past valuations and at just single-digit earnings multiples despite double-digit growth rates. He contrasted that to the S&P trading at a 20+x multiple to highlight the ongoing attractiveness of Chinese stocks. Tepper added that the Chinese government has exceeded expectations when it comes to its stimulus plans, which should bode very well for the Chinese economy in the months and years to come. Given Appaloosa’s highly concentrated portfolio and the relatively short timeframes with which it overhauls its holdings, there is notable value in focusing on those stocks that the fund has held on to for several years. The following data is gathered from Appaloosa Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). That’s why you should pay close attention to this important indicator. Note: All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ active funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2024 reporting period. Value of Appaloosa Management’s 13F Position (9/30/2024): $417 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders (9/30/2024): 284 Ranking second on the list of Appaloosa’s top long-term holdings is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has had a place in the fund’s 13F portfolio since Q1 2020. The fund cut its stake in the tech giant by 18% during Q3 to 970,000 shares, with the stock ranking as its fourth-largest position overall. Hedge fund ownership of Microsoft was flat during Q3 and has dipped by 9% over the past year. Some investors are worried that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s lead in cloud services and generative AI is wilting, which has forced it to boost its genAI-related capital expenditures. While that could drag down free cash flow in the near term, the investments are expected to begin paying dividends in the second half of the company’s fiscal 2025, when new capabilities are rolled out for Azure. Barclays predicts Microsoft’s Azure growth will accelerate in the second-half of FY25 to between 31% and 32%, while UBS is even more bullish, projecting 34% year-over-year growth. Loop Capital predicts that Microsoft’s free cash flow will still grow at a strong CAGR of 18% through FY27 despite the capex constraints, before accelerating to as high as 40% growth in FY30. The firm has a $550 price target on Microsoft. RiverPark Large Growth Fund expects continued double-digit revenue and EPS growth for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) according to its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): MSFT was a top detractor in the third quarter following a fiscal fourth quarter earnings report that featured inline operating metrics but mixed guidance. Positively, the company reported strong revenue (+15%) and earnings growth (+10%), powered by Azure (+30%), and operating margins of 43%. Guidance however calls for lower than expected fiscal first quarter Azure revenue as infrastructure constraints limit growth, and higher capital expenditures throughout the company’s fiscal 2025 to alleviate these constraints. The company expects growth to reaccelerate in the back half of fiscal 2025 as more AI capacity comes online. Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd among Billionaire David Tepper's 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans. This crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. 💰 Aly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes… but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one. Also: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is Thousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem. This ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. 😮 I'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.) Low key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. 🍿 That said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's. If you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. 👋 I'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Also: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator I've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. 🚀 Needless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses. BTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts. All that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. 😅 The TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. 😤 Here is the recap: Deadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension). Consequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned. Reason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government. TikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment. The irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. 🙃 On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban. Also: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning In response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban. As of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain. In addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. 😱 TikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. 😳 Meta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money. For advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks. Also: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead To understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible. There are two main stages of awareness: Intent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you… you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward. Discovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery. Discovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly. Stay with me; you need to understand this to see the void… ⏳ TikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there. Also: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today Since TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers. What's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers. Without TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. 🥺 The obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. 🏆 Google is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine. Yeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine. Amazon also stands to benefit. TikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful. Also: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead Overall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people. I know what you are thinking: "You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more." And I feel strongly about that. However, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. 🔒 Looking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day. ByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. 📉 But guess who's probably low-key pissed about this? Shopify! Also: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting Shopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. 🤝 TikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales. TikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions. All I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. 🤔 If you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you. The obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem. The real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it. Here's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience. I've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs. The pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. 📢 What does that mean? Think about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform. If you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn. As someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. 🥴 As a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry. As a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out. As a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price. As a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld. As an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it. That said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote… "It's not happening to you. It's happening for you." 🤗 As cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times. 😇 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you. P.S. 📩 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

Title: Big Tech’s H1B Arguments Aren’t Just FALSE… They’re Also Immoral.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/27/2024 10:11:47 PM PST by SoConPubbie A fierce debate has broken out between President-elect Donald J. Trump’s very recent tech industry supporters and his long-standing America First base. At the core of the disagreement is the subject of legal immigration—specifically, how Trump should handle so-called “high-skilled” foreign worker programs like the H1B visa.One of the staunchest proponents of expanding the labor pool in this way is billionaire Elon Musk. In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

And the the same Globalist mentality pervades the corporate class especially of the Anglo-Sphere. The backlash in Canada has been such that Liberal Justin Trudeau has announced big changes to the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, with tighter qualifications, higher mandatory wage premiums. Canada is now positioned to the Right of the USA on foreign workers, and Trump needs to get on this. 11 posted on 12/28/2024 12:39:44 AM PST by Reverend Wright ( Everything touched by progressives, dies !)

That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

In a Christmas Day post on X, Musk exclaimed America needs more than double the 160,000 semiconductor industry engineers said to be required by 2032.“No, we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote, adding: “Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.”No, we need more like double that number yesterday!The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 25, 2024Additionally, Musk-allies and newly-named artificial intelligence (AI) advisors to President-elect Trump, David Sacks, and Sriram Krishnan, have both emerged as loud advocates for more legal immigration, expanding the high-skilled labor supply through changes to the H1B visa lottery.A FLAWED MORALITY.While bringing allegedly top talent from around the world to the United States sounds good on its face, this isn’t actually what H1B visas do.The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

Until this is fixed, we will continue to send our jobs to workers off-shore, and off-shore workers on-shore.I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The O-1 visa is actually the program used to grant legal work status to a foreign nation in the United States that is considered a ‘once-in-a-generation’ intellectual talent in a critical industrial sector.H1B visas apply more to workers with skills that native-born Americans can easily learn through technical training programs or even collegiate classes. Think more programmer or mid-level software engineer than someone trained in semiconductor fabrication.Even more concerning is that the big tech companies routinely abuse H1B visas as part of a scheme to suppress the wages of both American and foreign workers while maximizing shareholder profits.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice ramped up enforcement of visa rules after a pattern emerged in which tech companies artificially create the appearance of a domestic work shortage to increase their H1B allotments. This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie I keep saying it. The solution to this is simple. Allow companies as many H1bs and other work visas for foreigners as they want. Simply charge them an amount of money per visa per year that guarantees it will be.....key words here......MORE EXPENSIVE to hire those foreigners than it would be to hire Americans for those jobs.Viola! That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas. Frankly....good.

It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

This ultimately resulted in native-born workers being laid off and replaced two or threefold by cheaper foreign H1B workers.H1Bs benefit tech companies on two key fronts:First, on average, H1B workers are paid significantly less than their American-born counterparts. This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well.

This effectively puts downward pressure on wages across the industry, meaning American workers also get paid less;Secondly, because the visa is attached to the sponsor company, the foreign worker lacks the leverage afforded to American-born workers who can demand higher salaries by simply looking to take a job with a different firm.…AND A COMPLETE SCAM.Little data actually supports the tech industry’s claims of a worker shortage and a need to end H1B country caps. The data does suggest, however, that big tech is replacing qualified and capable American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon laid off nearly 30,000 high-skilled workers. In the same period—though in compliance with federal law regarding when companies can request H1B visa workers—the online retail giant expanded its workforce by nearly 100,000 foreign workers.Despite the layoffs, Amazon asked the federal government for a total allotment of 125,000 new H1B visa workers between 2022 and 2024, while they requested to retain around 90,000.Similar trends are true for Google and Microsoft. Between 2022 and 2024, nearly 60,000 American workers were laid off among the three companies, while the companies increased their H1B employees by over 340 percent.IS THERE A LABOR SHORTAGE?Ultimately, the entire need for H1B workers is predicated on a supposed domestic worker shortage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA. Not only are the arguments for it untrue, but creating more competition for American workers is not even close to the ‘America First’ philosophy.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

That's it. Problem solved.You wanna know why? IF there is truly a labor shortage, companies will pay it. They will need the workers and it will be economically productive to get those workers even if it means paying more money for them. It also will not undercut Americans' wages. It will have the side benefit of raising a lot of money for the treasury. I suspect it will also have the side benefit of getting companies to restart their job training programs so that they can get more Americans to have the skill levels in various areas to do the jobs they want done since employing Americans will be cheaper than employing foreigners. It will also mean Americans get their foot on the employment ladder at these companies and therefore will be the ones who get promoted down the road - instead of foreigners. Win, Win, Win, Win.The only people who would lose under my scheme would be companies which undercut American's wages via bringing in hordes of cheap foreign labor......companies which are lying and cheating to do so.....companies which are not participating in the free market in which supply and demand determine wages but which are instead rigging the game by bringing in a whole bunch of cheap supply from overseas.

It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." 18 posted on 12/28/2024 1:47:42 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: ETCM Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market. 20 posted on 12/28/2024 1:57:53 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current native-born American labor force participation is around 63 percent. Meanwhile the foreign-born labor force participation is a stunning 68 percent.Importantly, per the Wall Street Journal: “…census data show[s] immigrants who arrived since the start of 2020 are more than twice as likely to lack a high-school diploma as U.S.-born workers.”In January 2007, the overall American labor force participation rate was around 66 percent, but has declined to 62.5 percent. When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all.

This is true, but that's just the beginning. These "indentured servants" take the jobs of American graduates, blocking their entry into their chosen field. While the H1-b program is technically not an immigration program, they never leave. Having blocked Americans from the entry level jobs, they go on to fill the mid and upper level jobs as well. We have to break this cycle. The price of an H1-B (to an employer) should be to pay for the education of an AMERICAN, and to hire that graduate, as the H1-B is returned to their home country. 8 posted on 12/27/2024 11:37:33 PM PST by ETCM (“There is no security, no safety, in the appeasement of evil.” — Ronald Reagan) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 3 | View Replies] To: SoConPubbie Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world. 9 posted on 12/28/2024 12:17:49 AM PST by Jonty30 (Genghis Khan did not have the most descendants.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market.

When you examine the data overall, there is a strong suggestion that the high labor force participation among foreign-born workers is actually the cause of the lower rate of participation among native-born workers, pricing them out of the job market through downward pressure on wages.Additionally, even the big tech companies’ own annual reports suggest they’re not suffering from any significant shortage in skilled labor. Elon Musk’s own Tesla slashed 14 percent of its workforce in 2024. Generally, a company struggling with fulfilling its labor needs might see a small need to cut workers if it cannot hire to keep up with demand, but far more common is the company hiring instead of laying off workers at all. You certainly wouldn’t see around a fifth of a corporation’s labor force being laid off amid a worker shortage.In November of 2023, tech-giant Apple was sanctioned $25 million in fines and back pay due to American workers who were discriminated against in hiring—with the company essentially rigging its recruitment process in favor of foreign workers.Conclusively, there are excellent arguments for a more fierce O1B recruiting policy, but the idea of expanding H1B visas for foreign workers should be a total non-starter for MAGA.

Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. 19 posted on 12/28/2024 1:54:19 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: Jonty30 Big Tech are anarcho-communists. “You like the free market?” “Fine, we will use free market principles in order to show you why the free market does not benefit you, so you will choose socialism in order to survive.” Then they proceed to lock American workers out in favour of the third world.I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor.

That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market.

Frankly....good. I won't mind seeing them take it in the shorts - and finally have to start participating in a truly free market - one bit. Interesting points. It’s kind of like putting a tariff on H1B workers so other countries don’t dump them here. Off-Topic: Is your tagline a reference to the movie “Signs”? I'm a contractor. I do projects for large banks. It took me years and years to finally break in to this industry and I endured a Great Recession that was unbelievably awful first. What I saw when I finally started getting hired for these jobs was that those big bank buildings were absolutely stuffed full of H1b Indians....I'm talking about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the building was H1b Indians. The Banks were claiming there was a labor shortage even during the Great Recession when millions and millions of Americans - highly educated and highly qualified ones - were unemployed.Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH! What banks and others will do is try to make any job sound technical in any way they can...accounting jobs, audit jobs, etc etc. They'll highlight an information system they use or claim they need to work with databases, etc when they don't really and when someone with no background in tech at all could be taught to handle the tech portion of the job very quickly. But they claim that because of whatever technical description they've given in the job description, gosh darn....there just aren't hardly any Americans at all who are qualified. So they'll need to import more of that sweet sweet cheap foreign labor to do that job.It made me so incredibly pissed when I saw that. They want to participate in the American market with all of its money but they want to screw Americans out of the jobs in that market and give all those jobs to foreigners. They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Everybody talks about Tech. ITS NOT JUST TECH!

They need to be told "Hell no. We will NOT let you do that. You want to be in the American market, then you hire Americans and you pay American wages." Absolutely correct. Cheap foreign labor BOTH pushes down the wages of Americans employed in Tech and Banking (by an estimated 20-30%) but it also denies young Americans good entry level jobs. Then a few years later because there weren’t hardly any Americans in those entry level jobs, take a wild guess who gets promoted to middle management? That’s what I see happening more and more now at the big banks. They’re not yet at the Senior level but the H1b Indians are definitely filling more and more middle manager level roles. Meanwhile the young Americans who should have gotten those entry level jobs in their 20s are pushed down a rung on the ladder and go to the next most desirable jobs instead of these and the ripple effect is felt throughout the economy as Americans get pushed down one rung of the ladder all the way throughout the economy. I wouldn't call them that so much as saying they are cheating. They are not participating in a free market in the US where supply and demand would set wage levels. They are instead rigging the game by bringing in huge amounts of cheap foreign labor. Imagine if we passed laws that required them to only employ Americans AND to do so at vastly inflated wage levels. That would be rigging the game in favor of workers to an equal degree to what they're doing. That's not a truly free market. I happen to believe in the free market - which means it applies to both companies and workers and we don't allow any cheating to distort the free market.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Encode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California’s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk’s injunction to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company. In a proposed brief submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Friday afternoon, counsel for Encode said that OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit would “undermine” the firm’s mission to “develop and deploy … transformative technology in a way that is safe and beneficial to the public.” “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. “If the world truly is at the cusp of a new age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the public has a profound interest in having that technology controlled by a public charity legally bound to prioritize safety and the public benefit rather than an organization focused on generating financial returns for a few privileged investors.” In a statement, Sneha Revanur, Encode’s founder and president, accused OpenAI of “internalizing the profits [of AI] but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,” and said that “[t]he courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.” Encode’s brief has garnered the support of Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the AI field and 2024 Nobel Laureate, and Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor and director at the Center for Human-Compatible AI. “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,” Hinton said in a press release. “It received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.” OpenAI was launched in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft. Today, OpenAI has a hybrid structure: a for-profit side controlled by a nonprofit with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees. But in a blog post Friday morning, the company said it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest. OpenAI’s nonprofit will remain but will cede control in exchange for shares in the PBC. Musk, an early contributor to the original nonprofit entity, filed suit in November requesting an injunction to halt the proposed change, which has long been in the works. He accused OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission of making the fruits of its AI research available to all and of depriving rivals of capital — including his AI startup, xAI — through anticompetitive means. OpenAI has called Musk’s complaints “baseless” and simply a case of sour grapes. Facebook’s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI’s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have “seismic implications for Silicon Valley.” Lawyers for Encode said that OpenAI’s plans to transfer control of its operations to a PBC would “convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders.’” Encode’s counsel notes in the brief, for example, that OpenAI’s nonprofit has committed to stop competing with any “value-aligned, safety-conscious project” that comes close to building AGI before it does, but that OpenAI as a for-profit would have less (if any) incentive to do so. The brief also points out that the board for the nonprofit OpenAI will no longer be able to cancel investors’ equity if needed for safety once the company’s restructuring is completed. OpenAI continues to experience an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said in a series of posts on X that he worries about OpenAI’s nonprofit becoming a “side thing” that gives license to the PBC to operate as a “normal company” without addressing potentially problematic areas. “OpenAI’s touted fiduciary duty to humanity would evaporate, as Delaware law is clear that the directors of a PBC owe no duty to the public at all,” Encode’s brief continued. “The public interest would be harmed by a safety-focused, mission-constrained nonprofit relinquishing control over something so transformative at any price to a for-profit enterprise with no enforceable commitment to safety.” Encode, founded in July 2020 by Revanur, describes itself as a network of volunteers focused on ensuring voices of younger generations are heard in conversations about AI’s impacts. Encode has contributed to various pieces of AI state and federal legislation in addition to SB 1047, including the White House’s AI Bill of Rights and President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI.

Title: Google CEO Pichai struggled to navigate a pressure-filled year

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Google’s blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google’s employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company’s workforce. “We’ve noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,” one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. “How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company’s success?” The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. “Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases” another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company’s vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday’s close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai’s vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai’s standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google’s grip on U.S. search. The company’s share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had “offended our users and shown bias,” according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. “We definitely messed up on the image generation,” Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. “It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.” The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google’s traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked “How many rocks should I eat each day,” the tool said, “According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.” AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren’t hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview’s launch shouldn’t discourage them from taking risks. “We should act with urgency,” Reid said. “When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won’t always find everything and that just means that we respond.” Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ’s request represents the agency’s most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won’t have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company’s AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube’s combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple’s AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company’s cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company’s Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. “Google does not have one single visionary leader,” a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. “Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.” In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan’s and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of “chief scientist,” but internally, he is now listed as an “IC,” or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai’s leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should’ve happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google’s scrappy roots. He’s flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google’s Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company’s hit AI products in 2024. After Brin’s hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google’s position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they’ve seen Brin walking around the company’s Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they’re pursuing. Despite Brin’s reemergence, several employees told CNBC they’re doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn’t strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it’s hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company’s AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco’s waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of “Wicked” actors, where one, labeled “execs” looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled “Gemini” while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as “users.” A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. “Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company’s future, and are proud to work here,” the spokesperson said. A few employees say they’re no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more “cost efficiencies” across the company in order to invest more in AI. “I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities,” Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a “Central Reorg Support Team Partner.” The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff’s “ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.” “Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,” one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. “Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,” another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai’s leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn’t violate any of the company’s “AI principles.” However, documents and reports show the company’s agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that “Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.” In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google’s security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. “This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company “carefully confirmed” that every person terminated was involved in the protests. “By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.” That round of job eliminations underscored Google’s clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company’s original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker’s age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for “Google,” spelled out in the font of IBM’s logo.

Title: Analyst on Alphabet (GOOG): ‘Take a Deep Breath and Look Through Antitrust Stuff’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Wall Street is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against other AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO Sylvia Jablonski said in a recent program on Bloomberg that there are trillions of dollars of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to be invested in AI amid demand that is at an all-time high. “There’s a biggest wealth transfer of our generation happening as we speak. And you know, Gen Z, you know, Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X kind of, you know, the younger traders are, this is where they’re allocating their funds to. And, you know, retail has definitely spoken, and institutions have definitely spoken, and they’re looking for that, that fourth industrial revolution allocation.” Sylvia also talked about the relationship between quantum computing and AI and explained how this technology would improve AI systems: “So chatbot AI is, you know, kind of version one. Quantum is taking everything to the next level. So you need quantum in order for it to be efficient. You need to process that data quickly. It will help, you know, essentially health care, cryptography, aerospace and defense, you know, blockchain technology. Anything you can think of will be better, too, with quantum supercomputing power.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks that are currently buzzing on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 160 Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management chief marketing strategist, made the case for Alphabet during a program on CNBC and said he believes the stock is undervalued. “I would urge investors to look through the antitrust stuff, which I would say will take at least half a decade to play out. Use this as an opportunity to crunch the numbers. It’s now selling at its lowest PE relative to the market of all time—about 80% of the market PE in an expensive market. This is the one MAG7 stock I really like. It can perform well if it hits its earnings numbers, it’s not overly expensive, and it offers a nice way to invest in that space even if you’re cautious about the other valuations.” Grisanti also reminded investors about Microsoft’s anti-trust issues back in the day and the stock performance: “I’d ask investors to take a deep breath. I am old enough to remember Microsoft in the late ’90s and their six-year battle with the antitrust authorities, where the government sought to break up the company. Microsoft lost the first round but eventually prevailed on appeal. During that time, the stock tripled.” The market has been ignoring Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s key secondary businesses and the stock remains undervalued despite concerns around AI search and regulatory onslaught. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s secondary ventures in AI, autonomous driving, and other areas are making solid progress, especially in the Waymo robotaxi segment. Currently, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock trades below 20 times forward earnings, offering potential upside as EPS and other financial metrics strengthen in coming years. For next year, the consensus EPS estimate sits around $9. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently beaten projections, delivering $7.54 in trailing twelve-month EPS compared to the expected $6.79—a roughly 11% outperformance. With the 2025 EPS forecast at around $9, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could realistically achieve earnings closer to $10 if it maintains its historical outperformance rate. At a projected $10 EPS, Google’s forward P/E multiple would be approximately 17, a relatively low valuation for a diversified market leader. What are the key drivers for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In its autonomous driving division, Waymo has shown notable progress, with paid autonomous rides growing 200% quarter-over-quarter to 150,000 weekly rides as of late October, thanks to a fleet of 700 vehicles in service since August. This growth is significant: Waymo vehicles now average about 30.6 autonomous rides per day—substantially higher than Uber’s average of 4.18 rides per driver daily, based on Uber’s 31 million daily trips and 7.4 million drivers last quarter. This performance underscores Waymo’s competitive edge in autonomous ride volume compared to traditional ride-hailing. In the third quarter, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Search & Other segment saw a 12.2% year-over-year revenue increase, rising from $44.03 billion to $49.39 billion. YouTube advertising also performed well, with revenue up 12.2% to $8.92 billion from $7.95 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue grew even more sharply, surging 27.8% from $8.34 billion to $10.66 billion. Google Cloud has been expanding steadily, with revenue climbing from $13.06 billion in 2020 to $33.09 billion in 2023. Notably, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in 2023, posting $1.72 billion in operating profit—a significant improvement from a $5.61 billion loss in 2020. This segment’s performance continues to strengthen, with the latest quarterly revenue reaching $11.35 billion, up 35% from $8.41 billion in the same period last year. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks Wall Street is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: FedEx Corporation To Spin-Off FedEx Freight Business In 1H26
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joecornell/2024/12/27/fedex-corporation-to-spin-off-fedex-freight-business-in-1h26/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T18:02:33Z
Full Content:
(Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images) Deal Overview On December 19, 2024, FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX, $278.66, Market Capitalization: $67.1 billion) announced that its Board of Directors had concluded a comprehensive assessment of the role of FedEx Freight as part of its portfolio and has decided to pursue a full separation of FedEx Freight through the capital markets, creating a new publicly traded company (for more information, visit spinoffresearch.com). Earlier, FedEx disclosed in June 2024 that it was weighing options for the LTL business, which involves carrying multiple shipments from different customers on a single truck. The Company intends to execute the planned separation through a capital markets transaction, creating two independent, publicly listed, industry-leading companies. The transaction is expected to qualify as a tax-free separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to commence the separation process immediately, with the intent to execute the transaction within 18 months, subject to regulatory and certain other conditions and final approval of the FedEx Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is serving as the financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel. FedEx Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders The Company also announced its 2Q25 results on 12/19. The Company revised its FY25 outlook, where the Company expects flat revenue year over year, compared to the prior forecast of a low single-digit percentage increase. The Company expects Diluted EPS of $16.45 to $17.45 before the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments compared to the prior forecast of $17.90 to $18.90 per share; and $19.00 to $20.00 per share after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $20.00 to $21.00 per share. Key Data Deal Rationale The spin-off of the Freight business was announced as FedEx trimmed its full year profit forecast, highlighting how FedEx’s main businesses continue to struggle with weak demand, especially in the U.S. at its Express unit. As per Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. President and Chief Executive Officer, it is the right time to pursue a separation while the company navigates through the unique dynamics of the LTL market. Analysts have long argued that Freight was undervalued within FedEx, which has been slashing expenses and consolidating its express and ground operations to compete with delivery rivals like Old Dominion (ODFL), United Parcel Service (UPS), XPO (XPO), and Saia (SAIA). Year to date, the Company’s stock gained 10.5%, underperforming the S&P 500 index by 16.8%. With the spin-off of Freight from the rest of the Company, the management believes it will be able to achieve a premium valuation for its Freight business similar to its LTL competitors, most notably Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL). FedEx Freight, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, is estimated to have an enterprise value of more than $30 billion within the next 18 months, while a leading brokerage firm estimates the value between $30 billion and $35 billion. FedEx has identified strategic opportunities in separating FedEx Freight into an independent company while maintaining collaborative ties. The separation will enhance operational focus, accountability, and agility, enabling both entities to capture profitable growth and unlock market value. FedEx will continue advancing initiatives like DRIVE, Network 2.0, and Tricolor. Distinct public stock listings will provide unique investment profiles, strengthening the value proposition for each Company. Both entities will have strong balance sheets, allowing flexibility for growth investments and shareholder returns. Operational, commercial, and technological synergies will be preserved through agreements to ensure continuity, enhance speed, and reduce costs. The FedEx brand will remain unified, extending its values of speed, reliability, and trust across both businesses, with the new Company operating as FedEx Freight. Post separation, FedEx expects to deliver significant value to its stockholders through its transformation and strategic initiatives, focused on reducing the Company’s cost to serve while helping customers compete and win with the world’s smartest and most efficient logistics ecosystem. The initiatives underway through DRIVE are expected to create $4 billion in cost savings by the end of FY25. In comparison, Network 2.0 is targeted to generate savings of $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2027, supporting enhanced profitability and driving greater flexibility and efficiency across the network. FedEx remains committed to a continued strong balance sheet at both entities while continuing to reduce capital intensity and increase capital returns. Post spin-off, FedEx Freight will be the largest LTL carrier with the broadest network and fastest transit times in its industry. The Company already has a market share of around 17% and has deep and long-standing relationships with customers who value choice, simplicity, and reliability. With a focus on safety, facility utilization, revenue quality, and operational efficiency, FedEx Freight has maintained its leading market share position while increasing operating profit by nearly 2% on average per year over the last five years. The business has delivered approximately 1,100 basis points of operating margin expansion over the same period. FedEx Freight is expected to benefit from a strong balance sheet that will allow it to maintain and extend its leadership position in the LTL market. FedEx Corporation (FDX) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997, to serve as the parent holding Company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. The Company operated under two business segments, the Federal Express segment and the FedEx Freight segment. FY24 Segment Revenue and FY24 Geographical Revenue Federal Express Segment Federal Express pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader today, providing a range of rapid, reliable, time- and day-definite delivery services to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated air-ground express network. In connection with its one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express. As of June 7, 2024, Federal Express employed approximately 430,000 employees and had approximately 64,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), nearly 700 aircraft, and over 175,000 motorized vehicles in its global network. Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. Federal Express also provides cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions. FedEx Freight Segment FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity, and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of big and bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight Mexico offers FedEx Freight Priority to deliver cross-border and intra-Mexico LTL shipments door-to-door. Customers receive support from the FedEx Freight International Services team to monitor LTL freight shipments, review customer paperwork, and follow up to avoid shipping delays when shipments are crossing borders. FedEx Freight provides additional services to Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight and Federal Express. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers with easy access to their account information. Customers can also process domestic and cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Web Services, FedEx API, and LTL Select. FedEx Freight uses radio frequency identification technology and customized software to improve shipment visibility on its docks and enhance custodial control at the handling unit level. FedEx Freight Direct addresses the growing e-commerce market for big and bulky products. It has four delivery service levels to meet customer needs, with basic and basic by appointment-to-the-door services and standard through-the-door service available to nearly 100% of the U.S. population. Premium through the- door service with packaging removal is available to 90% of the continental U.S. population. The services include flexible delivery windows, end-to-end visibility, proactive notifications, and returns services with flexible pickup windows and label-less options. As of June 7, 2024, the FedEx Freight segment was operating nearly 30,000 motorized vehicles from a network of approximately 360 service centers and had approximately 40,000 employees. Lance D. Moll is the President of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. Financial Overview 2Q25 For 2Q25, the Company recorded revenue of $21.97 billion, down by 0.9% YoY compared to $22.17 billion in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to decline in volume and fuel surcharges. Revenue decline was due to lower revenue growth in both FedEx Express and Freight segments. Operating income was $1.05 billion, down 17.6% YoY, compared to $1.3 billion in 2Q24. Operating income margin was 4.8%, down by 100 bps. The decline in operating income was due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services impacted by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. Net income for the period was $741 million, down by 17.7% YoY compared to $900 million in 2Q24, and diluted EPS was $3.03 per share, down by 14.6% YoY. 1H25 For 1H25, the Company recorded revenues of $43.5 billion, down by 0.7% YoY, due to lower volume and fuel surcharges, partially offset by base yield improvement at both transportation segments. Additionally, 1H25 revenue was negatively affected by one fewer operating day at both of transportation segments and reduced demand surcharges at Federal Express. Operating income for the period was $2.1 billion, down by 22.8% YoY, with an operating margin of 4.9%, down by 140 bps compared to the prior year period. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower demand for U.S. domestic package and freight LTL services driven by macroeconomic factors, increased purchased transportation and wage rates, and higher business optimization costs. The results were also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and lower demand surcharges. This was partially offset by increased demand for international export package services, base yield improvements at Federal Express and FedEx Freight, and continued cost savings related to DRIVE. Net income for the period was $1.5 billion, down by 22.4% YoY compared to $1.98 billion in 1H24, and diluted EPS was $6.24 per share, down by 19.9% YoY. Segmental Information 2Q25 For 2Q25, The FedEx Express segment recorded revenues of $18.84 billion, up slightly by 0.4% YoY. The lower growth in revenue was due to lower priority package volume, the expiration of the contract (Sep 29) with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to provide the USPS domestic transportation services, and reduced fuel surcharges, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved base yields. Operating income for the period was $1.05 billion, up by 1.6% YoY, with an operating margin of 5.6%, up by 10 bps. The increase in operating income was due to higher base yields, partially offset by increased operating expenses. 1H25 Federal Express segment revenue was $37.1 billion, down slightly by 0.1% YoY, due to lower priority package and U.S. freight volume, partially offset by increased deferred package volume and improved yields. 1H25 revenue was also negatively affected by one fewer operating day and reduced demand surcharges. Federal Express segment operating income was $2.0 billion, down by 14% YoY, with a margin of 5.4%, down by 90 bps. The decline in operating income was due to increased operating expenses and one fewer operating day, partially offset by higher base yields. The increase in operating expenses was due to increased wage and purchased transportation rates, business optimization costs, and increased employee benefits, partially offset by lower fuel prices and continued benefits from DRIVE initiatives that drove a reduction in permanent cost structure. These initiatives included the continued transformation of its structural network, improving the efficiency of information technology and back-office functions, optimizing operations in Europe, and increasing linehaul efficiencies. FedEx Freight Segment 2Q25 For 2Q25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $2.2 billion, down by 11.2% YoY, primarily due to lower shipment volumes and reduced yields. Operating income for the segment dropped significantly by 36.5% YoY to $312 million, impacted by the decline in revenue. Operating income margin dropped by 570 bps to 14.3%. The decrease in income was partly offset by reduced operating expenses, with a 22% YoY decline in combined fuel and purchased transportation costs due to lower fuel prices and shipment volumes. Salaries and employee benefits expenses fell by 4% YoY because of reduced staffing to align with lower volumes, though higher wage rates partially offset these savings. Depreciation expenses increased by 38% YoY, primarily due to the absence of a gain on facility sales recorded in 2Q24. 1H25 For 1H25, FedEx Freight segment revenue was $4.5 billion, down by 6.8% YoY, impacted by lower shipment volumes, reduced yields, and one fewer operating day compared to the prior year. Operating income was $751 million, down by 22.8% YoY, and with an operating margin of 16.7%, down by 340 bps. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the revenue shortfall, partially mitigated by lower operating expenses. Combined fuel and purchased transportation costs fell by 16% YoY, reflecting decreased shipment activity and lower fuel prices. Salaries and employee benefits expenses were down 2% YoY due to reduced staffing levels, although higher wage rates offset some of the reductions. Depreciation expenses rose by 17% YoY, attributed to the prior-year gain on the sale of facilities in 1H24. FY25 Outlook FedEx has revised its fiscal 2025 outlook, expecting approximately flat revenue YoY, a downgrade from its earlier forecast of low single-digit growth. Diluted EPS is now projected between $16.45 and $17.45, excluding mark-to-market (MTM) retirement plan accounting adjustments, down from the prior estimate of $17.90 to $18.90. Including adjustments for business optimization costs, EPS is forecasted at $19.00 to $20.00, also lower than the previous $20.00 to $21.00. The effective tax rate (ETR) is now expected to be around 24.0%, revised from 24.5%. While unable to forecast MTM adjustments due to potential material impacts on consolidated financial results, FedEx reaffirmed permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion from the DRIVE transformation program and capital spending of $5.2 billion focused on network optimization, fleet modernization, and automation. These projections assume stable economic conditions, fuel price expectations, planned stock repurchases, and no new adverse geopolitical or economic developments. Share Repurchase Program FedEx completed $1 billion in share repurchases via open market and accelerated share repurchase transactions during the quarter. Approximately 3.7 million shares were delivered from the transactions, with the decrease in outstanding shares benefiting 2Q results by $0.07 per diluted share. The Company expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during FY25 for a buyback total of $2.5 billion. As of November 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the Company’s 2024 stock repurchase authorization. Cash on hand as of November 30, 2024, was $5.0 billion.

The company that began 2024 in turmoil after Sam Altman's dramatic return has morphed from a cautious non-profit company to an AI powerhouse worth $157 billion. With a $13 billion investment from Microsoft and a deal to power Apple iPhones, the company is on track to generate $11.6 billion in revenue. Game over for all the other suckers trying to elbow their way into the AI market? Hardly. The money flooding into AI continued to reach tsunami proportions throughout 2024, with billions of dollars going into funding dozens of worthy competitors around the world, ranging from China’s Moonshot AI to Paris-based Mistral. During the last week of November alone, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI pocketed $4 and $5 billion respectively. Investors who once saw OpenAI as the new big thing in tech are spreading their bets across a field of nimble, hungry competitors and anything ending in AI could be the next frontrunner—especially after delays from OpenAI, including Sora, its ballyhooed audio cloning tool (and, supposedly, its next GPT model.) It seems like decades since ChatGPT burst onto the scene with its revolutionary chatbot, which users could communicate with as easily as talking to a friend. (The chatbot launched in November 2022 and added speech in September 2024.) Almost overnight it made Google search look antiquated, something that the olds use. These days, it’s probably the first thing a GenZ thinks about when someone says “AI.” The company that sparked the AI revolution with ChatGPT pushed the boundaries of AI capabilities in 2024 after the boom of GPT-3.5, releasing its multimodal GPT-4o in May with an unprecedented 88.7% score on the MMLU benchmark. By September, its new o1 model—which is supposed to handle complex reasoning—raised the bar again, achieving 83.3% accuracy on International Mathematics Olympiad questions—a massive leap from GPT-4o's 13.4%. With over 200 million weekly active users, OpenAI's influence ran so deep that Google, deep in the throes of the Innovator’s Dilemma, suddenly began to fear for its $160 billion search business. But money and fame don't guarantee a happy ending, especially in tech. Anyone remember the Blackberry? Google certainly isn’t going the way of the Blackberry any time soon. Besides, it’s not like it was caught with its pants down. OpenAI was launched in December, 2015 and two months later, the search giant unveiled its new Gemini Ultra foundational model, with the capacity to process 2 million tokens of context—making OpenAI’s GPT-4 look light weight. AI is so integral to Google that CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company is moving from mobile to an "AI-first" strategy. And not a second too soon: The switch to Gemini boosted the popularity of Google One—the tier that offers access to Gemini Ultra—to over 100 million subscriptions 24 hours after its release. We just crossed 100M Google One subscribers! Looking forward to building on that momentum with our new AI Premium Plan (launched yesterday) offering AI features like Gemini Advanced, plus Gemini in Gmail, Docs + more coming soon. https://t.co/m7zAVop7P6 pic.twitter.com/sMdwJeq0iU — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 9, 2024 Google is not just flexing technical muscle; ChatGPT is still widely used but Google may be onto something. Its foundational model also powers its RAG, short for "retrieval augmented generation," platform NotebookLM, which was first conceived to help people handle huge amounts of information and data on big amounts of files. The product didn’t move a needle until an update changed the way people used RAG models. Welcome, Google’s podcast generators. That feature alone was enough to boost the model’s popularity, and increase user engagement with a pretty active Reddit community, interesting social experiments and even some business applications to explore. “I think we’ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they’re using it every day,” Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs, told The Independent. Meanwhile, OpenAI has given us a voice mode to talk to, still keeps its 128k token context window, and under legal threat, removed its horny Scarlett Johanson voice. The Gemini lineup has been key for Google’s outstanding performance. Since January 2023, its stock price doubled, reaching an ATH on July 10, 2024. Smaller than Google, but probably as important in terms of its role in the boom of AI chatbots this year is San Francisco-based Anthropic. Founded by former OpenAI researchers, Anthropic emerged as OpenAI's most formidable challenger in 2024, turning heads with explosive growth and deep-pocketed backers. The rivalry between ChatGPT and Claude, Anthropic’s suite of large language models, is the equivalent of the Cold War in AI culture. When one company releases a feature, the other immediately strikes back. The two models are always competing for the top spot in the LLM Arena and the community is always trying to decide which one is the best. Anthropic’s revenue grew over 1,000% this year after the launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June, with a major part powered by third-party API users. Anthropic's rise mirrors the early days of OpenAI, but with an even steeper trajectory. And the investments keep flowing in. Amazon has poured $8 billion into the startup, while Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion. These cash infusions were also probably strategic bets from tech giants hedging against OpenAI's dominance, and a mirror of a proxy war between cloud computing providers, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI to benefit Azure versus Amazon supporting Claude to benefit AWS. Anthropic and OpenAI mine the gold, whereas Microsoft and Amazon basically sell the shovels. Anthropic's success is not just due to its models’ quality. Overall, the company pushes for a broader shift in the AI landscape. While OpenAI chased consumer popularity, Anthropic focused on specialized models that prioritized safety, betting that enterprise customers would pay premium prices for targeted solutions. In Europe, French startup Mistral AI raised eyebrows by securing $1 billion in funding and a $6 billion valuation in June. Its open-source models are matching GPT-4's capabilities at a fraction of the cost. To put this in perspective, this means, according to calculations by Trending Topics, that "Mistral AI is worth €105m per employee," making it the most valuable startup in European history. A recent upgrade called “Le Chat,” is being positioned as Mistral’s ChatGPT killer. It offers basically everything ChatGPT does—for free. It provides good outputs, handles code, generates images, supports agents and browses the web in real time. And Mistral is just getting started, with a planned expansion into the United States and a new office in the belly of the beast in Palo Alto, California. Chinese firms aren't just copying anymore—they're innovating. Even with a major embargo imposed by the United States in an attempt to stifle innovation, companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Baichuan AI, backed by massive government support, are developing models tailored for emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. They're building a parallel AI ecosystem that could rival anything coming out of San Francisco. Huawei, the massive telecom giant supported by the state, for example, released its own OS and is embedding it into its lineup of smartphones and home devices, creating a fully functional ecosystem. Another Chinese model, Yi Lightning beats GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the LLM Arena, the new Deepseek has come to compete against OpenAI’s reasoning model o1, and Baidu’s Ernie reached 100 million users in December 2023 and boosted its user base to over 200 million users in April 2024 According to the World Economic Forum, China’s AI market is estimated to top $61 billion next year with VCs pouring over $120 billion into AI ecosystems. Believe it or not, Meta plays the role of the good guy in this story. While competitors such as OpenAI and Anthropic fought over market share with expensive, locked-down models, Mark Zuckerberg's company took a different route: open sourcing its technology. Llama 3.2, released in September, showcases just how far Meta's open-source strategy has come. The model processes both text and images, powers everything from augmented reality apps to visual search engines, and with Meta looking to work with U.S. government agencies to use its model on national security applications. And beyond government and corporations, the Llama-powered Meta AI chatbot is a pretty promising ChatGPT competitor. Recently expanded into dozens of countries, the chatbot can generate images of similar or arguably better quality than Dall-e 3 and even animate them (which ChatGPT cannot), search the web, handle coding tasks, and imagine scenes on the spot. Beyond that, Meta has other generative AI models for audio generation, video editing, segmentation, drawing animation, and more With Llama 4 around the corner in 2025, promising even better handling of text, voice, and images, Meta's betting that open beats closed every time. The numbers back up Zuckerberg's gamble. Meta AI, the company's answer to ChatGPT, racked up 500 million monthly users, with India leading the charge. Over a million advertisers jumped on Meta's AI bandwagon in September alone, cranking out 15 million AI-generated ads. The company's revenue shot up 18.9% year-over-year to hit $40.6 billion in Q3, with ad impressions climbing 7% while prices rose 11%. All this AI goodwill doesn't come cheap. Meta's dumping $38 billion into capital expenditure this year, mostly on AI research and the hardware to run it. That includes cramming its data centers with 350,000 of Nvidia's prized H100 AI chips by year's end. But Zuckerberg's playing the long game. By partnering with cloud giants AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure to host Llama models, Meta's building an ecosystem that could reshape how AI technology spreads—and who profits from it. Not bad for a company that lost almost 75% of its value when it started to focus on the "metaverse" and grew 600% since its shift to artificial intelligence as its key business model. Is OpenAI still king of the hill? Technically, maybe. At least it is the most recognizable—and valuable—AI startup in the scene. But the hill itself has changed. The race isn't about raw power anymore—it's about trust, accessibility, and real-world impact, and a few of these areas, notably trust and safety, are a bit murky right now for Sam Altman’s unicorn OpenAI's early lead has evolved into a complex web of specialized players, each carving out their own niches. Some focus on consumer applications, others on enterprise solutions, and a few brave ones tackle the fundamental research that could unlock AGI. For the immediate future, Sam Altman seems very confident OpenAI can reach AGI next year, which would put OpenAI on top of the hill for probably a long, long time if—and this is as “if” as it can get—they succeed. However, other very respected and talented experts, like Meta’s chief of AI research Yan LeCun, believe such achievement is accomplishable in around 10 years or so. Whether you decide to be optimistic or pessimistic will depend on who’s your favorite rockstar. That said, the real winner of 2024's AI race is the users. Competition drives innovation, but it also forces companies to address concerns about safety, privacy, and accessibility. This is why the Amodei brothers left OpenAI to found Anthropic and why Ilya Sutskeyver left to found Safe Superintelligence. This is why Huawei developed its own mobile OS and used domestic technology to build one of the best phones of the year, why developers come up with customized, better versions of the most popular AI models, and why AI as a technology has become a social phenomenon in the last two years. As these AI titans battle for supremacy, they're building tools that transform everything from how we work to how we create and communicate. And that 'one AI to rule them all'? Maybe that was the wrong question all along. In 2025's AI landscape, diversity will likely play an important role. And that might be exactly what we need.

Title: HHW Gaming Presents The 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up, Plus Our Pick For Game of The Year

Source: Ubisoft Montpellier / Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown / 2024 Video Game Wrap-Up 2024 has come to a quick end. It has been a rollercoaster of year in video games; we break down the good, bad, and ugly in our wrap-up. 2023 was a year to remember, thanks to releases like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more, but don’t get it twisted. 2024 was no pushover due to so many solid releases. There was also some shaky news in the gaming industry, and we will discuss all that and hand out our award for Game of the Year. So let’s wrap up 2024. Source: PlayStation / PS5 Pro Sony’s worst-kept secret, the PS5 Pro, finally arrived after a year and some change of speculation and information leaks. The reveal of Sony’s powerful console refresh landed with a thud with news of the console’s $700 price tag, and that’s without a stand and disc drive because both accessories are optional, leaving many asking, did play have limits? Many then asked if this console was even necessary, despite the company knowingly marketing it to a more niche gamer who prioritizes graphics and frame rates. The consensus on the console at the end of the day was that it provides players with a significant boost in performance and fidelity, but it’s not something you need to rush out and buy. We shall see how the PS5 Pro fares in 2025 and if it was genuinely worth Sony even making it. Our prediction: we expect it to fare well in the new year as developers focus more on the PS5 and Pro models and no longer have to wor optimizing games for the PS4. Source: Bernard Smalls / iOne Digital / HHW Gaming / PS Portal / PlayStation The PS Portal was a big surprise win for Sony. When it was first revealed, the immediate question was, why? It didn’t run natively, had no Bluetooth capability, and was essentially just a companion accessory for the PS5 console, only working off the console’s Remote Play feature. When news of the device started circulating back in 2023, and photos began hitting the web, we immediately felt that Project Q, as it was called at the time, was Sony’s way of testing if they should get back in the still hot handheld market, Nintendo very much dominates that. That turned out to be the case, with PlayStation boss Hideaki Nishino saying that the PS Portal sales were a “huge success” story for the company and adding that the device would continue to “evolve.” With the addition of Cloud Streaming (Beta), we have seen signs of Sony actively developing a native handheld device that will not require you to be tethered to your PS5 console. Sony isn’t alone; Xbox is also working on a handheld device but has yet to pull the lid off what has come up with. Keeping it a buck, if you have been on the fence about the PS Portal, now is a better time than any to consider getting yourself one; this gamer truly appreciates how clutch it is when being in front of the television and console is not an option. Just make sure that the internet and Wi-Fi are up to snuff. Source: Xbox / Xbox Gaming x Amazon Fire TV As we approached the end of the year, Microsoft made its plans for the future abundantly clear: almost all of your devices, not just the black box, are Xboxes. Since Xbox’s mission was clear after its shaky start following the Activision /Blizzard/King acquisition, it was able to regroup after its epic failures. Desperate for wins, Xbox finally got some, but not the conventional way. Instead, they released console exclusives like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment, followed by Sea of Thieves and Grounded on the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. These titles became best sellers in the PlayStation Store despite lackluster console sales. The highly anticipated Senua’s Sacrifice: Hellblade II, another technical masterpiece from Xbox studio Ninja Theory, was also released in 2024. However, it was also a polarizing game, with critics divided on whether it was worth the wait and whether it should have been considered a big exclusive for the Xbox Series X. Two massive wins for Team Green had to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to Xbox Game Pass to high praise. 2025 can be an interesting year for Xbox. Yes, many people are still skeptical about the company’s plans moving forward, mainly because they feel their loyalty has been taken for granted. Still, Xbox was losing, and they realized they needed to pivot. They still have their mid-level refresh console, codenamed Brooklin, the aforementioned native handheld in the works, and plenty of games in the pipeline, so we are still very intrigued. Source: Microsoft / Xbox Yes, it was cool to discuss all of the good things that happened in 2024, but we would not be honest if we didn’t mention the layoffs and the shuttering of numerous video game studios. At the beginning of the year, Microsoft announced it was laying off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees. This was not a good look for a company that had just spent $69 billion to acquire the Call of Duty developer. It continued the trend from 2023 when an estimated 10,500 game industry workers lost their jobs. Xbox also shuttered four of its studios: Tango Gameworks, which delivered the surprise hit Hi-Fi Rush; Redfall developer Arkane Austin; Alpha Dog; and Roundhouse. PlayStation also got in on the act as well, laying off 900 employees in February 2024 and suffering what the biggest miss of the year with its hero shooter, Concord, which never really got to see the light of day following a very poor reception and eventually shuttering the studio behind it, Firewalk was was. Gaming journalism also suffered after Gamestop shut down Game Informer magazine after 33 glorious years and many fire cover stories and exclusives. Gamestop didn’t even give the magazine the proper sendoff it deserved, opting for a lame landing page when you visit the now-defunct publications landing page. What a sad way for the iconic magazine to end. Former Game Informer employees discuss the unceremonious end on the FPS Podcast below. Source: Ubisoft / The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown In a year that saw plenty of bangers like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Astro Bot, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Helldivers II, Tekken 8, and more, there can only be one HHW Gaming Game of The Year. But determining which game would win our prestigious Game of the Year award wasn’t hard. The winner is Ubisoft Montpellier’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. There was no doubt that The Lost Crown was a special title from the first time we booted it up in January. In our review of the game, our resident gamer, Beanz, wrote: The Last Crown is a masterpiece; I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with this game. The combat is snappy and fun to use thanks to the combo system and Sargon’s acquired abilities, allowing for stylish, fast gameplay. While Ubisoft Montreal is hard at work on the Sands of Time remake, Montpellier’s The Lost Crown is not just a placeholder; it’s the perfect pivot for the franchise, putting it on a refreshing path to newfound greatness. Sadly, Sargon’s journey will likely not continue because Ubisoft disbanded the Montpellier team, leaving the game in limbo. This development is disheartening because Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was a unique game with the potential to become a new hit chapter in the iconic video game franchise. We will keep our fingers crossed that Ubisoft will recognize the error of its ways with The Lost Crown, but we’re not holding our breath. Well, that’s it for 2024, onward to 2025. Keep it locked on HHW Gaming for the games we are looking forward to in 2025, and hit the gallery below for other games we thought were bangers in 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. Investors are looking for new growth horizons in the AI industry to gauge whether the current market rally can continue for the years to come. Chetan Puttagunta, Benchmark general partner, said he’s noticed a lot of innovation in the past few weeks focused on improving the efficiency of algorithms. “In the last six to eight weeks, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of innovation, especially at the model layer, and then for the last two years at the application layer, taking advantage of all the advances in the AI models. Specifically, what’s happening at the model layer is, as we move into an inference-time or test-time compute paradigm, you’re seeing a lot more advantage to entrepreneurs and technical founders that are able to push to the frontier with algorithmic innovation.” To explain how AI is now actually improving workflows, Puttagunta gave the example of Sierra, a conversational AI startup making customer service solutions. “So think of this Sierra AI agent, if you will, delivering the best customer service agent experience every time, replicated an infinite number of times. And that’s an experience that was previously not possible without AI.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that are making moves amid the latest news. With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Jessica Lessin, The Information founder, editor-in-chief and CEO, recently discussed the state of AI space and her outlook on 2025. She mentioned the rising competition in the industry. “I think 2025 is going to be the year where all bets are off—or rather, all gloves are off—in AI competition. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dominate GPUs, but you’re also seeing Broadcom and others partnering with tech companies to diversify. Last week, at The Information, we reported that Broadcom is now working with Apple on an AI chip for inference. While it doesn’t directly compete with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), there is significant competition in the space. I believe investors should stay very vigilant and try to understand the dynamics within each tech company. The key question inside these firms is: how can we build, build, build to create more optionality in AI technology?” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Reportedly, technology giant Apple (AAPL) will be a consumer of Amazon’s new silicon. Manole Capital Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “As of this publication, Nvidia is up roughly 150% year-to-date. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the largest gainer in the S&P 500 last year and has more than tripled in value over the last year. It hit an eye-opening market capitalization of $3 trillion in June, less than four months after it eclipsed the $2 trillion mark. Enthusiasm for everything AI-related, especially for the primary chip maker whose products are essential to powering AI technology, continues to fuel the market. Last quarter, and for the fifth consecutive quarter, Nvidia reported sales and profits that blew past Wall Street expectations. The stock rose +37% in the second quarter alone.” Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of top AI stocks that should be On your watchlist for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on ARM Holdings plc (ARM): ‘I Prefer ARM Holdings Over Intel In The Current Tech Landscape’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bearish Calls: 10 Tech Stocks Heading for a Crash. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other tech stocks. For Jim Cramer, tech stocks and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts are a major talking point. Investors continued to deal with an uncertain macroeconomic picture that was complicated by a 'bullish dove' of a Fed that cut interest rates by 25 basis points but also hinted that 2025 would see fewer rate cuts than expected. The day the Fed announced the interest rate cut, the benchmark flagship S&P index sank by 2.95%, with more speculative investments such as Bitcoin dropping by a sharper 8.6%. Yet, as has been the case with the macroeconomic picture, the sell-off appeared to be a bit too much. Two days later, on Friday, the Commerce Department released the ever-important Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) dataset. The PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation reading, and it revealed that the annualized inflation in November was 2.4%. This reading was shy of 0.1 percentage point of economist expectations. As a result, it signaled to investors that perhaps the Fed might take it easy with the interest rates heading into 2025. The slightly improved expectations saw the S&P gain 1.86% on the day of the PCE data release. Cramer was optimistic as well, sharing that the data was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." However, he added that the bullish data release didn't mean that markets would reverse all their losses since Wednesday. Despite the fact that inflation ticked lower, the S&P index is still down 1.83% since the data release. Cramer shared some insight into the reasons behind the weakness. According to him, the market has been speculating a lot on areas such as quantum computing and Bitcoin. The CNBC host outlined that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" had driven the market performance ahead of the rate announcement. Consequently, since these areas lack fundamentals, investors might not have immediately returned to them. His Squawk on the Street appearance the day after the rate cut was also full of pessimism for quantum computing stocks. These stocks have gained as much as 162% over the past month - a development that would, on the surface, indicate a groundbreaking shift in their prospects. However, these movements have been driven primarily by Google's Willow quantum computing chip. The hype surrounding quantum computing is understandable as Willow claims to solve a problem that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve in less than five minutes. However, Cramer remains unconvinced about this technology niche. Commenting on the stock that ranked 16th on this list of stocks that he talked about, the host wondered what had driven its 162% in returns. Likening quantum computing stocks to non-fungible tokens, Cramer commented: "How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” As for the Fed, he believes that the central bank's data-dependent strategies backfired with the bullish rate outlook as "they chose not to be data-dependent." On the episode of Mad Money aired the day of the rate cut, he speculated that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to have been "caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn’t back it up." Cramer added that he believed "It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” On the next day, Cramer added the Fed might have been better off ahead of the call not having signaled that it was going to cut rates. However, as it did the opposite, it was locked into cutting rates while the data pointed towards a robust economy that might not have needed lower interest rates. "I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates," shared Cramer and added that the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped.” For 2025, Cramer wants investors to focus on stocks that might change the world. In a recent Mad Money episode, he outlined that some stocks tend to stand against the tide due to fiercely loyal followers. Sharing some advice, Cramer stated: “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” Our Methodology To make our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech stock calls, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks he was bearish on, analyzed their performance, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). High angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-22-24 Performance Since Then: -2.20% ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a British chip design house whose IP is present in the majority of smartphone processors and other chips. This enables the firm to enjoy a wide moat, which has strengthened in today's era of data centers and cloud computing. Big tech firms have used ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s designs to make in-house chips. The firm has also sought to further solidify its market presence by providing an off-the-shelf solution to firms looking to design chips. However, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)'s shares are down by 16% over the past six months as they have been driven by the firm's inability to significantly benefit from the ongoing AI boom despite its near-ubiquity in the smartphone industry. In August, Cramer shared that he preferred ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) over Intel, and the latter's stock has lost 5.6% since his comments: "Intel is struggling with competition from AMD and Nvidia, and I prefer ARM Holdings over Intel in the current tech landscape. Intel has challenges but may benefit if it can leverage AI advances effectively." Overall ARM ranks 6th among the tech stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Escalating US-China Trade War to Hurt These Tech Stocks in 2025
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-us-china-trade-war-153500064.html
Time Published: 2024-12-27T15:35:00Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The ongoing US-China trade war has intensified, with technology being a primary battleground. What began as a tussle over trade imbalances has evolved into a strategic clash over technological supremacy. Over the past few years, the United States has tightened its export restrictions, limiting China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies critical for Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G and supercomputing. Key players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Intel Corporation INTC and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM have been caught in the crossfire, facing regulatory and market challenges that jeopardize their growth prospects. Recent measures, including the U.S. Commerce Department's export controls on advanced AI chips and chipmaking tools, aim to curb China’s technological advancements. While these restrictions align with the U.S. national security objectives, they have disrupted the semiconductor supply chain and stoked economic tensions. In retaliation, China has imposed restrictions on rare earth metals critical for semiconductor production. The escalating trade war has created a challenging environment for U.S. tech companies reliant on the Chinese market. As we step into 2025, uncertainties surrounding the conflict are poised to affect revenue streams, supply chains and investor sentiment. Here's a closer look at how leading semiconductor players like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and QUALCOMM could bear the brunt of these challenges. NVIDIA has been a proponent of the U.S. government’s restrictions throughout the past three years. In 2022, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. In 2023, the United States imposed new restrictions on selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market. This year, the U.S. government restricted the export of NVIDIA's advanced A100 and H100 GPUs to China, a key market for AI development. The U.S. government is continuing its efforts toward restricting China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. These kinds of restrictions are going to hurt NVIDIA’s business in China with a negative impact on its top line, margin and cash slows further jeopardizing its ability to support existing customers and complete the development of certain products timely. NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Micron Technology had found itself in the middle of this tug-of-war long ago. For the company, chip sales in China make up more than 10% of its total revenues. In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for AI, data analytics and computing applications with the intention of stopping these chips from getting into Chinese hands. Later in 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China imposed a restriction on Micron on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. Tit-for-tat actions like these have the potential to jeopardize the company’s prospects, which are already afflicted by the weak demand for its memory chips. Moreover, the memory chip market’s cyclical nature, combined with these geopolitical tensions, could exacerbate its financial volatility in 2025. Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Intel’s total revenues experienced a whopping 27% contribution from its Chinese customers in 2023. The company faces unique challenges due to its reliance on both China for manufacturing and the United States for research & development. China’s latest stance of replacing U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives has become a concern for Intel. The country’s latest decision to phase out foreign chips from its major telecom networks by 2027, coupled with the U.S. government’s directive to revoke Intel’s chip export licenses to the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, has a big potential to affect the company’s top line. Although Intel has been heavily investing in its foundry business to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing, these efforts may take years to bear fruit. The company’s struggles to regain market leadership in the face of geopolitical headwinds could further pressure its bottom line and stock performance in 2025. Intel Corporation price-consensus-chart | Intel Corporation Quote QUALCOMM has a lot to lose from the US-China trade war as a major part of its business comes from China. The company has also set up multiple manufacturing facilities in China. In early 2024, Qualcomm faced the same restrictions as Intel where the U.S. government revoked its chip export license for certain technologies to Huawei. Retaliation from the Chinese trade associations and government can worsen QCOM’s situation. The Chinese government has already put policies, such as the Made in China 2025 initiative aiming for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025. These policies can enable QUALCOMM’s existing customers to develop their own chipsets . QUALCOMM Incorporated price-consensus-chart | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote The escalating US-China tech war presents a formidable challenge for U.S. semiconductor companies like NVIDIA, Micron, Intel and Qualcomm. These companies are not only grappling with the immediate effects of export restrictions and retaliatory measures but also facing long-term structural shifts in global supply chains and competitive dynamics. Investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments in the trade conflict as these could significantly impact the semiconductor industry’s growth trajectory in 2025. While U.S. tech stocks have historically been robust performers, the geopolitical landscape could bring volatility that warrants careful portfolio positioning. At present, NVIDIA and QUALCOMM each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Micron and Intel each have a Zaks Rank #3 (Hold).

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. CJ Muse, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, explained in a latest program on CNBC that the AI investment cycle is different from the ones we have seen in the past. Muse believes major technology companies investing billions in AI are generating “meaningful” free cash flows. “This cycle is unlike any other. I think most investors look back to the advent of the internet and how long the internet infrastructure investment cycle played out. But this one’s very different. The companies making the investments, predominantly the hyperscalers, are generating meaningful free cash flow despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars building out AI. Let’s be clear: this is existential for these companies as they all try to get to AGI. I think this is a multi-year investment cycle.” The analyst talked about the latest AI model released by OpenAI and said the race is now to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) and companies would require more and more computing power to improve the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

With each stock, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 Vijay Rakesh, Mizuho senior semiconductor analyst, said in a latest program on CNBC that Broadcom shares have more room to run: “Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), on the other hand, is just starting to put up massive numbers now. I think we like the name; they have a huge ramp coming up over the next two years. It’s very under-owned. People were cautious heading into earnings, and so we think there is probably some more legs left to the run.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 4th on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: OpenAI Lays Out For-Profit Business Strategy Amid Microsoft Talks, Musk Feud

Title: OpenAI may become a for-profit because it needs 'more capital than imagined'
URL: https://qz.com/openai-for-profit-sam-altman-investors-capital-musk-xai-1851729227

OpenAI has revealed a plan to restructure its operations and more cleanly separate the for-profit and non-profit arms of its business as it seeks to raise more cash. The artificial intelligence startup has been discussing plans to restructure for several months now, according to various reports, as it tries to attract new investors. OpenAI raised $6.6 billion at a $157 billion evaluation in its latest round of funding, which was reportedly led by Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital and backed by Microsoft (MSFT-0.56%) and Nvidia (NVDA-1.81%). But that’s not enough. “The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,” OpenAI’s board wrote in a new blog post. “We once again need to raise more capital than we’d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.” Under OpenAI’s current structure, the company’s investors are issued equity by its for-profit arm, which is overseen by its non-profit board, whose “principal beneficiary is humanity, not OpenAI investors.” The company announced its “capped profit” structure in 2019, after founding the company in 2015 as a non-profit. “As we enter 2025, we will have to become more than a lab and a startup — we have to become an enduring company,” OpenAI wrote, adding that its plans “enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space.” The ChatGPT maker’s new plan includes establishing the for-profit arm of OpenAI as a public benefit company (PBC), mirroring a step taken by xAI — helmed by OpenAI founder Elon Musk — as well as Anthropic. Although such companies have a stated goal of positively impacting society, the pivot to establish AI firms as PBCs has led to accusations of “ethicswashing.” By setting up the for-profit arm as a PBC, OpenAI’s current board will be able to consider the interests of investors more easily, which could help it win over potential shareholders. xAI, despite being less than two years old, raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation earlier this month, while Anthropic has raised almost $14 billion in venture capital since it was founded in 2021 by ex-OpenAI employees. Although details were not revealed by OpenAI on Friday, previous discussions had explored giving CEO Sam Altman about $150 billion of equity, according to Reuters. The non-profit side of the business will hire its own leadership team and staff to engage in charity involving the healthcare, education, and science sectors, according to OpenAI. It will also own “significant interest” in the for-profit side through stock determined at a “fair evaluation” determined by third-party advisors. OpenAI’s plans face a few hurdles, including a slew of recent executive departures and a revived lawsuit from Musk, who wants to stop the company from becoming a for-profit. In November, Musk expanded his lawsuit against the AI startup and several of its co-founders, accusing it of anticompetitive behavior and calling it a “market-paralyzing gorgon.” Later in the month, Musk’s attorneys filed a preliminary injunction against the AI startup, several of its co-founders, and Microsoft to stop its transition to a for-profit company. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The AI stock trade is starting to shift beyond the 'Magnificent 7'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence has once again driven the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks to another banner year, with Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) stocks all recently hitting record highs while Nvidia (NVDA) shares boast a more than 175% gain this year. Next year, investors expect the hype to spread even further into areas like utilities and software stocks, which will continue to benefit from Big Tech's large AI bet. Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin projects the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025 and that the rest of the market's gains will come closer to those of large-cap tech stocks. "It's less about valuation but more about earnings growth that will dictate those returns," Kostin said during a Goldman Sachs 2025 media roundtable with reporters. "The narrowing of the differential between the growth rates is likely to lead to a narrowing of [difference in] the performance." The rapid earnings growth seen in large caps over the past 18 months is expected to slow, while earnings are expected to pick up for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500. BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, issued a 6,666 year-end target for the S&P 500 in 2025 that includes a call for a broadening of earnings driven in part by AI. "AI is definitely playing a role in 2025 earnings," Subramanian told Yahoo Finance. "And in fact, one of the reasons that we're bullish on the broadening out of earnings is the idea that instead of everybody spending on tech capex, tech capex is actually picking up, and tech companies are sort of spending on a broader array of industries." To Subramanian's point, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta alone are expected to have increased capital expenditures by 42% in 2024 and another 17% in 2025, pushing their total spend next year to $244 billion. Not all of this spending is on AI chips. Tech companies are also ramping up spending to pay for the power required to run AI data centers. During a 2025 outlook roundtable with reporters, BlackRock's Investment Institute pointed out that the power required to operate one data center is about equal to the average amount of power used in a day by all of New York City. This has strategists, including BofA's Subramanian, bullish on the companies exposed to that part of the technology buildout, including the Utilities sector (XLU), which is already up more than 20% in 2024, partially driven by AI optimism. This part of the AI trade has already begun to shift. In his 2025 equity outlook, Kostin highlighted a basket of three potential AI trades, noting that the transition from "phase 1" stocks like Nvidia to "phase 2" stocks in Goldman's AI "infrastructure" bucket is already well underway. As seen in the dark blue line in the chart below, AI infrastructure stocks, which include other semiconductor companies like Arm Holdings (ARM) and utility power plays like Vistra Corp (VST), have already seen large rallies. In the year ahead, Goldman thinks the changing of the AI guard will further take hold as the trade moves to "phase 3" under a basket of stocks Goldman has dubbed "enabled revenues." These are a group of companies that will benefit from the rollout and monetization of AI solutions. In other words, those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. A large portion of this basket of stocks that Goldman is tracking are software and services stocks, including names like Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and Adobe (ADBE). And as seen in the sharp move higher in the lighter blue line in the graph below, "phase 3" AI stocks are already catching a bid. For example, Salesforce shares recently added more than 10% after reporting earnings and citing the success of its new AI tool, Agentforce. Goldman added that this isn't necessarily a call for AI infrastructure stocks to underperform the market in 2025 but rather to point out which portions of the AI trade could have more upside. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon agreed. As the AI trade enters its next phase, "there should be more focus, or an increasing amount of focus, on the adopters versus the creators," Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

US stocks opened on a downbeat note as Wall Street slogged to the finish of a largely triumphant year. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 2.2% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gave up 1%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. After stacking impressive gains this year, some of the biggest names in tech are losing ground as investors take profits, rebalance their portfolios, or reassess their lofty valuations. Tesla (TSLA) on Friday lost more than 4%. Nvidia (NVDA) gave up 3%, while Amazon (AMZN) decreased by 2.5%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains, but markets have been unable to mount a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. Markets have largely digested the year's remaining key economic data points, and investors are now turning their attention to two big themes for the coming year: the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates and the implications of Donald Trump's ascent back to the White House. On the former, stocks have largely taken in stride the Fed's plans to scale back rate cuts next year after an initial plunge last week. Bets have now shifted squarely to May as the next meeting at which the Fed will slash interest rates, as it continues to grapple with stubborn inflation while keeping a close eye on a cooling labor market. And on the latter, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul writes that while Trump talked up his big plans during the campaign, especially on the economy, those plans could soon face a reality check from other key power players. The US government long had the nation’s biggest tech giants in its sights, and in 2024, it hit bull's-eye. The big victory came in August when the Justice Department convinced a federal district court judge that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) had abused its search engine dominance and violated antitrust law. What transpired in 2024 could have future implications for some of the other big names in the tech world, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims. For now, Wall Street doesn't appear rattled. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks of the world's largest technology companies helped push the market higher in 2024, thanks partly to advancements around artificial intelligence. But the incoming Trump administration adds another layer of uncertainty to the next chapter of Big Tech antitrust enforcement.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost about 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.3% Friday morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hovered near seven-month highs around 4.6%. Wall Street has just three trading days remaining in a 2024 full of big gains and is hoping to resume a "Santa Claus" rally into the end of the year. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up more than 26% on the year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is up over 30%. The blue-chip Dow (^DJI) has risen a more modest 14%. Airline stocks soared in 2024. The S&P Supercomposite Airlines Index has climbed 60% for the year — its biggest yearly gain in a decade, Bloomberg reports. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has risen roughly 27% over that time frame. While major airlines Delta (DAL), United (UAL), Alaska (ALK), and JetBlue (JBLU) were all down slightly Thursday, they are set to post yearly gains far ahead of their S&P 500 peers. United Airlines is the best performer of the group — its stock soared 144% in 2024. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group shares are up nearly 72% for the year. Delta Air Lines rose 55% in that timeframe, and JetBlue climbed 41%. American Airlines' (AAL) performance was in line with its peers, while Southwest Airlines' (LUV) 18% gain for the year fell behind.

While insider buying often signals confidence in the company's future, insider selling may occur for various reasons and doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of faith in the company. However, large or unusual transactions can be worth noting as part of a comprehensive investment analysis. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024. After Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of "Wicked" actors, where one, labeled "execs" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled "Gemini" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as "users." A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. "Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here," the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more "cost efficiencies" across the company in order to invest more in AI. "I think any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities," Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a "Central Reorg Support Team Partner." The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff's "ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations." "Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do," one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. "Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people," another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai's leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn't violate any of the company's "AI principles." However, documents and reports show the company's agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that "Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations." In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google's security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. "This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe," a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company "carefully confirmed" that every person terminated was involved in the protests. "By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable." That round of job eliminations underscored Google's clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars' Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company's original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker's age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for "Google," spelled out in the font of IBM's logo. WATCH: Google's fate hinges on this man: Demis Hassabis Got a confidential news tip?

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence.

Title: Turning Chaos Into Opportunity: Navigating The QA Industry's New Reality

Ruslan Desyatnikov is Founder and CEO of QA Mentor, Inc., an independent software-testing company headquartered in New York. As the tech sector faces unprecedented upheaval and widespread layoffs, the QA industry is feeling the impact, grappling with new uncertainties. This shifting landscape presents significant challenges that demand our attention. It’s time to confront how these changes are reshaping the world of quality assurance and what it means for professionals in the field. From 2022 to 2023, major tech firms carried out significant job layoffs. Amazon let go of 27,000 workers, Meta dismissed 21,000 and Microsoft laid off 10,000. These figures have only grown as we moved into 2024, as over 500 tech companies have made job cuts, resulting in over 100,000 employees losing their jobs since the start of this year. This is a world away from 2020-2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation that led to heightened demand for tech products and services, such as remote work tools, e-commerce platforms and digital entertainment. During this period, tech companies saw stock prices soar on investor optimism in a pandemic-changed world. Global central banks kept interest rates low to aid economic recovery, allowing tech firms affordable borrowing for growth. Government stimulus and aid bolstered businesses, including tech, amid pandemic uncertainties. As the global economy faced renewed challenges around 2022, including rising inflation and interest rates, tech giants shifted gears from their aggressive hiring stance of 2020-2021. Now, they're cutting back on hiring and implementing layoffs to ensure financial stability post-pandemic. This abrupt change is reshaping employees' career trajectories from optimism to uncertainty almost overnight. In this industry upheaval, the QA sector must seize the opportunity to leverage automation and AI to stay competitive. As AI testing solutions advance, QA professionals need AI tools to remain marketable. By integrating AI, companies can: • Optimize efficiency with AI. AI-driven tools quickly spot patterns and anomalies often missed by traditional methods, streamlining testing, cutting manual work and boosting productivity. AI also prioritizes test cases based on data, ensuring focus on critical areas. • Control costs through predictive AI.

Title: Drill, Baby, Drill 2.0: Why Trump’s Return Will Bring Blockbuster Years For Natural Gas
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/12/27/drill-baby-drill-20-why-trumps-return-will-bring-blockbuster-years-for-natural-gas/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
In October 2008, with the economy reeling from the onset of the Great Recession and oil prices having spiked to $147 per barrel ($211 in today’s money), Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden was asked during a debate to contrast his party’s energy policy with that of the Republicans. Biden said that their “only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.” His vice presidential opponent Sarah Palin pounced; “The chant is ‘drill, baby, drill.’ And that’s what we hear all across this country… because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.” Biden and Obama won that election, though Biden woefully underestimated American ingenuity. During the Obama years drillers boosted natural gas production by 45% to 92 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), while oil output more than doubled to 9 million barrels per day (bpd). But the frackers were too successful, causing a global oil glut that drove prices down to $28/bbl in 2016 and bankrupted dozens of companies. The industry recovered during the first Trump term; with executives refocused on growing profits. Despite the industry’s antipathy for Joe Biden, U.S. oil output has climbed steadily during his presidency to a record 13 million bpd of oil and 125 bcfd of natural gas today. And again the world is in an oil glut. Prices are currently hovering around $70/bbl and OPEC is holding back nearly 5 million barrels per day of untapped production capacity against the world’s daily 103 million barrels of consumption. Meanwhile Chinese oil companies are predicting peak oil demand as widespread electric vehicle usage in the nation is replacing gasoline guzzlers. “The fundamental outlook is bearish,” writes oil analyst Michael Hsueh at Deutsche Bank. This is why the resurgence of Drill, Baby, Drill under the second Trump term will focus not on oil, but rather natural gas. Biden has been a decidedly anti-gas president. The biggest affront: in 2022 he instituted a moratorium on new approvals of liquefied natural gas export projects. In recent years LNG exports from the U.S. have grown from nothing to 12 billion cubic feet per day, about 8% of total domestic supply. Despite the permit ban, projects already approved and under construction have continued apace, and are set to more than double U.S. exports. According to Neil Beveridge, analyst with Bernstein Research, “The expected glut of LNG is still coming, but it has been delayed, with maximum supply now expected in 2026 or 2027” – just in time for Trump (who is widely expected to reverse Biden’s ban) to take credit. A large portion of U.S. LNG heads to Europe to replace sales of Russian pipeline gas halted by the war on Ukraine, and to Asia, where it lessens reliance on the burning of far dirtier and carbon-intensive coal for electricity. Supplying LNG to the world is only half of the Drill, Baby, Drill equation. New demand for electricity in the United States is set to surge during the Trump years, particularly because of the rise in artificial intelligence. McKinsey, the consultancy, figures that the electricity needed to power A.I. data centers will grow from 25,000 megawatts today to 83,000 mw by 2030. This could cost upwards of $300 billion of capital investment in power plants, buildings, transmission lines and server farms. Data centers power demand would grow to some 12% of all U.S. electricity, up from 5% now. Drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania. Observing this coming need for power, Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI and others have invested billions into everything from solar and wind to advanced nuclear and geothermal. Investors in new publicly traded nuclear startup Oklo include Chris Wright, Trump’s incoming Secretary of Energy and Sam Altman of OpenAI. Oklo says it will work with developer Switch to roll out 12,000 megawatts of new nuclear by 2044. That’s a lot, but won’t come soon enough. Until advanced nuclear is a real thing, gas has proven it is the only scalable bridge fuel capable of displacing coal. Over the past 20 years U.S. has reduced coal consumption 63% from peak down to 400 million tons per year, while natural gas use is up by more than half to 33 trillion cubic feet per year. As a direct result, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are down 15% over this period, the most of any developed nation. (China, by the way, continues to use record amounts of coal, 5 billion tons last year.) So the tech giants are turning to gas. One example: Meta recently announced plans to build a datacenter and 2,200 megawatt gas-fired plant in West Richland Parish, Louisiana, at a cost of $10 billion. Meta’s gas supplier is likely to be Occidental Petroleum, whose shares are down 20% this year to $48. Oxy is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top holdings. Over the the summer it added several million more shares in the petroleum company at a price of nearly $60 per share. Investment analyst Chris Dowd at Third Avenue Management sees good times ahead for a cadre of other gas-focused exploration and production companies. These days he says his team is “licking its chops” on a micro-cap called SandRidge Energy. The Oklahoma City-based SandRidge (market cap: $406 million) emerged from bankruptcy a couple years ago and carries virtually no debt against a portfolio of some 450,000 acres of gas fields in the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and environs. Dowd loves that SandRidge has been keeping some of its wells “shut in” – holding on to gas in the ground rather than sell it at what has been historically low prices over the past year. Dowd says SandRidge has the potential to boost output 20% in short order to respond to LNG and A.I. demand. The company also has $1.6 billion of past operating losses to shield future earnings from federal income taxes. Biden’s permitorium “gummed up the inventory” of new wells needing to be drilled and fracked, says Dowd. “Once we get that flowing and don’t have the start-stop, we will have the machine really humming.” Coterra Energy is “another one that is a coiled spring,” says Dowd. “If we have ‘drill, baby, drill’ they can really lean in to adding production.” Coterra ($18 billion market cap) has been aggressive in buying back stock, but has a richer P/E of 15. Dowd prefers SandRidge. Trump is likely to allow the leasing of more federal lands for gas drilling. Biden’s Dept of Interior in 2023 leased only 161,000 acres of federal land, versus an average of 1.2 million acres a year during the Obama and Trump years. The reason is the Bureau of Land Management’s new “conservation and landscape health rule,” which places ecosystem health concerns (i.e. the threatened greater sage grouse and dunes sage lizard) on equal footing with the economic benefits of resource extraction. Of somewhat greater concern to the oil lobby is the Biden EPA’s newly finalized rules governing “fugitive emissions” of natural gas from fields and pipelines. Operators will have to pay $900 per ton of emissions, rising to $1,500 per ton in a few years. And they have to pay to install equipment to monitor those emissions and verify them using third parties. Many gas producers would welcome Trump efforts to soften or scrap the methane rules, which could cost billions of dollars a year in fines for the nation’s biggest emitters. One of those, Houston-based Hilcorp Energy, owned by billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, recently agreed to a consent decree and $9 million civil penalty with the EPA over natural gas emissions from its San Juan Basin fields in the Four Corners region. Hilcorp teamed with Carlyle Group in 2017 to buy the decades-old San Juan assets for $3 billion. The field emits a lot because it consists of 12,000 gas wells across 2 million acres and hundreds of miles of gas collecting pipelines. Hilcorp promised to cut 113,000 tons of emissions there over 3 years – like taking 24,000 cars off the road. Some gas producers aren’t too concerned by such restrictions, because they have already been working not just to limit leaks, but to capture and permanently sequester carbon emissions. Chris Kalnin, CEO of BKV Energy, which raised $200 million in a 2024 IPO explains that his company has been injecting carbon dioxide underground at its shale fracking operations in north Texas. The work is monitored by gas detectors and third-party certified by American Carbon Registry, which mints non-fungible tokens representing the amounts of carbon sequestered by BKV and published them to the blockchain. This way BKV can sell its customers “decarbonized” gas, at a roughly $5 per thousand cubic feet premium. Alternatively, BKV can turn that gas into lower-carbon electricity at the 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant that BKV acquired in Temple, Texas. “We see multiple ways to win, aligned with megatrends,” says Kalnin. “The greens are on one side and drill, baby, drill is on the other side, and the silent majority is stuck in between,” says Kalnin. BKV (market cap $1.9 billion, $250 million ebitda) initially built up a gas position in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania, then in recent years Kalnin took the unusual tack of buying up assets in the birthplace of shale gas fracking – the Barnett shale field outside Fort Worth, Texas, where wildcatting legend George Mitchell proved out the combo of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In 2020 BKV bought Devon Energy’s fields there for $500 million. And in 2022 it acquired ExxonMobil’s Barnett for $750 million. Kalnin says Exxon hadn’t made any meaningful investments there for years. “The Barnett is alive and well,” he says. And there’s plenty of shale gas left to frack all across the country. “They left huge meat on the bone.”

Title: What Drove The 70% Surge In Barclays Stock This Year?

BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM - OCTOBER 18: The sun shines on the Barclay's logo outside a branch of the ... [+] bank Barclay's on October 18, 2023 in Bristol, England. Barclay's has confirmed that it will close a number of branches due to changing customer habits with virtually all banking transactions now taking place online. The number of people visiting physical branches has fallen dramatically in the last five years, according to the company, with the Covid 19 coronavirus pandemic also contributing to changes to banking habits. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) Barclays stock (NYSE: BCS) has gained about 70% year-to-date, as compared to the 25% rise in the S&P500 over the same period. In contrast, Barclays’ peer Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is up 35% year-to-date. Also see, What’s Happening With HSBC Stock? So what are some of the factors that have driven Barclays’ stock higher of late? Earlier this year, Barclays announced a strategic overhaul aimed at stabilizing its operations and improving profitability. The bank has shifted its focus toward expanding its domestic lending business in the U.K, including mortgage lending and personal loans, which offer greater stability. At the same time, it has been reducing costs in its more volatile investment banking segment. The company also bought Tesco Bank in a deal that was closed in early November in a move that bolsters Barclays’ retail banking presence in the UK. Barclays is also targeting over £2 billion ($2.5 billion) in gross cost savings and aims to improve its Return on Tangible Equity to over 12% by 2026, up from about 9% in 2023. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Barclays posted better-than-expected Q3 results. Net profits attributable to shareholders stood at £1.6 billion (about $2 billion), while Barclays’ revenues for the period rose 5% year-over-year to £6.5 billion. Growth was driven by the company’s investment banking business - which has considerable exposure to the U.S. market - fared well, led by renewed deal making activity as well as higher volatility in the stock markets, which boosted fee revenues. The bank is also seeing higher-than-expected net interest income - essentially the difference between the interest earned on loans and what they pay on deposits. Barclays raised its NII guidance for 2024 to £6.5 billion ($8.16 billion), up from £6.3 billion previously. This improvement is driven by slower-than-expected rate cuts in the UK and structural hedges that the company previously took on to mitigate the impact of falling interest rates. The increase in BCS stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 32% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 6% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We value Barclay’s stock at about $12 per share which is slightly below the current market price. See our analysis of Barclays’ valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate.

Title: From Apple’s record valuation to Zara’s share surge: An A-Z of financial markets in 2024

It was the year that the drawn-out Apple tax case finally came to a conclusion as the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) confirmed that the European Commission had been correct in deciding back in 2016 that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid from Ireland and must pay the State €13 billion in back taxes, plus interest. Outgoing EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who persisted with the case, would tell reporters hours after the final ruling that she had broken down in tears when she learned the outcome. The €14 billion pot, including interest, held in escrow since 2018, took centre stage in the recent general election, featuring in all party manifestos as they pledged to spend the windfall on everything from housing to the green transition. The case had no bearing on Apple’s own share price, however, as it spiralled to new heights, making it the first business to beach the $3.5 trillion (€3.3 trillion) level. Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C was rattled in June when the drinks group restated three years of its earnings due to accounting errors, resulting in the company taking an underlying charge of €5 million and parting way with its chief executive of just over a year. C&C subsequently said that it will pay a €1.3 million settlement to the former CEO, Patrick McMahon. He had succeeded David Forde, who quit in May 2023 after the group incurred a one-off charge of €25 million related to the delayed implementation of a new business management system at one of its UK units. Corre Energy, the second-last company to float on the Irish stock market, in 2021, plunged 95 per cent this year as the storage developer for renewable energy required two emergency cash injections from large shareholders as it searched for a long-term investor and saw members of its original board, including its founders, depart. The Irish-run but Dutch-based company said in October that it was now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany, with the first of these on track for a final investment decision in 2026, after its previously most advanced project in the Netherlands encountered permit challenges. DCC, the Dublin-based but London-listed distribution and services conglomerate founded in 1976 by businessman Jim Flavin, moved to abandon its conglomerate roots in November as it set out on a path to sell its healthcare and technology units to focus on its fast-growing energy division. It follows the disposals over the past decade of DCC’s food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brand, the frozen and chilled foods logistics business, and recycling and waste management arm. Analysts estimate the healthcare and technology units could fetch a total of more than £3 billion (€3.63 billion), with the cash generated set to be returned to investors, most likely by way of share buy-backs. CEO Donal Murphy is hoping the narrowing of DCC’s focus will turn investors’ attention to how its energy division, which still earns most of its money selling fossil fuels to households, is increasingly targeting the green energy transition. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other big central banks remained centre stage during 2024 as they began to reduce interest rates following a series of hikes in recent years in a war against inflation. The ECB cut its key deposit rate a total of one percentage point spread across four quarter-point reductions since June. The rate-setting body for the euro zone expects inflation across the region to be back at its 2 per cent target next year, down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023. Wall Street in New York lured more Iseq heavyweights this year, with Flutter Entertainment, parent of Paddy Power and Betfair, delisting from Euronext Dublin, the Irish Stock Exchange operator, in January. It was followed in July by Smurfit Kappa, which moved its main quotation to the US on completion of its merger with cardboard box-making rival Westrock to form Smurfit Westrock. CRH had quit the Irish market in late 2023. Greencore more than doubled in value in 2024 following a tumultuous eight years, as its CEO of two years, Dalton Philips, steered a recovery for the maker of sandwiches to ready-made Italian meals for big supermarkets. In the process, Philips backed out of low-yielding contracts and leaned into trends such as the “joy of missing out” to push dine-in meal kits to those happy to forgo going out. Greencore’s earnings for the year to September topped the company’s own guidance, even after it had raised its forecasts three times during the period. Philips also signalled that the group is preparing to get back out on the acquisitions trail for the first time in years. Harland & Wolff, the Belfast-based shipbuilder that produced the Titanic, collapsed into administration in September, with insolvency practitioners at Teneo assigned to oversee the process, after it failed to find new funding to stay afloat. The company’s AIM-listed shares in London were suspended in August and ultimately delisted in October. The administrators entered exclusive talks the same month to sell the business to Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navartia. A deal was agreed before Christmas. Ires Reit, the Republic’s largest private residential landlord, reached a truce with activist investor Vision Capital in April by offering two board seats to nominees of the Canadian firm as the group continued a strategic review into its options as the share price remained under pressure. Ires hired property industry veteran Eddie Byrne as its CEO that same month, succeeding Margaret Sweeney. The board concluded in August that a substantive sale of the group or its assets – which Vision had been seeking – was not in Ires’s best interests, though it committed to a “capital recycling programme”, selling off noncore apartment assets to unlock some value for investors. The outcome has yet to excite stock market investors. Ires’s shares fell over 17 per cent this year. Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) shares were in the doldrums this year as the US pharma and medtech giant continued to add to a settlement offer aimed at ending thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits linked to its talcum powder. J&J moved in September to wrap the $9 billion (€8.54 billion) settlement in a pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy of a unit, called Red River Talc, in Texas. A federal judge will decide on the validity of this route – which would end almost all cases – early next year. Kingspan was in focus in September as a long-awaited final UK report on the Grenfell tower disaster in London. The company’s Kooltherm K15 insulation board had been used for 5 per cent of the insulation behind the building’s cladding. The Cavan-based group didn’t know that its product had been used in the development and the report found that insulation was not the main cause of the fire that claimed the lives of 72 people. However, the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was scathing of the group for falsely claiming that a form of K15 had successfully passed fire tests that allowed it to be used on the external walls of high-rise buildings in the first place. It “knowingly created a false market” for the insulation, he said. Luxury goods groups from LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Kehring, owner of brands including Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, to Swatch, whose watch brands span Omega to Longines, saw their shares slide this year amid uncertainty around demand out of the key Chinse and Japanese markets. Management consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will fall 2 per cent this year, with economic uncertainty shrinking the industry’s customer base. It reckons China, which had seen a sustained boom for years amid a growing middle class, is on track for a 22 per cent sales slump in 2024. CRH selected chief financial officer Jim Mintern to succeed Albert Manifold, who had pursued record levels of deal-making over the past 11 years to move the traditional seller of cement and other base materials into full-scale construction services, as of the end of 2024. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€12.5 million) last year and CRH said in its latest annual report that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align” with practices in the US, where it moved its main stock market listing last year. Nvidia, the undisputed darling of Wall Street as the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, saw its shares soar over 190 per cent over the course of 2024 – pushing its market value to $3.43 trillion (€3.3 trillion) – as it continued to deliver blowout earnings. Its stock rose at a multiple of the pace of the other members of the so-called magnificent seven, which also include Facebook’s parent, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon. Japanese camera giant Olympus was in focus for all the wrong reasons in October when its German CEO, Stefan Kaufmann, was booted out amid allegations of the purchase of illegal drugs. Kaufman, who had joined a European unit of Olympus 21 years ago, was subsequently indicted by prosecutors, suspected of having taken possession of cocaine and the synthetic drug MDMA multiple times in Tokyo in 2023. Irish financier Paul Coulson’s Ardagh saw its riskiest bonds trade at below 20 cent on the euro during 2024 as investors became increasingly concerned about the glass and metal containers group’s $12.4 billion (€11.7 billion) debt pile – especially as the outlook for its glass bottles unit continued to weaken. The multinational glass and metal containers manufacturer for the drinks industry, built up by Coulson over the past 25 years, continues to weigh how to reduce its borrowings. The price at which its most-junior – or subordinated – bonds have been trading indicates that holders of these notes expect they will have to write off much of what they are owed as part of restructuring. Coulson owns about 36 per cent of the business, which traces its roots back to the now long-defunct Irish Glass Bottle Company. CEO quitting and firings hit record levels globally in 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the international firm that assists “transitioning” executives find new roles. Big CEO exits include Laxman Narasimhan from Starbucks, who was ousted by his board in August after 17 months, Mark Schneider at Nestlé, Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing, Pat Gelsinger at Intel and Carlos Tavares at Stellantis, the car-making group whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep. Reddit, the Californian social media company, made its long-anticipated stock market flotation on the Nasdaq in March in a deal that valued the business at $8.87 billion (€8.4 billion). The 19-year old company, popular for its member-led communities known as subreddits that span interest areas from world news to brain-rot memes, has seen its share price soar about 250 per cent since, helped by the posting its first-ever profit in the third quarter of this year, as a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature that translates English posts into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German drove user numbers higher. Sterling became the surprise best-performing currency among those by G10 (group of 10 industrialised nations), following years of volatility that has seen it dubbed the British lira among other names, according to the Wall Street Journal. The pound rose as much as 5.2 per cent against the euro alone, as the Labour Party’s election victory in June lifted a lot of political uncertainty and the Bank of England trailed other big central banks in cutting interest rates. Still, that was nothing on the performance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which soared as much as 150 per cent – turbocharged in November by Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. The Republican has vowed to make the US the “crypto capital” of the world. Elon Musk’s Tesla soared 29 per cent in the week of the Trump victory, pushing it above the $1 trillion (€950 billion) valuation mark amid hopes the president-elect’s highest-profile promoter on the campaign trail (who contributed more than $130 million to the cause) will see his companies get favourable treatment from the incoming administration. Still, China’s BYD overtook Tesla late last year as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles with its more affordable range. It also sped past Tesla in terms of overall revenues in the third quarter for the first time, helped by hybrid sales as well as battery-powered vehicles. Italy’s second-largest bank, Unicredit, ruffled political and labour union feathers in Germany in September when it swooped in to snap up a 21 per cent stake in Frankfurt-based Commerzbank with a view to launching a takeover bid. While chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a big proponent of an EU banking union, he denounced the Italian manoeuvre as “an unfriendly attack”. Unicredit has since launched a €10 billion bid for domestic rival Banco BPM – and its CEO, Andrea Orcel, has indicated he is unlikely to make a move on Commerzbank at least until German elections are done and dusted in February following the unrelated collapse of Scholz’s government. Still, he has since upped the Commerzbank stake to 28 per cent. Irish banker David Duffy led Virgin Money to a £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) sale to fellow UK lender Nationwide Building Society at the end of September to create the second-largest mortgages and savings business in that market. The former AIB chief executive quit the Irish bank in 2015 for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), then a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. He led CYBG through an IPO in early 2016 and into a merger two years later with Virgin Money. Duffy stepped down as Virgin’s CEO as the Nationwide tie-up was completed and is estimated to have secured a pay-day worth as much as £15.3 million (€18.3 million) through the sale of shares and stock options he held in the bank. Walt Disney defeated a challenge to its board in April from activist investor and Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, handing a victory to CEO Bob Iger and ending one of the most expensive boardroom battles in history. The stock has rallied strongly in the past few months after the company reported better-than-expected results for its financial year to September, boosted by its streaming business and issued a rosier outlook than followers of the company had been used to in recent times. French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel set out on a path towards full ownership of Eir, as two US hedge funds began to exit their investment in the former Irish telecoms monopoly, in which debt market investors hold €1.35 billion of bonds. Firms belonging to Niel acquired 64.5 per cent of Eir in April 2018 in a deal that saw two of the company’s largest pre-existing investors, hedge funds run by New York firms Anchorage Capital and Davidson Kempner, roll most of their shares into a combined 35.5 per cent interest. It is understood that Davidson Kempner sold its 8.9 per cent holding in the business over the summer to Anchorage Capital. Anchorage began to gradually sell down the combined stake by participating in a share buyback by a holding company above Eir in October. Neil’s stake currently stands at about 69 per cent. The market interest rate – or yield – on French 10-year government debt rose above those of crisis-scarred Greece for the first time in late November as Michel Barnier’s government limped towards collapse after he controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right grouping and the left-wing New Popular Front united in early December to force through a no-confidence motion in the former Brexit negotiator’s government. Greece, which emerged from a third international bailout in 2018, saw its creditworthiness upgraded to investment grade in late 2023 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, following 13 years of junk status. Its economy has grown faster than the EU average over the past five years, its government is rapidly reprivatising banks that were rescued during the crisis and it is repaying chunks of its bailout loans ahead of schedule. Zara owner, Inditex’s shares soared as much as 45 per cent in 2024, twice the pace of the wider European retail sector as its popular fashion ranges and nimble operations helped it cope better than some of its rivals with changing consumer demands. The group, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear brands, has been quicker to adapt to fashion trends and potential headwinds than some of its rivals, thanks to its tightly managed supply chain, according to analysts. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Inditex’s ambitious expansion plans in the US, its second-largest market by sales, where it opened its first Zara store in 1989 and where its Massimo Dutti brand has made a tentative return recently after a previous foray into market failed. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: From Aer Lingus pilots to Alias Tom: Who were the winners and losers in Irish business this year?

Mopping up the messy entrails of 2024 isn’t a straightforward job. What kind of year was that anyway? For much of the business world, it felt like a wait-and-see period – a damp purgatory for some, a cushioned holding pattern of a year for others. Plenty enjoyed a 2024 that was somewhere between reasonable and decent, if not the definitive bounce-back they had hoped for in January. Some started the year in positions of strength and went on to manifest more success than ever. Some, channelling corporation tax receipts, were worryingly buoyant. But within industries wracked by inflation, cost-of-living pressures and/or retreating rates of investment, “survive ‘til 25″ became the quiet catchphrase. Some ran out of money, then ran out of time. Some just wilted. Others swam in a sea of setbacks, gasping through another quarter, another season. Dispiritingly, those for whom the year could have been better included much of the hospitality industry. More than 600 restaurants, cafes and food businesses closed, according to the Restaurants Association of Ireland industry lobby group, as swollen costs and the legacy of pandemic debt overwhelmed them. In August, there was shock among restaurateurs as celebrated chef Dylan McGrath shut down two restaurants, Brasserie Sixty6 and Rustic Stone, warning that hospitality in Dublin was “simply not sustainable”. Other big names joined in the retrenchment: October saw Shanahan’s on the Green close for the foreseeable, while Dillinger’s in Ranelagh said goodbye to customers after a 15-year “wild ride”. For Press Up, the fast scaled-up group founded by schoolfriends Paddy McKillen jnr (son of the property developer) and Matt Ryan, there was something even more unpalatable on the menu: a reckoning. In September, London-based lender Cheyne Capital took control of the group in a debt-for-equity swap that aims to solidify its financials. One Wowburger and three Wagamama restaurants in Dublin were shuttered and though it later opened Asian restaurant Kaldero in the former Wagamamas outlet on South King Street, it was still a glum autumn for a group that had previously seemed immune from the woes of the sector. Not far away, a retailer at the heart of Dublin since the 1970s was counting the cost of changed fashions: Alias Tom, which in its time had clothed U2, Westlife and the business and political elite, went into liquidation, citing “the move toward less formal workwear”. Founded in 1976 by Tom Kennedy, Alias Tom once had exclusivity on brands such as Prada, Hugo Boss and Gucci. But in 2024, the “only realistic option” left for the company – 10 per cent of which was still owned by Kennedy – was to wind up. Dublin stockbrokers were part of the Alias Tom clientele at one point, but Dublin stockbrokers are now themselves a lesser spotted breed. As for the Irish Stock Exchange, which has traded as Euronext Dublin since 2018, this wasn’t a vintage year. In July, packaging group Smurfit Kappa, as it was then known, completed a hat-trick of heavyweight exits that started in 2023 with CRH and continued in January with Flutter Entertainment. Mention of the 231-year-old exchange in the budget speech of the somewhat younger Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, reflected the extent to which a halving of companies on the Iseq All-Share index since 2018 was perceived to have become an Ireland Inc problem, not merely a Euronext one. It hasn’t helped that HealthBeacon and Corre Energy, two of the only three companies to take initial public offerings (IPOs) in Dublin over the past five years, have not had a tremendous time of it. By January, cash-burning medical technology company HealthBeacon had progressed from “embattled” status to officially in need of rescue. One arrived courtesy of US-based kitchen appliance maker Hamilton Beach Brands, but the company consequentially delisted. Corre Energy, for its part, spent most of 2024 watching its share price plunge. There was little else to do. The company develops underground storage facilities for renewable energy, but permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on its key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project in the Netherlands until after 2027. Back in February, co-founder Darren Patrick-Green exited his president and executive director roles after an unrelated business he owned was linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme. In November, with Corre still desperately seeking a strategic investor, chief executive Keith McGrane stepped down. A search for new executive energy began. The relief at the start of the year was that there appeared to be no sequel to “tech winter”, the job-shedding phenomenon of 2022-23 that had seen just about every technology company in town announce at least one round of redundancies. But 2024 ended on a bum note for the indigenous sector after the Government opted not to extend the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) accelerator programme – which trains, mentors and invests in start-ups – beyond its November 2025 end date. It was open-letter time. [ The Irish Times view on the National Digital Research Centre: ending State funding is short-sightedOpens in new window ] More than 200 tech founders warned that if the Government didn’t reverse the decision, which they blasted as “disconnected from reality”, it would stymie future innovation and economic resilience. Alas, a general election had already been called by this point and no one was paying much attention. Michael O’Leary, an early election headline-maker, more often than not appears in the winners’ section of this annual review. The longest-serving chief executive of any large airline doesn’t really have bad years, not relative to everyone else. The short-haul king doesn’t even have to crack a joke for a roomful of Fine Gael supporters to collapse with laughter because they think he has. Alas, one of the key tasks to befall him in 2024 was to wait for multi-troubled Boeing to pony up the planes it owes his airline, and for that reason alone it can’t have been a hilarious year. The new executives in charge of the US manufacturer “continue to disappoint”, O’Leary was heard lamenting in summer. By October, he seemed resigned to the likelihood of having to “walk back our traffic growth” as a result of delivery delays he summed up in characteristic style as a “pain in the backside”. To the election, then. Losing slowly in count centres is a common fate, but presumably no less deflating for that. Caught up in a comprehensive greenlash, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media Catherine Martin was second only to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the high-profile casualties list. Martin, who will be missed by an arts community she supported better than most, came under Oireachtas committee-grilling pressure in the spring after she appeared to stir up tensions from nowhere with then RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh over the precise nature of the information conveyed to her about the procedures followed when RTÉ reached an exit agreement with former RTÉ finance chief Richard Collins. RTÉ hadn’t done anything wrong this time, but the organisation-reforming Ní Raghallaigh, baffled by the Minister’s arcane complaint, felt forced to resign, and later echoed Martin’s critics in the Opposition by accusing her of “taking a hands-off approach” to its various crises. It seemed there was also nothing any Minister could do, meanwhile, about airport operator DAA’s strange obligation – thanks to a 32 million passenger cap mandated by planning laws – to actually suppress passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. In August, the airport had the busiest month in its history. A good return on investment for the public money that is annually poured into promoting Ireland to potential overseas visitors? DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs, frustrated by the uncertainty and branding the cap “not the best look for Ireland”, was not the only one wishing it was that simple. As the year neared its close, one Irish export was confirmed as a toxic brand. Conor McGregor’s earning power unravelled at pace after a High Court jury upheld Nikita Hand’s civil claim that she was raped by the mixed martial arts fighter in a Dublin hotel. IO Interactive, the Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, was the first to “cease its collaboration”. Then, one by one, every retailer that had previously been keen to sell McGregor’s Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey destocked them. Proximo Spirits – the company to which McGregor sold his whiskey in 2021 – valiantly announced it would stop using his name and likeness in its marketing in a bid to save its acquisition. But with even the paraffin wax version of McGregor at the National Wax Museum taken out of circulation, the taint by association was unmistakable. Let’s swiftly segue now to some bona fide winners via the spectre of Donald Trump, a man who showed us all in 2024 that being a judge-confirmed rapist is no barrier to becoming US president. Trump’s election victory threatens to make losers of vast tracts of the planet, if not the planet itself – a cheery thought to dwell on when Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra breaks into its traditional Hootenanny rendition of Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think). But if the world ends in 2025, at least some people can say they went out on a high. Those highs were literal for Aer Lingus pilots. By late July, they were back in the air after a two-week work-to-rule period plus an eight-hour strike. Holding firm in the face of “management intransigence” meant they pocketed a 17.75 per cent pay increase – following a Labour Court recommendation – rather than the 12.25 per cent originally offered. They also won a boost to their allowances and swerved the rostering concessions sought by the IAG-owned airline. Along the way, the travel plans of 90,000 passengers were disrupted while, as the dispute hit the headlines, social media users were quick to spy a certain resemblance between Capt Mark Tighe, president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association, and one Captain Birdseye. He won’t have cared. For the pilots, the outcome was, he said, “the greatest pay award seen in 30 years”. After seeing his stock plummet within international tech circles in 2023, Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave ascended once again this year to cruising altitude. He was back as chief executive of the events group, having served a six-month hiatus to placate the tech luminaries who found his stance on Israel – that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies” – controversial. Some of them, including Meta and IBM, returned to sponsor this year’s event in Lisbon at which a more muted Cosgrave avoided any further turbulence. A memorable main character of another kind was at the centre of the film Poor Things, in which Emma Stone played an adult woman implanted with a baby’s brain, bringing home four Oscars and a box office take of $117 million (€110 million). [ Poor Things review: Emma Stone is properly unsettling in this provocative feminist fable drenched in Victorian horrorOpens in new window ] This was heartening for fans of unsettling, offbeat fantasy cinema. But it was even more rewarding for Element Pictures, the prolific Dublin production company led by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, with the total of 11 Oscar nominations garnered by Poor Things setting a new record for the most ever secured by an Irish-produced film. Another home-grown company generating joy was Smyth’s Toys. Accounts filed later in 2024 showed the retailer’s combined pretax profits across the regions in which it operates hit €54.6 million in 2023. That’s a lot of Lego. Indeed, with its businesses in the Republic and Northern Ireland now representing just 14 per cent of its total revenues, the Mayo brothers behind Smyth’s Toys have made expansion across Europe look like child’s play. Also doing well overseas was Co Tyrone’s Sarah Friar, the former chief executive of neighbourhood social networking service Nextdoor, who in June joined artificial intelligence hype-lodestone OpenAI as its chief financial officer, working alongside Sam “superintelligence” Altman. Another appointment of note came in December when Trump nominated Dublin-born Gail Slater as assistant attorney general at the US department of justice’s antitrust division. “Together, we will Make America Competitive Again!” the president-elect posted on Truth Social. Making America Healthy Again, genuinely, were the EY Entrepreneur(s) of the Year: Sharon Cunningham and Orlaith Ryan, the chief executive and chief technology officer respectively of Clonmel-headquartered Shorla Oncology. Their company, which raised $45 million this year, counts four US Food and Drug Administration-approved products within a growing portfolio of accessible, life-saving treatments for patients with rare, orphan and paediatric cancers. At the ceremony, Ryan described the award as “validation” for the Shorla team’s years of hard work. But whatever happened to those erstwhile Iseq stalwarts after they upped sticks from the Dublin stock market? It was onwards and upwards for Tony Smurfit as he moved seamlessly from his role as boss of cardboard box-making giant Smurfit Kappa to the new position of group chief executive of packaging mega-giant Smurfit Westrock. This followed July’s formal seal on the Irish company’s deal to merge with US peer WestRock. Smurfit Westrock, which has its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported a net loss for its first quarter as a merged group, booking $500 million (€461 million) of expenses and accounting adjustments related to the transaction. But its earnings otherwise pointed to “a strong foundation to build upon”, said a confident Smurfit. True, not every athlete at Paris 2024 was a huge fan of the sustainable cardboard beds the company supplied to the Olympic Village. The good news, however, is that these have now been recycled into “the equivalent of 1.5 million wine boxes”. Cheers! Cement-maker CRH, for a long time the largest stock on the Iseq, found itself enjoying New York life. In the 12 months after it relocated its main listing to Wall Street, its share price swelled 60 per cent. By autumn, it seemed not even bad weather could leave much of an imprint on its performance. It will be all change for the company in 2025, with acquisition-loving chief executive Albert Manifold set to be succeeded in the top job by his finance chief, Jim Mintern. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€11.9 million) last year, hanging on to his title as the highest paid boss of an Irish plc, but Mintern could be in line for an even bigger bonanza, with the company indicating that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align with US practices”. Insert dollar signs here. Will gambling company Flutter Entertainment have a ka-ching of a 2025? You wouldn’t bet against it. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, led by chief executive Peter Jackson, recently snapped up Italy’s Snaitech and a 56 per cent stake in Brazil’s Betnacional operator NSX Group – deals that give Flutter top three positions in most of the world’s regulated gambling markets. National Football League (NFL) results didn’t quite go the way of its US brand FanDuel in October, but you can’t win them all – not in the short term. Over the medium term, as more US states legalise sports betting, FanDuel and Flutter remain poised to cash in. There were comebacks of sorts this year for two Irishmen who both resigned from their previous roles after different forms of misconduct. Declan Kelly – who quit his global public relations firm Teneo in 2021 after accusations of drunken misbehaviour at a charity concert – spent 2024 signing up sports stars and business names for his new-ish advisory vehicle Consello, which expanded its operations into Ireland. As for former BP chief executive Bernard Looney, he was “wishing BP well”, he said, as joined the board of US data centre company Prometheus Hyperscale a year after he was obliged to resign from the oil giant for failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Having spent 32 years at BP, Looney (54) told the Financial Times he was “thinking about the next 32 years” of his career. Same, Bernard, same. It may take almost that long to assess the full ramifications of the creeping change and dramatic power swings we witnessed and endured in 2024. But for now, with the tendrils of Christmas already starting to unwrap, the only thing left to do is to wish everyone who deserves them many sustainably profitable returns in 2025 – and everyone who doesn’t, none. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Valve makes more money per employee than Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix combined

The big picture: Valve is one of the most important and influential companies in the PC gaming market. It's also one of the most unique due to its private nature and unusually small workforce relative to its impact and competitors. A recent analysis of data uncovered through an ongoing lawsuit against the company highlights how Valve starkly contrasts with the world's biggest tech giants. A Valve employee recently provided PC Gamer with a rough calculation of the company's per-employee income, revealing that Valve generates more money per person than several of the world's largest companies. While the data is a few years old and doesn't account for some significant recent trends in the tech sector, Valve's ranking in this metric likely hasn't shifted much over that time. Exact figures for Valve's per-hour and per-employee net income remain redacted. However, a chart from 2018 confirms that Valve's per-employee income exceeded that of companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon. Click to enlarge Facebook's second-place ranking of $780,400 per employee – or $89 per hour – likely stands far ahead of competitors such as Apple and Microsoft because Facebook employs just under 70,000 employees compared to the two PC giants, which each have workforces over twice that number. By contrast, Amazon, with a headcount of over 1.5 million, earned only around $15,892 per employee, or $1.81 per hour. Filings from a 2021 antitrust lawsuit brought by Wolfire Games revealed that Valve employed just 336 people at the time – fewer than the development team for Baldur's Gate 3. Despite this relatively tiny workforce, Valve oversees Steam, which hosts nearly 40 million daily users and dominates the PC game sales market. Wolfire cited this discrepancy as evidence that Steam's 30 percent revenue commission for most titles is unjustified. Notably, the available data doesn't reflect the impact of the Steam Deck, Valve's handheld gaming PC, which launched in 2022. It's unclear to what extent Valve hired or outsourced additional staff for the device's development and production, but it's unlikely the company expanded its workforce anywhere near the scale of other tech giants. Valve would likely remain at the top of a per-employee income ranking based on current data. However, recent trends such as widespread layoffs and the ongoing AI boom could shift the standings for other companies. It would also be intriguing to see whether Nvidia has entered the ranking, as the AI explosion has propelled its profits to new heights, recently making it the newest member of the $3 trillion club.

Title: The era of big bets on EV plants in Canada is over - it’s time for consolidation, minister says

Industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector.Tara Walton/The Canadian Press The era of Canada putting down big bets on massive new electric-vehicle battery plants is coming to end. As Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne has led the strategy that’s seen Stellantis N.V., STLA-N Volkswagen Group and Honda Motor Co. HNDAF commit to new factories in Ontario that represent some of the biggest investments in the history of Canada’s auto sector. A few months ago, Mr. Champagne was still talking up the possibility of landing one or two more such commitments from global automakers. But in a year-end interview with The Globe and Mail, he acknowledged he’s no longer big-game hunting the same way. Instead, the focus has shifted to solidifying the existing commitments during a turbulent period for the nascent EV sector, and leveraging them to grow out the domestic supply chain that they are meant to anchor. “Now, it’s about consolidation,” Mr. Champagne said, referring in particular to landing and advancing investments in mining and refining battery materials such as lithium, graphite and nickel. Repeatedly invoking a new mantra about the need to achieve greater “speed and scale,” he was tacitly acknowledging that Canada needs to dramatically pick up the pace for the battery plants to be supplied primarily by the country’s ample reserves of critical minerals – access to which was one of the main reasons cited by the automakers for placing the investments here. Mr. Champagne also reflected on how Ottawa’s EV-battery strategy has played out to date, defending the government’s billions of dollars in subsidies, in the face of mounting skepticism resulting from setbacks in the auto sector’s transition to EVs, as it has struggled with slower demand growth than expected. While that bumpiness has not derailed the three landmark battery plants in Ontario, it has jeopardized a fourth planned by Sweden’s struggling Northvolt AB, and seen other retreats such as Ford Motor Co. F-N putting off plans to assemble EVs at its facilities in Oakville, Ont. Quebec says Northvolt battery project will go ahead as company cuts 20% of global staff How much longer Mr. Champagne will be the point-person for the strategy is an open question, given that a federal election early in 2025 appears increasingly likely, and the governing party that he serves faces a double-digit deficit in opinion polls. But his perspective may be useful context for whoever is in office by the end of 2025, and tasked with deciding whether and how to double down on trying to turn Canada into a force in EV-making. One of his arguments is that subsidies for the battery plants will not be nearly as high as most people perceive – particularly when it comes to Stellantis and Volkswagen, which most media reports have suggested will top $28-billion in combined support from the federal and Ontario governments. (The Honda deal has a lower ceiling and is structured differently.) That figure is essentially the maximum total possible, contingent on the plants operating at full capacity from the earliest possible date, because it’s mostly derived from production subsidies per battery made that expire in the early 2030s. An arguable upside of the EV demand-growth slowdown, to which Mr. Champagne implicitly pointed, is that the cost for taxpayers will be lower because the factories – expected to be operational for decades – won’t need to ramp up as quickly. “People have this impression that we have dispersed that money,” he said. “But today, I’ve landed tens of billions of investments, and I’ve only dispersed a few hundred million.” He was somewhat more philosophical on the more negative consequences of the industry’s recent struggles, including for Canada’s large industry of parts-makers and other suppliers at the mercy of automakers’ rapidly shifting timelines for EV roll-outs – framing it as inevitable during a revolutionary industrial change. “If you look at the history of the world, when you have a shift in technology for the next century, the first few years are always bumpy,” he said. “My role, and the role of the industry, is not only to look at next week or next month or next year, but to position Canada for long-term success.” He also suggested that in the near-term, Canada is well-positioned to weather uncertainty around the pace of the shift away from internal combustion engines, because Ontario still has several assembly plants making vehicles with those gas-fuelled motors for the foreseeable future, as well as some (notably Stellantis’s Windsor assembly plant) building flexible platforms that can make both types of vehicles. In a possible nod to current political dynamics in the United States – where most Canadian-made vehicles are sold, and where president-elect Donald Trump’s EV skepticism may or may not be counterbalanced by Elon Musk’s role in his administration – Mr. Champagne repeatedly invoked Tesla Inc. as evidence of the need for patience. He did so on the premises that Tesla had plenty of highs and lows before establishing dominance of the early EV space, and that Tesla’s soaring stock price shows that investors retain faith in EVs ultimately taking over the market. Otherwise, he mostly steered away from commenting on the extent to which Mr. Trump’s threat to impose a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian exports could hurt all forms of vehicle-making here, other than to express optimism that Mr. Trump’s sensitivity to markets – which could react negatively to massive disruptions of the highly integrated Canada-U.S. supply chain – will help dissuade him. Actually strengthening that supply chain in the coming years is partly contingent on the natural-resource question – whether Canada can kick-start its mining sector enough to supply not just domestic facilities but also U.S. ones, as industries seek to reduce reliance on China – which contributes to the government’s focus shifting upstream. Mr. Champagne touted a few examples of progress over the past couple of years – particularly at the mid-stream level, such as plans for Canada’s first copper-foil factory and a joint venture by General Motors Co. and Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. to produce cathode active materials, both in Quebec. He also noted the multifaceted nature of Honda’s investment in Ontario, which includes partnerships with Posco and with Asahi Kasei Corp. to make battery components. That could carry extra weight since Honda’s recently announced plan to merge with Nissan Motor Corp. to create the world’s third-largest automaker, which is widely seen as an effort to keep pace with Chinese competitors. And Honda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe hinted to The Globe earlier this year that his company is interested in further investing in this country’s natural resources. But while the effort to get more critical minerals to market does not rest entirely with whoever sits in his chair in cabinet – and is contingent on factors ranging from the federal Natural Resources ministry’s efforts to work with provinces to speed up permitting, to infrastructure investments, to the Finance Ministry’s implementation of mining tax incentives – it now requires the sort of entrepreneurial hustle Mr. Champagne brought to landing the battery plants. He acknowledged that it might have seemed more obvious to start upstream and then move downstream. The economic case for subsidizing the battery plants always rested partly on the establishment of a reliable market for Canadian resources, so it’s a significant hitch that Canada is not yet fully prepared to supply them. But Mr. Champagne contended that there was a narrow window during which the automakers were deciding where to situate the battery plants – which has now almost closed, with most such North American commitments already made – and he had to seize it. The alternative, he suggested, would have been to effectively give up on Canada’s long history of making cars and trucks, which was a real prospect a few years ago as a decades-long decline threatened to be worsened by being left behind in the EV shift. “One of the first briefings I got from officials was basically that [I would be] presiding over the end of the auto sector in Canada gradually,” he said. “And we turned what was a challenge into an opportunity.” Whether Canada’s efforts to position itself as a major player in the electrification of transportation hold up as a win in the long-run, though, will depend on the success of its next phase working backward to build a supply chain – whoever is steering it.
