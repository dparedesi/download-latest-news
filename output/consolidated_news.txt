Title: 21Shares launches crypto index ETFs under SEC’s Act 40
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/21shares-first-crypto-index-etfs-launched-sec-1940-act
Time Published: 2025-11-13T18:42:33Z
Full Content:
21Shares’ new crypto index ETFs utilize the stricter 1940 Act framework, marking a shift toward traditional fund oversight for diversified digital asset exposure. Asset manager 21Shares has launched two cryptocurrency index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a structure that could boost investor confidence by subjecting the products to the same disclosure and governance rules that apply to traditional US investment funds. The new products — the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF (TTOP) and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF (TXBC) — were announced on Thursday. Both offer broad exposure to digital assets by tracking FTSE Russell cryptocurrency indexes and holding a basket of the top crypto assets by market capitalization, rather than investing in a single token. Federico Brokate, 21Shares’ global head of business development, said that index funds have enabled investors to gain diversified exposure to traditional assets, particularly stocks. “The same principle applies to crypto investing,” he said. 21Shares has been highly active in the crypto exchange-traded product market and was recently acquired by FalconX for an undisclosed amount. The company will continue to operate independently under the FalconX umbrella. Related: SEC says proof-of-work mining does not constitute securities dealing The Investment Company Act of 1940 is the regulatory framework that governs US mutual funds and most conventional ETFs, imposing requirements around custody and investor protections. This contrasts with the Securities Act of 1933, which is used for grantor trust structures that hold physical commodities — the model regulators have mainly applied to US spot crypto products to date. As Cointelegraph reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already approved a crypto ETP under the ’33 Act — the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, which launched in September. Until now, the SEC has mainly approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) products under the ’33 Act, rather than as fully regulated, investment-company ETFs under the ’40 Act. Demand for crypto ETFs has been high since spot Bitcoin funds debuted in early 2024. BlackRock has led the pack: Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF amassed roughly $70 billion in assets under management within its first year and a half on the market.

Title: XRP Price Jumps as First U.S. Spot ETF Debuts on Nasdaq, Analysts Predict Rally in Weeks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The XRP market just hit a historic milestone as the first U.S. spot XRP ETF, Canary Capital’s XRPC, officially debuts on Nasdaq, sending bullish shockwaves for the XRP price and other assets in the market. The launch gives traditional investors direct exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, and analysts say this could be the spark that propels prices sharply higher in the coming weeks. Nasdaq has certified the Canary Capital XRP ETF for trading under the ticker XRPC, making it the first fully spot-based XRP ETF in the U.S. The fund holds XRP directly and tracks the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate Index, offering a simple, regulated way for institutions and retail investors to gain exposure without managing wallets or private keys. The ETF’s approval comes after the fund completed its Form 8-A filing with the SEC, clearing key regulatory hurdles. Other heavyweights, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares, also have XRP ETF applications in the pipeline, signaling a second wave of products that could further deepen liquidity and demand. On-chain data already shows shifting behavior ahead of the launch. Exchange inflows are down, suggesting holders are accumulating rather than selling, even as XRP trades around the $2.39–$2.50 zone and consolidates above support near $2.20–$2.40. Popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes XRP is entering the final stages of a major consolidation that could lead to an explosive move within 4–6 weeks. Drawing on historical rallies in 2017 and 2021, he notes that XRP is once again forming a large symmetrical triangle, typically a “compression before expansion” structure. Using Fibonacci projections, Egrag highlights potential long-term targets between $10 and $37, while acknowledging that short-term market sentiment remains cautious. He argues that impatience and emotional selling often precede the biggest upside moves, and that today’s sideways action is more “preparation” than weakness. Institutional narratives are also lining up behind XRP. At Swell 2025, BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein described the XRP Ledger as a scalable rail for trillions of dollars in tokenized assets and cross-border payments, reinforcing XRP’s status as a utility-driven asset rather than a purely speculative token. With the Fed’s December rate decision approaching and risk appetite poised to shift, XRP now sits at the intersection of a powerful trio. Fresh ETF inflows, tightening technical patterns, and growing institutional validation. If these forces align, the XRPC launch may be remembered as the moment XRP’s next major rally truly began.

Title: The most important crypto moments of the year

Time Published: 2025-11-13T17:54:58Z

The most influential crypto events of 2025 included sweeping regulatory moves, ecosystem expansion and the rise of new onchain trends. Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000 in 2025 marked a shift from speculative trading to long-term institutional adoption. Banks and governments began viewing BTC as a strategic reserve asset. The GENIUS Act established a unified US framework for payment stablecoins, mandating 1:1 reserve backing, stricter issuer qualifications and stronger consumer protections. Real-world asset tokenization surpassed $30 billion onchain, driven by tokenized US Treasurys and private credit. Firms such as BlackRock, JPMorgan and Apollo integrated RWAs into DeFi markets. Onchain perpetual futures recorded over $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, with platforms like Hyperliquid achieving speed and depth comparable to centralized exchanges. Bitcoin (BTC) crossing the $100,000 threshold this year carried more symbolic weight than speculative excitement. What was once seen as a speculative asset became a structured part of the global financial system. 2025 has turned out to be a year focused less on hype and more on meaningful progress in infrastructure, regulation, institutional investment and technology. This article highlights the most significant cryptocurrency events of the year. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) brought Bitcoin into the portfolios of asset managers, pension funds and corporate treasuries, pushing it beyond retail markets. Daily ETF inflows became a key indicator of market confidence. Unlike previous cycles driven by high-leverage trading, 2025 saw steady interest from professional investors. Banks began conducting Bitcoin transactions on their own balance sheets. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest bank, made its first proprietary Bitcoin trade in January 2025, purchasing 1 million euros worth of BTC as an experiment. Several countries are also exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves, referring to long-term national holdings of the asset. On March 6, 2025, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a permanent asset fund supported by forfeited BTC. The Czech National Bank has also announced that it is considering adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserves. Did you know? Bitcoin mining firms partner with energy producers to stabilize electrical grids and monetize surplus power. In 2025, stablecoins matured from trading instruments into regulated payment and settlement assets. The GENIUS Act, signed into law on July 18, 2025, established the first comprehensive US federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law clarifies that qualifying payment stablecoins are not securities, creates a unified federal licensing and oversight regime for issuers and requires full 1:1 reserve backing with high-quality, highly liquid assets such as cash and short-term US Treasurys. It also mandates regular public disclosures of reserve composition to ensure transparency and consumer protection. Only approved and qualified entities, such as subsidiaries of insured depository institutions, can now issue stablecoins. These issuers must meet strict standards for capital, liquidity and risk management. The act also includes provisions to protect stablecoin holders in the event of issuer insolvency. While the GENIUS Act drew inspiration from earlier proposals, it strengthened safeguards for financial stability. It addressed concerns about a fragmented monetary system by establishing a clearer and more coordinated regulatory framework for digital dollar payments. In 2025, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization transitioned from experimental pilots to institutional mainstream, with onchain value surpassing $30 billion, representing a 300%-400% increase over three years. US Treasurys and private credit are driving institutional adoption. Launched in March 2024, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) brings US Treasurys onchain through tokenization. BUIDL now holds more than $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) across multiple blockchains and distributes daily interest, backed 1:1 by real-world assets. The benefits of RWA tokenization include fractional ownership, 24/7 liquidity and cross-chain interoperability through protocols such as Chainlink CCIP. Institutions like JPMorgan and Apollo are integrating RWAs into decentralized finance (DeFi), further blurring the boundaries between traditional finance and blockchain. Did you know? Tokenized US Treasurys became one of the fastest-growing categories in DeFi, offering low-risk, onchain yields. In October 2025, DeFi perpetual futures surpassed $1 trillion in monthly trading volume, putting platforms like Hyperliquid on par with centralized crypto exchanges. The daily trading volume for decentralized perpetual contracts averaged around $45.7 billion that month, while onchain open interest rose to $16 billion. This increase reflects sustained market positioning rather than short-lived speculative activity. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade in October enabled permissionless market creation through the staking of 500,000 HYPE tokens. The update decentralized listings and encouraged innovation in new asset classes such as equities and RWAs. The platform’s sub-second execution and deep liquidity have further narrowed the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges. This year, Ethereum reinforced its foundational role in the blockchain ecosystem through strategic upgrades and growing institutional adoption. The Pectra upgrade, activated in May, doubled blob capacity, reduced layer-2 fees and improved transaction throughput. It also raised the validator staking cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, enhancing validator efficiency. In July 2025, spot Ether ETFs attracted $12.1 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), highlighting strong institutional demand. Regulatory clarity from US Securities and Exchange Commission rulings positioned Ethereum as compliant infrastructure for DeFi and RWAs, reinforcing its role as Web3’s resilient settlement layer. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade in December is expected to deliver further PeerDAS optimizations, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term position. Did you know? Corporations are increasingly using private or hybrid Ethereum chains for supply-chain tracking and settlement workflows. Solana’s narrative took a sharply positive turn in 2025. Once criticized for network outages and instability, the network made major strides in reliability and performance. The introduction of Firedancer, a new validator client, enhanced redundancy and processing capacity, reflecting Solana’s focus on large-scale, dependable operations. Institutional and derivatives markets also embraced Solana in 2025. Leading regulated platforms introduced Solana-based futures and options, enabling hedging and arbitrage opportunities that were previously limited to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). This development reinforced Solana’s growing importance in high-volume applications such as onchain trading, gaming and consumer services. The industry faced another reminder in 2025 that security remains a major challenge. With more than $2.17 billion stolen from cryptocurrency services as of Nov. 11, 2025, this year has already proven more devastating than the entirety of 2024 in terms of total losses. A large portion of the stolen funds came from North Korea’s $1.5-billion hack of Bybit. As cryptocurrency becomes more integrated into global finance, security failures now pose systemic risks rather than isolated incidents. The growing sophistication of attackers has mirrored the industry’s own technological progress. In 2025, AI-driven attacks and complex supply chain vulnerabilities led to widespread efforts across the industry to strengthen cybersecurity practices.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist For the second November in a row Joe Schmidt has come back to Dublin with his Australian side, and for the second year in a row he's been a man in demand. Having spent a combined nine years as head coach of Leinster and then Ireland, not to mention his earlier days as a player in Mullingar, the New Zealander has laid a few roots in this country. There’s been time this week to grab dinner with some of his family who are still in Ireland; his son, Tim, is living in Churchtown after returning from a few years in Melbourne, while his brother, Jamie, is based in Blackrock. The Wallabies had a day off on Wednesday, and while some of his players braved the elements for golf in Portmarnock, he grabbed a cup of coffee with his former Ireland team manager Mick Kearney, and he’ll squeeze in a catch-up with his former captain Rory Best tomorrow. Far from getting bogged down after a run of five defeats in six games, a few days in Dublin are releasing the pressure valve. "That's part of the balance," he says, ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Ireland at Aviva Stadium. "To go back to your question, how do you cope with pressure? Well, family is always a great kind of distraction and opportunity to just be able to step outside the bubble you're in, which can eat away at you a little bit and breathe for a few hours. "I remember coming back last year and seeing familiar faces, so I guess there's always comfort and familiarity with a lot of the people, as much as anything. "I got out of an Uber in town yesterday morning and I was with our manager Chris Thompson. The first three people walking past, 'Hey Joe, howya Joe?’ "It’s just a really nice feeling, like you're kind of home. So yeah, I'll miss that." Schmidt (above) recently turned 60-years-old, and will vacate his post as Wallabies head coach in July to hand the baton on to his former Ireland assistant Les Kiss. He doesn’t know what the future holds from a coaching perspective, stressing his reason to step away from the Australia job is to spend more time with his family, and in particular his youngest son Luke, who has had a severe form of epilepsy since he was a child. And so, it’s possible that Saturday’s game will be his final as a coach in Dublin, although he has plans to return to the Aviva in a different capacity some day in the future. "Maybe Terenure, but Carlos [Spencer] has got that job, and I’m so old I coached Carlos. No, I won’t be doing that," he laughs. "I've always thought – and I know this may sound bizarre - but I've always thought when we used to go into the [Aviva] stadium and you drive past the Sandymount Hotel, I’ll look at all those people having pints and really enjoying themselves, and I'm feeling like I'm in this sardine can of pressure. "I'll look out there and I think: ‘One day, I'm going to get amongst those people and then I'm going to drift into that stadium and I'm going to enjoy watching a game where I'm not so emotionally hanging off everything that happens'. "I have been looking forward to finishing for a long time and it was a phone call from a mate of mine that had me end up here [with Australia]. I've got to say I really enjoyed it." Of course, there was a time where he wasn't so popular in Dublin, as he recalled his inauspicious start to coaching Leinster in 2010. "I'll never forget my start in Leinster. You talk about losing in Italy [last week] and losing in Treviso in game four [in 2010]. "The experienced Irish boys had just come back in and apparently I had lost the dressing-room and the first question I was asked at the next press conference was, 'Joe, is this the beginning of the end of Leinster Rugby?' I thought that was a little melodramatic!" Even aside from Schmidt’s time coaching some of these Irish players, there will be a strong familiarity between he and the team. He was part of the All Blacks’ coaching team that knocked Ireland out of the World Cup in 2023, before bringing the Wallabies to Dublin this time last year, and running coming up just short, losing 22-19 to Andy Farrell’s side. Only a few months ago, his Wallabies hosted the British and Irish Lions in Australia, losing the series 2-1 Farrell's side which was heavily populated by Irish players and coaches. Since Farrell’s return to his Irish post, Ireland have struggled to click; beaten by New Zealand in Chicago before a clunky performance in their 41-10 win against Japan. But Schmidt isn't buying the suggestion that this Irish side are struggling. "I think there's some really good glimpses. Not too many teams play 20 minutes without a player, and they're ahead of the All Blacks even after 60 minutes, because those 20 minutes take it out of you. "We played a Test recently against the All Blacks and lost a player for 10 minutes and then another player for 10 minutes, and while you might not lose those two 10 minute blocks, you lose a bit of fuel in the tank because they're always going to stretch you at the back end of the game. "So I felt in that game, as a consequence, it made the back end certainly a bit tougher. "I look at some of the guys who've been selected for this game and were selected last week, and there's some very good boys coming through, like young Paddy McCarthy. "It’s disappointing for Joe [McCarthy] that he's not there, but not disappointing for us that he's not there."

Title: Google's new AI shopping features arrive just in time for a hassle-free holiday season

Agentic calling, 'Buy for me,' and shop with Gemini. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's the holiday season, and Google is rolling out some epic tools to help you find the perfect holiday gift, but here's the catch — with Gemini, so that you don't have to jump several hoops to find that one thing you spotted on social media or that a friend recently wore. Google is making AI Mode do the heavy lifting for you, so users can go beyond simple two-line queries and really get into the details when describing the product they need. Users can now have conversations with AI Mode in Search, much like they would with a store employee in person, describing exactly what they're looking for instead of typing several lines. When you ask AI Mode a shopping question, you’ll not only get results to your search query, but it will also give you the images along with a breakdown of other purchasing details like price, reviews, and inventory info, helping users "quickly and confidently decide what to buy." For instance, if you need some visual inspiration, you can simply say “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors,” and you’ll see shoppable images. By simply asking for "moisturizers suited to your skin type," you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences. Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot. The feature pops up when users ask a shopping-related query. Google says it will give you shopping inspiration for events like Black Friday or holiday lists, providing shoppable product listings, comparison tables, and more. Google's Agentic AI can now find products in stock nearby, saving you the hassle of calling multiple stores and wasting your time being on hold. When you search for products "near me" on Google Search, select "Let Google Call." AI will then call local stores on your behalf to check availability, price, and promos. You'll receive an email or text with the answers, including local inventory from the Shopping Graph. The tech giant says that this feature uses Duplex technology, "with a big Gemini model upgrade that helps us identify the best stores to call, suggest helpful questions to ask based on the product you want and summarize the conversations into key takeaways." Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Holiday sales can be totally overwhelming with so many stores offering huge discounts, and between all that craziness, it's easy to miss out on that dress you've been wanting forever or those pair of shoes that are only on sale for a few days. But that could change, as Google's new "agentic checkout" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget. So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants. If that wasn't enough, Google will then purchase it for you on the merchant's site using Google Pay, obviously after taking necessary permissions from you. This feature combines Gemini models and the Shopping Graph, saving you time and money this holiday season. These agentic shopping features are available in the U.S. starting today (Nov. 13), and Google says it has plans to roll them out to other countries soon.

Title: Deals: M4 MacBook Air $250 off, entry M5 MacBook Pro all-time low, Apple Watch SE 3 $200/Ultra 3 $99 off, more
URL: https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/13/deals-m4-macbook-air-m5-macbook-pro-apple-watch-se-3/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:45:00Z

Today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break is loaded with some big-time Apple price drops. Firstly, the all-time lows at $250 off across the M4 MacBook Air lineup have now returned, and we are now tracking a new Amazon all-time low on the most affordable M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Those offers also join the best prices to date on Apple Watch Ultra 3 Alpine and Trail configs as well as all-time low pricing on the most affordable new Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 at $200. All of that is detailed for you below alongside this $300 price drop Apple’s Space Black 1TB M4 iPad Pro cell model. Deals on Apple’s latest MacBook releases are really starting to heat up as part of the early Black Friday festivities. All of the M4 MacBook Air models have now dropped back down to the lowest prices ever, we caught an upgraded M5 MacBook Pro at a new all-time low yesterday, and Amazon just served up the lowest price to date on the most affordable new M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Amazon is now offering the 14-inch Space Black M5 MacBook Prowith 16GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,481 shipped. Regularly $1,599, this is a new Amazon all-time low and the best price we have tracked yet in new condition with $118 slashed from the list. We recently featured a series of exclusive discounts on Apple’s brand new M5 machine – most of those offers remain the lowest prices we have seen to date, but Amazon has now picked it up a notch to deliver the lowest prices anywhere on the new 16GB models, including both the 512GB and 1TB storage options: We caught some early and quite impressive $99 price drops on the brand new Apple Watch Ultra 3 as part of the major early Black Friday offers. At the time that was largely just for Costco members or only on the new Ocean Band configurations elsewhere, but this morning Amazon has put a number of the Alpine and Trail Loop at $99 off as well. Amazon is still offering the same price drops we featured previously on the Ocean Band models, but you will now find a selection of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 configswith the new 2025 Alpine Loop and Trail Loops marked down to $699.99 shipped – a new Amazon all-time low price at $99 under the regular $799 list price. As you can see in the list above, we are also adding the Natural Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the matching Natural Titanium Milanese Loop to the list as well. This one, as you likely already know, fetches a premium because of the higher-end metal Milanese Loop, but it is also now $99 off and sitting at the best price we have ever tracked on Amazon. While not a perfect comparison because it was effectively just a new black color last year, the best official deal we tracked on Apple Watch Ultra 2 (currently down at $650) for Black Friday 2024 was the $80 price drop ushered in by Best Buy’s Black Friday Doorbusters and over at Amazon. We could see the series 3 go for less, but landing Apple’s brand new flagship wearable at nearly $100 off is certainly a solid price drop this soon after release. We caught our very first deal on Apple’s new Midnight 44mm Midnight SE 3 wearable the other day. It went completely out of stock before making a return yesterday – it is still live at the moment – and now the most affordable Midnight model in the new collection is live at its $199.99 all-time low. Amazon is now offering the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 in the Midnight colorway down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $249, this is nearly $49 off and the best price we have ever tracked. While this one did drop to the same $200 we have here now at a few days ago, it almost immediately went out of stock and remained unavailable until this morning. Considering almost no one had a chance at this deal earlier in the week, today’s offer is effectively the first chance to score a notable price drop on the most affordable Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 – the most affordable 2025 Apple Watch – and a new Amazon all-time low. This year’s new Apple Watch SE model is the most compelling model Apple has ever released if you ask me. It is, by and large, for just about anyone but the most hardcore users, effectively an Apple Watch Series 10 with less color options. It runs on the same S10 chip and finally supports an always-on display (a must-have for me) as well as double-tap and wrist-flick gesture support. It’s clearly not a Series-grade Apple Watch, but starting at $200 it’s awfully close and much more affordable – the most affordable Series 11 starts at $389 on Amazon. Amazon is landing this morning with one of the best discounts we have ever tracked on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While we have seen a countless number of opportunities to save big on iPhone 16 Pro configurations, particularly deep 16 Pro Max offers have been a little bit harder to come by. However, this morning you’ll find the 1TB Black Titanium model at $540 off the original list price. Amazon is now offering the Black Titanium 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max down at $1,059 shipped in Renewed Premium condition with a 1-year warranty and a 90-day return guarantee. You’re looking at a spec’d out, upgraded iPhone 16 Pro Max that released in late 2024 at $1,599. While Apple no longer sells this model, as it has been replaced by the 17 Pro Max for the same price, this is indeed $540 off the price you would have paid for it straight from Apple not more than a couple months ago. And all things considered, if it has taken this long for Amazon to serve up an all-time low price on the 16 Pro, you might be waiting until this time next year to see the same on the 17 Pro/Max. The $1,059 asking price here might seem like a lot for a renewed iPhone, but this is the highest-quality refurb Amazon offers and one of the best sources for relatively new iPhone deals there is. I might even suggest it is the best way to land an unlocked iPhone 16 Pro/Max anywhere, even if you have the cash to buy a brand new unit. For more insight on what Apple’s latest handset releases deliver, here’s our hands-on review of the new iPhone 17 Pro. With all of the new M5 talk and fancy new Apple Watch releases, and the all-new AirPods Pro 3, never mind the all-time low pricing on M4 MacBook Air models, one of the best and most value-packed current-generation machines might be slipping under your radar – M4 Mac mini. I have been raving about this machine for a long while now, and with early Black Friday pricing now live, and our recent follow-up video review after 1 year in the lab, we wanted to make sure these deals are front and center. There’s no denying how convenient a MacBook can be – it is effectively just as good a home office computer as it is a portable solution – but it’s going to cost you a whole lot more than the Mac mini. And while I certainly value the freedom Apple’s battery-powered Macs provide, the M4 Mac mini has been the best and most useful Apple purchase I have made in recent memory. If you need to be able to pick up and go with your Mac system, then the Mac mini clearly isn’t for you, but if you don’t or you’re just looking to land a solid new at-home setup without completely running up the credit card, there’s simply nothing better if you ask me. You can get the same on-screen macOS experience as the MacBook for $250 less than the most affordable current-generation MacBook, and that’s with the all-time low Black Friday pricing right now.

Title: ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry deregisters Scion hedge fund amid bets against AI titans
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/business/big-short-investor-michael-burry-deregisters-scion-hedge-fund-amid-bets-against-ai-titans/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:32:20Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry, the investor whose successful bets against the US housing market in 2008 were recounted in the movie “The Big Short,” is closing his hedge fund, Scion Asset Management. In a letter to investors dated Oct. 27, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Burry said he would liquidate the funds and return capital, “but for a small audit/tax holdback” by the end of the year. A person directly familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the letter. “My estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets,” Burry said in the letter. Burry could not be immediately reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s database showed Scion’s registration status as “terminated” as of Nov. 10. Deregistering would imply the fund is not required to file reports with the regulator or any state. Investment funds that manage more than $100 million of capital are required to register with the SEC. Bets by Scion, which managed $155 million in assets as of March, have long been dissected for hints of looming bubbles and signs of market froth. In a post on social media platform X on Wednesday, Burry said, “On to much better things Nov 25th.” Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Burry, who was famously featured in the book and movie ‘The Big Short’, has stepped up criticism of technology heavyweights, including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, in recent weeks, questioning the cloud infrastructure boom and accusing major providers of using aggressive accounting to inflate profits from their massive hardware investments. In his post on X, Burry said he spent about $9.2 million buying up about 50,000 put options on Palantir, saying that the options would allow him to sell the stock at $50 apiece in 2027. The put options convey the right to sell shares at a set price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view. Palantir’s shares were trading at $178.29 on Thursday, giving the company a market value of $422.36 billion. So, I bought 50,000 of these things for $1.84.Each of those things is 100 doodads. So I spent $9,200,000, Not $912,000,000. @CNBC @WSJ @FTEach of those doodads let me sell $PLTR at $50 in 2027. That was done last month. On to much better things Nov 25th. pic.twitter.com/9Voy3nwiTD Last month, Burry posted an image of his character from ‘The Big Short’ movie and warned of bubbles, saying that, “Sometimes the only winning move is not to play.” “Burry’s decision feels less like ‘calling it quits’ and more like stepping away from a game he believes is fundamentally rigged,” said Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management. Burry, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has argued that as companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet-owned Google, Oracle and Meta pour billions into Nvidia chips and servers, they are also quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Between 2026 and 2028, those accounting choices could understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported profits across the sector, he estimated. AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of the S&P 500 index’s returns since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, JPMorgan Asset Management wrote in September. “Don’t count him out, just expect him to operate off the grid for a while. He may simply pivot to a family-office setup and run his own capital,” said Schneller. The investor’s short position against subprime mortgage securities during the housing market crash was chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book, “The Big Short,” and its film adaptation. His profile on X, titled “Cassandra Unchained,” is seen as a nod to the Greek mythological figure cursed by Apollo to deliver true prophecies that no one would believe. Investment advisers with assets under management of $100 million or more have to register with the SEC, and are primarily subject to federal regulation instead of state regulation. Burry’s Scion ended last year with shares in American Coastal, Bruker, Canada Goose, HCA Healthcare, Magnera, Molina Healthcare, Oscar Health and VF Corp, but the firm ended those bets earlier this year. During the quarter ended June 30, Burry’s Scion Asset Management was more bullish on companies across different sectors and geographies, after betting against Chinese companies previously as the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs. Burry, who launched Scion Asset Management in 2013, joins a cast of high-profile investors navigating a market that has become increasingly hostile to bearish views in recent years, thanks to unfettered optimism around technology and strong interest from retail investors. Hindenburg Research shuttered earlier this year after a string of high-profile calls, including bets against India’s Adani Group and electric-truck maker Nikola. Veteran short seller Jim Chanos, best known for his bets against energy trader Enron months before the company’s bankruptcy, has also sparred with Michael Saylor’s bitcoin holding company Strategy. Chanos has argued that Strategy’s valuation premium was unjustified, a critique that drew a sharp response from Saylor. Advertisement

For a long time, I thought prediction markets, “superforecasting”, and AI forecasting techniques had nothing to say about the stock market. Stock prices already reflect the collective wisdom of investors. The stock market is basically a prediction market already.Recently, though, AI forecasting has gotten competitive with human forecasters. And we’ve found a way of modeling long-term company outcomes that is amenable to our forecasting approach.Iteration by iteration, my skepticism has turned to light distrust, and then into actually getting value out of our company forecasts. Like most AI companies, we draw from improvements against our LLM-agent benchmarks, Deep Research Bench and Bench to the Future.But at the end of the day, to evaluate it, I think it’s best to follow Charlie Munger’s advice: try to disprove what Stockfisher says. Now, even after an hour of carefully reading through a stock, I generally can’t find any major flaws, and I hear the same from other serious investors.And, since it’s software, not human analysis, we applied it at scale. We have long-term forecasts for revenue, margins, and payout ratios for every company in the S&P 500.We do a Buffett-style intrinsic valuation, that doesn’t take the stock price into account. This means you can sort by the difference between what the stock market says, and what Stockfisher says. Some very interesting neglected companies rise to the top, and we’re starting to process the mid-caps and small-caps too.Stockfisher is live at https://platform.stockfisher.app, no sign in required, to see what we have on the top stocks. (I was happy to see Alphabet comes out well. Meta looks good too, but Amazon and Apple do not.) I would love for you to judge for yourself if the quality of analysis is up to your standards.

But they do get certain things right. And if you figure out the patterns of what types of manager promises tend to play out, and assess them individually for their reliability, you can reason about these business model changes decently well. reply reply The most interesting aspect of this is backtesting. Quant models get run on past data to see if their predictions work.When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world. And then there's the fact that they do their research on the open internet. It makes backtesting hard - but not impossible.We wrote about how we do our pastcasting validation here: https://stockfisher.app/backtesting-forecasts-that-use-llms When you use LLMs agents, though, you run into their memorized knowledge of the world.

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Digital Asset Treasuries

Time Published: 2025-11-13T16:00:00Z

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3,168.38, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$141.23, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock.

You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Aaron Brogan from Brogan Law breaks down the history and business model of digital asset treasuries. Then, in "Ask an Expert", DJ Windle from Windle Wealth answers questions that advisors need to know about crypto treasury companies. – Sarah Morton Digital asset treasury (DAT) companies offer public crypto exposure, but how much hype are you buying? The digital asset treasury (DAT) company is a new invention with a long history. They are public companies pursuing an explicit priority of purchasing digital assets. Back in 1989, Michael Saylor founded MicroStrategy (now Strategy) as a software business. It achieved some success and went public in 1998, only to spectacularly implode in 2000, lose more than 99% of its market cap, and catch an SEC investigation. Improbably, though, Strategy did not go bankrupt in 2000, and continues to offer obscure software and services today. The magic happened elsewhere, though. In 2020, the firm began purchasing bitcoin, and it hasn’t stopped. At first, its approach appeared to be rabid evangelism. Saylor would buy bitcoin, go on TV and convince others to buy bitcoin, and that would drive the company’s investment up. But over time, another phenomenon appeared. As Strategy bought more and more bitcoin, and the price of bitcoin climbed ever higher, Strategy increasingly became a box of bitcoins with a vestigial software company stapled onto it. At this point, its share price and market cap should have converged to the price of bitcoin, but it didn’t. It traded at a premium. When this happened, promoters stirred from their hoards like Smaug, and the DAT was born. This multiple of a DATs net asset value (NAV) and its market cap, known as its multiple of NAV (mNAV), creates a special kind of power. If you can buy an asset for $1, and increase your market cap by $2, then you should do nothing else. You can sell equity, and indeed raise debt, and put it to immediate direct productive use accreting shareholder value. As long as this relationship holds, it is, in essence, a money printer. And so as Strategy ran this playbook over time, others took notice. They started to get the idea that maybe they could follow it, and make their own DAT. Some used BTC, like Mara Holdings, Inc., but over time others tried it with other assets like Ether ETH$3 168,38, held by Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., and Solana SOL$141,23, held by Forward Industries, Inc., as well. Source: Galaxy Research For the promoters of these projects, the value proposition is clear. Asymmetric increases in equity value, coupled with public trading, lead to quick profits. BTC has always been highly liquid, but for virtually all other digital assets, creating a public sink to purchase tokens presents the dazzling potential to increase asset values and provide exit liquidity in a single stroke. This is a major reason that the meta has gained so much traction recently. It is good for bagholders. But what about purchasers? Well, getting access to a DAT stock before its mNAV grows is good, as the company implements its strategy and, hopefully, gains value, equity holders may see gains. But for an ordinary buyer on public markets, after a positive mNAV is established, the value proposition is speculative. You are buying a premium on the underlying asset, and that premium could easily fade. Historically, access to Strategy was valuable to institutional advisors who were hesitant or legally unable to purchase bitcoin directly for their clients. They could hold Strategy instead. But as old taboos fade, and regulatory disapprobation with it, this proposition may lose luster. At the same time, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that skip the step of wrapping a treasury in an operating company have been approved recently, further diluting DAT’s advantage. There is also the regulatory question. Strategy is not a ‘40 Act Fund because BTC is not a security, but it is not obvious that the same reasoning would apply to DATs holding other assets. A future administration unfriendly to the industry could test the operating company exemption on which they rely. To the extent that DATs use leverage to acquire assets, future market instability could lead to liquidations, increasing risk. Premiums, too, may be collapsing even now. Chart: Strategy performance vs. bitcoin (Source: strategtracker.com) For advisors, understanding these different risk vectors is critical to advising clients on a DAT buying strategy. Regulatory risk is unlikely to be significant in the current environment, but premium collapse could be, so understanding a DAT’s mNAV at purchase is critical to evaluating its risk profile. Leverage, too, can increase risk profile. Finally, DATs may change strategy more readily than a comparable ETP, and so monitoring developments in management is another important factor to consider. - Aaron Brogan, founder and managing attorney, Brogan Law Q: What should advisors understand before clients start asking about digital asset treasury companies? A: Advisors don’t need to master every nuance of on-chain finance, but they do need to grasp what makes a digital asset treasury (DAT) company behave differently from a traditional stock. These companies hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets, and their share prices often move with those assets rather than their business fundamentals. When clients bring them up, they’re really asking: “Is this a safe way to own crypto in my brokerage account?” The best preparation is to understand that DATs function as leveraged proxies for digital assets. They can trade far above (or below) the value of their holdings depending on market sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Being able to explain that dynamic clearly separates education from hype. Q: How can advisors evaluate whether a DAT makes sense for a portfolio? A: Start with what drives the stock. A DAT’s share price reflects not just the value of its crypto treasury but also investor sentiment, leverage, and liquidity. Advisors should review three things: Advisors can then reframe client enthusiasm around fundamentals. Is the goal diversified exposure or speculation on a premium? That distinction determines whether a DAT belongs anywhere near a client’s portfolio. Q: What should advisors be ready to explain when clients compare DATs to spot ETFs? A: This will be the most common question. The answer is that spot ETFs hold the digital asset directly, trade close to net asset value, and operate under clear regulation. DATs, on the other hand, are companies using corporate balance sheets to hold those same assets and sometimes using debt to do it. That means the potential upside can look exciting, but the risk profile is closer to a leveraged stock than an ETF.

Title: ‘Israel Did Not Kill Charlie Kirk. That Is Insane!’: The World According to Hasan Piker

Photographs by Dan Doperalski Hasan Piker is about to prove his point. For weeks, the wildly popular Twitch streamer and leftist commentator has been following the online discourse surrounding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The topic is personal for Piker, who was scheduled to debate Kirk at Dartmouth College 15 days after the right-wing political activist was gunned down on a Utah campus. Authorities charged college student Tyler Robinson with the crime, but lately, a civil war has erupted among conservatives over conspiratorial claims that the Mossad had a hand in the murder. “You would be surprised at how many people believe that stuff,” he says as he mulls the menu options at a crowded Chelsea restaurant on a brisk October morning. Related Stories 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'-Magic: The Gathering Collaboration Set Unveils Seven New Cards: Zuko, Iroh and More (EXCLUSIVE) When our waiter arrives, Piker turns to the 20-something hipster. “Can I ask you a question? Who is the most likely person that killed Charlie Kirk?” he asks. “I think it was Israel. It seems like an inside job,” the server replies hesitantly before heading back to the kitchen for Piker’s cold brew. Popular on Variety The answer comes as a shock to me. But it’s no surprise to the extremely online millennial who acknowledges that he is fascinated by conspiracy theories. “I watch every Candace Owens,” Piker says, referring to the new-media star of the far right who has fanned the flames of the Israel theory. He nods in the direction of our waiter: “It’s the reason why I know exactly where he is coming from with the Charlie-Israel thing. For me, no matter how far-fetched the conspiracy is, if it is getting 2 million views in 24 hours, that means a lot of people are tuning in to it. That means a lot of people are paying attention to it. And in this day and age, I think a lot of people are believing it.” Piker feels no allyship with Owens even if they share the belief that Israel is a malignant force. He is merely a student of the attention economy, a space in which he is thriving. With nearly 3 million followers on Twitch and 1.75 million YouTube subscribers, the 34-year-old influencer seems like a possible answer to the question of when the left will find its own Joe Rogan. As the next generation turns more conservative and alpha males like Andrew Tate ascend, Piker offers an alternative vision and the rare ability to sway an election. As an early and enthusiastic supporter of Zohran Mamdani, Piker played a key role in helping catapult the New York mayoral candidate to Gracie Mansion by spreading the Democrat’s socialist message to his legion of fans. With our waiter out of earshot, Piker drops his voice discreetly. “Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. That is insane!” he says. “I did that for you because you were shocked.” When the waiter returns with our order, he tells Piker that he is comping the cold brew. “Wait, why?” Piker asks. “I just like your vibe,” the server says. A lot of people like Piker’s vibe. His brand — a two-fold critique of Israel and the billionaire class — has made him a multimillionaire. And a foil. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has accused him of using his platform to promote “toxic anti-Zionism.” Andrew Cuomo invoked Piker’s name repeatedly along the campaign trail in an effort to smear Mamdani. On this morning, Piker has just arrived via red-eye from his home in Los Angeles for an appearance at the New Yorker Festival; his inclusion in the lineup already sparked a wave of outrage. Wearing a no-logo sweatshirt, sweatpants, a “Free Palestine” wristband and an Apple watch and carrying a small Gucci bag that holds his Zyn supply, Piker signals a cross between conspicuous consumption and Bernie bro. Lurking beneath a camo hat emblazoned with the word “Thieves” is a mind that poses one of the biggest PR threats to the pro-Israel set. The Jersey-born, Istanbul-raised, Rutgers-educated provocateur has no plans to back down. “These last two years, I’ve been called antisemitic. I abhor antisemitism, and I’ve spent my entire professional media career combating it. I just happen to be anti-Israel, and that makes me a far greater threat than the likes of Nick Fuentes because they know he’s a Nazi,” he says, referring to yet another polarizing figure in the ongoing schism within the far right. “I don’t find kinship with the right because I think there are some on the right that just use Israel as a new opportunity to cut through the noise.” His voice, famous from 2,674 livestreams — or 18,624 hours in front of a camera — since he started on Twitch in 2018, is steady and evokes the East Coast liberal arts poli sci education he received. “Maybe they see kinship with me, but I’ve been there for decades,” he says. “Because this is a problem that predates Oct. 7. That’s why a lot of people in the know shortly after Oct. 7, myself included, were like, ‘This is horrifying.’ But the reasons as to why this is happening is because of 75 years of apartheid at that point, the genocide that was the inception of the Israeli nation-state. And most people were just so oblivious to that reality. They were like, ‘How dare you say something so barbaric? How dare you say something instead of just sitting there silently and mourning?’ But there has never been a moment in my life where I ever considered Israel to be anything but a criminal enterprise.” Hanging with Hasan plays out a bit like one of his marathon streams on Twitch, a hybrid of live television and social media that allows creators to interact with fans via chat. The hours float by as he flits from one topic to the next, a mix of politics and pop culture. He’s disgusted by Hollywood’s treatment of pro-Palestinian voices who have lost career opportunities, such as “Scream” actress Melissa Barrera (whose firing from the franchise happened, he says, at “the peak of the panic”). Some have been dropped by their agencies, including Susan Sarandon (“Love her”) by UTA, or their labels, like Roger Waters (“He’s awesome”), over their Israel critiques. More recently, British punk rap duo Bob Vylan was cut by UTA for leading chants of “Death to the IDF” during a performance at Glastonbury Festival. “I don’t think that is necessarily going too far,” Piker says of Bob Vylan’s actions. “I think the moment that you start talking about Jewish control or the Talmud is when people go too far. As a Muslim who sees so much Islamophobia, I’m very tuned in to that dog whistle, like the overemphasis on sharia.” (The notion that Mamdani would impose sharia law on New York was indicative of the tenor of the final stretch of the mayoral race.) “They do it to Jewish people as well in a similar vein. I think that’s when people go too far.” From Piker’s perspective, Amy Schumer should have been canceled for social media posts she made in the wake of Oct. 7. “Amy was going crazy — and no punishments there. She was just straight-up being like, ‘They’re all rapists, barbaric monsters. They’re head choppers. We got to deal with them.’” (Piker appears to be referencing an illustration Schumer shared and then deleted on Instagram that depicted pro-Palestinian supporters holding signs with such slogans as “Gazans rape Jewish girls only in self defense” and “Proud of our rapist martyrs.”) Despite calls for his cancellation for his criticism of Israel, Piker has withstood the heat. “WME didn’t drop me, which I think is very interesting,” he says. He was told to tone it down, but he’s vague about exactly who told him. “‘He’s getting a little too hot’ is what I heard,” he says. Did he heed that warning? “No, because I’m very stubborn, and if something is wrong, I’m going to call it out, and if I can’t call it out, then I can’t do my job. That’s my job. That’s what I do. So yes, I’ve gotten warnings, and I’m not oblivious.” Journalist Taylor Lorenz, a friend of Piker’s who has covered the subject of internet harassment for 15 years, says that he is unique in the breadth of his haters, from Vice President JD Vance to Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres. “Hasan has a very particular strain of politics, which is leftism that is attacked by both mainstream centrist Democrats, bad-faith left-wing actors, the right wing and just internet trolls,” Lorenz says. “And he’s on the most dramatic platform possible, Twitch, which has the most parasocial fan base of any platform. He gets the entire internet weaponized against him. He is the only straight man I’ve ever seen that has been Gamergated.” Earlier this year, Mamdani’s mother, director Mira Nair, signed a petition calling for the Academy to rescind its invitation to Gal Gadot to appear at the Oscars for “her support for Israel’s military actions against Palestinians.” Given that Gadot’s comments throughout the conflict have centered on releasing the hostages, I ask Piker if such a campaign was fair. “I think she should be banned from the Oscars for being a dogshit actress. I think she has no business being there for the crime of what she has done to not only the DC franchise, but really any movie she’s been a part of,” he says of the “Wonder Woman” star. “All jokes aside, Gal Gadot serves an important role in normalizing Israel as not a fascist ethno-state, but instead a place where a lot of beautiful women come from. And those beautiful women happen to serve in the IDF, because there’s also this weird sexualization of the forces as well that takes place, and it plays another role in normalizing Israel and its activities and actions, and whitewashing it.” By contrast, Piker appreciates the work of Natalie Portman, who is Israeli but never served in the IDF like Gadot. “If Gal Gadot could act like Natalie Portman, there’re probably less people yelling at her. Natalie Portman has made statements about Israel that are middle of the road, but ultimately nobody holds that against her. Because she can act her freaking face off, all the way back when she was like a teenager. Oh my God, ‘Léon: The Professional.’” Gadot may have ruined the DC franchise for Piker, but James Gunn is redeeming it. When “Superman” opened on July 11, Piker made viral the idea that the fictional nation of Boravia is a stand-in for Israel. In the film, Boravia, backed by U.S.-made weaponry, drops bombs on and oppresses its desert neighbor, prompting Superman to intercede. Gunn has since denied that the plotline has “anything to do with the Middle East.” “James Gunn is a lot more woke than he lets on. And he lets on how woke he is all the time,” Piker says, still certain of the director and DC chief’s intention all these months later. “Come on, man, you made the [Boravian leader] look like David Ben-Gurion. He just straight-up looks one-to-one like the first prime minister of Israel. We don’t even care what you say about this. We know exactly what we’re looking at.” To take the allegory a step further, Palantir, BlackRock and Raytheon are LuthorCorp. “Lex Luthor is cutting a direct contract with Boravia to extract natural resources and then also have a testing ground for their weapons,” Piker says. “I mean, that’s literally what we do. Gaza is a weapons laboratory. That’s how imperialism works.” Apropos of something, Piker then gives a thumbs-up to the actor who suited up as the latest Man of Steel. “David Corenswet, from what I understand, is Jewish, and he’s very cool. He’s not like pro-Israel or anything like that either, as far as I’ve seen,” he notes. With that, Piker is ready to move on to cross-Burbank superhero rival Marvel. But there’s little for him to mine on that front. “I’ve always been a Marvel fan growing up, but I cannot stand the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” he says. Piker’s intensity is palpable as he chases a double espresso with a 6 mg Zyn pouch. All that’s missing is the scroll of chat comments accompanying his musings. Instead, swooning fans enter the real-life frame to express their gratitude. A woman dining with her son approaches our table. “No, no, it’s impossible. He lives in L.A.,” she says, beaming. “And then I kept looking and looking and … it’s him! I absolutely love your work.” “Being a Twitch streamer is a lot of that,” he says of his exchange with the server. “I have my ear to the ground all the time. A lot of people in legacy media, traditional journalists, are so out of step with the average person around them, even in their immediate vicinity.” Still, Piker allows the rich and powerful to occupy plenty of space in his head. Bari Weiss, the recently installed editor-in-chief of CBS News, gets a bashing. “Bari Weiss is everything that I despise about access journalism brown-nosing to institutionally powerful people and a major advocate for Israel as well. A person that has spent her entire career decrying woke or identity politics while simultaneously using her identity as a shield,” he says. “Like, ‘I’m a lesbian woman. I can’t be intolerant.’ And also even using your identity as a Jewish woman to say, ‘Identity politics sucks unless we’re talking about Jewish people.’” Piker scoffs at the idea that CBS News was biased before Weiss arrived. “There’s not enough pro-Israel voices in major news? Come on. That’s ridiculous,” he says. “Yet she’s been rewarded handsomely for it — $150 million for her shitty Substack that no one cares about or knows about. It’s very obvious why that happened. The Redstones [the seller] and the Ellisons [the buyer] wanted to make CBS more pro-Israel. Shari Redstone was willing to hand off CBS to the Ellisons because she thought they would do a better job of making it more pro-Israel.” (When the Paramount deal was announced in August, Redstone said Ellison “has a clear strategic vision and the resources to take [the studio] to its next stage of growth.”) Since the deal closed, the studio has made a series of moves that bolster Piker’s contention that Paramount is now more Israel-friendly. In September, it denounced a petition signed by celebrities including Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. Last month, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil interviewed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. “Bari Weiss was being packaged as someone who could bring top talent. Wow,” Piker says. “Benjamin Netanyahu never gives interviews anymore to American news? He talks to American news more than he does the Israeli news.” Perhaps it’s Piker’s complete lack of filter that makes him so attractive to his growing fan base. Most influencers with a red-hot career are careful not to bite a Hollywood hand that could feed them. As a result, these aspiring stars tend to punch down. Piker is willing to punch way up. All the way up to Larry Ellison, the second-richest person on the planet, who backed his son David’s successful bid to buy Paramount and also has a stake in TikTok. Piker is trying to explain the craven flip of the once-liberal tech titan to the Republican side. “When Larry Ellison first made that big donation to Marco Rubio [for his presidential run in 2016], people were actually a bit confused. I think he’s gay. Maybe in the closet. I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t laser me down for speculating,” he says with a laugh about the Oracle co-founder. (Larry Ellison has been married to six women and is currently wed to Jolin Zhu.) “But there are [hacked] emails that show Larry Ellison vetted Marco Rubio for fealty to Israel. And as secretary of state, Rubio played a role in the TikTok talks and steered the company towards Ellison.” Piker doesn’t seem too concerned about the prospect of getting “lasered down” by any vengeful oligarch. “I’m also not a stranger to super powerful social media platform-owning billionaires directly hating me and making it a personal vendetta and their life’s mission to destroy me somehow,” he says. In the wake of the Kirk assassination, Elon Musk took to his X to call for Piker’s cancellation, dredging up past comments that walked up to the line. Musk even tagged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (Amazon owns Twitch). Piker notes the irony that he’s not even banned on X, never mind Twitch, because he’s a power user and drives engagement. “A lot of these guys are very thin-skinned, and I think the gravest mistake of my career was when I had [Musk’s ex-partner] Grimes on my show and she talked about how buff I was, and then I talked about how Tesla was shit,” Piker says. “That man has never lived it down.” Grimes wasn’t exaggerating. Piker is hard to miss with his muscular 6-foot-4 frame. He works out one to two hours a day, a regimen that includes playing basketball. If he ingratiated himself better with the oligarchs, he would be courted by mainstream Hollywood. He’s already heard the siren call and turned it down. His manager, former WME agent David Huntzinger, fielded a $1 million offer from one popular betting platform to run a ticker ad during just one stream on election night 2024. Piker said no. “I’m not the easiest client. And not even because I get into trouble,” Piker explains. “I say no all the time to a lot of deals, like a lot of money. And that’s why I really respect David, because throughout our entire professional relationship, he has probably said no to tens of millions of dollars. Starting number was $1 million, which means they could have probably gone up.” He’s happier helping the Mamdanis of the Democratic Party and sticking a thorn in the side of the Cuomo types. “He brought up my name next to Hamas. He said [during a debate with Mamdani], ‘Why don’t you denounce Hamas? Why don’t you denounce Hasan Piker?’” Piker says of the former Democratic governor turned Independent mayoral candidate. “I’m very similar to Zohran in many respects, and the same reasons why they would be resentful of Zohran or fearful of Zohran is the same reason why they despise me.” With the election just 10 days away, Piker is keeping a low profile with the Mamdani campaign. “I’m in a holding pattern right now” he says, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice. “I don’t want to be too prominent in and around the Zohran stuff at the moment because I don’t want them to use it as a line of attack over and over again.” What the Cuomo campaign used was a sound bite of Piker saying, “America deserved 9/11” during a 2019 stream. “I was talking about blowback, a theory that has academic consensus at this point, that our meddling in the affairs of the Middle East has led to the blowback of 9/11,” he explains. “This wasn’t to say 9/11 is good. It’s a horrifying act of terror where 3,000 New Yorkers were slaughtered and even many more with the first responders that tried to save as many people as possible. Yet it was, of course, weaponized against me.” But as election night swung Mamdani’s way, Piker wasn’t keeping a low profile but toasting the millennial mayor-elect with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Brooklyn Paramount victory party. There he offered no mercy for Cuomo. “What happened? I thought the ‘Hasan loves 9/11’ was a successful campaign strategy?” he said in a video that ran on his YouTube channel. “Andrew Cuomo, fuck you. Suck my dick.” Before the Mamdani win becomes a reality, however, Piker can only hope the polls are accurate. But he’s feeling confident as we walk along a busy stretch of 10th Avenue. An older man wearing a bandanna and hoop earrings stops in his tracks and claps as he recognizes Piker. It’s a sign that the streamer’s message about Mamdani and/or Israel is resonating. Then, it hits me that Piker has no security detail as he mingles with the masses. Post-Kirk, that seems unwise. “I make it a point not to have bodyguards when I’m around the people,” he says. “I think it was, was it Fidel Castro or Che Guevara who said, ‘I have a moral vest’?” It was Castro.

Title: The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) Is “Counterfeit Libertarianism”

The American Enterprise Institute (AEI). Framed as a right-wing conservative think tank originally organized in 1938, AEI is yet another political bipartisan NGO with a stated mission to improve American freedom and democrat capitalism via prolonged wars. Thought leaders and scholars are billed as saints and prophets whose words of wisdom must be absorbed without critical question as they guide the US thru an illusion of grandeur. In reality, AEI is a conglomerate of every neoconservative war hawk to walk this earth. At the forefront of their research is the full blown rhetoric of China Bad and Putin is an Antisemite parlayed under the guise that they are Libertarian in their beliefs and motives. And from these very politically motivated two points they define the means of global disruption and nuclear war. Funding includes such sources as Bill Gates, Charles Koch Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, The Carlyle Group, Bradley Foundation, etc. Working in alignment with the coup operatives National Endowment for Democracy and Center For Strategic and International Studies, AEI is simply another cog in the dementia world of coups, regime change, riots, and geoengineered weather wars. While funding planned parenthood, these prophets and scholars assert that intelligence is hereditary, therefore, eugenics is the answer and vaccines are the means. DNA derived bioweapons. In 2003, AEI launched NGO Watch in collaboration with the Federalist Society For Law and Public Policy Studies. The purpose statements claims NGO Watch will provide greater transparency to bring accountability to the NGO sector. It went defunct in 2007 and was relaunched in 2009 with Jewish Zionist Jon Entine as its editor. It goes without saying that NGO Watch was formed by two NGO’s. The wolf watching the chicken coup… (yes I am aware of the spelling). In essence the NGO’s are a composite of neoconservative vs neoliberal with the common goal of micro-managing the White House. It is fair to say that since taking office, President Trump has not leaned on the libertarian policies as outlined in Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. The Project called for elimination of entire federal departments, merit based workers, defunding NIH, flat tax, smaller government, less, less. None of which happened. Heritage president, Kevin Roberts, was recently forced to ‘apologize’ for defending Tucker Carlson’s interview with Nick Fuentes. After a series of resignations from the Heritage Foundation, condemnations from Jewish Republican figures, and a letter of demands from the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, Kevin Roberts apologized for allowing Carlson and Fuentes Free Speech. The Mises Institute, a Libertarian Movement, that holds to the last vestige of pure Libertarianism details the train wreck that became President Trump in his anti-Libertarian principles and policies. President of the Mises Institute, Thomas DiLorenzo, remains pure to the identity and is highly critical of the neoconservatism and military interventionism advocated for by AEI and its CSIS and NED affiliates. There are now over 1.5 million US NGO’s all exclaiming their expert scholarly status whether an adjunct to the right or the left. Unfortunately, outside of Mises, the entity that was Libertarian no longer exists. The ideology has been hijacked by neoconservatives bent on War – in complete contrast to the most basic tenets of Libertarianism, and by the Jewish Money Changers supporting those wars. They wear masks, they carry big sticks, and they wield destruction as the solution to the New Age of the Georgia GuideStones. Every year they congregate at Sea Island, Georgia for their World Forum in private to plan their next attack on a sovereign nation. Today, that attack would be the geoengineering of a severe drought in Iran. Regime change in Venezuela. The genocide of Lebanon by Israel. And giving US tax dollars to grifters such as Zelenskyy and Milei. In 2024, to prove their subservience to the deep state, the AEI World Forum meeting was a roundtable of both Biden Democrats, Obama Democrats, Hillary Democrats, The BlackRock entourage and Bush/Zionist Republicans comprising the Uniparty. The terms ‘conservative’ or ‘right leaning’, no longer direct a reality but instead use the terms to direct an illusion. Trump is not making America Great. He is not a conservative or Libertarian. He is making America a pariah nation triggering constant CHAOS with support from neoconservative and Zionist NGO’s. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: BNY Eyes $1.5T Stablecoin Market With New Reserve Fund for Issuers
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/11/13/bny-eyes-usd1-5t-stablecoin-market-with-new-reserve-fund-for-issuers
Time Published: 2025-11-13T15:08:14Z
Full Content:
BNY, one of the oldest banks in the U.S., is rolling out a new money market fund aimed at helping stablecoin issuers meet federal reserve requirements under U.S. regulations, the firm announced on Thursday. The BNY Dreyfus Stablecoin Reserves Fund (BSRXX) is designed to hold cash-equivalent reserves for stablecoins issued under the GENIUS Act, a federal law enacted earlier this year that created a legal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged digital currencies. The fund doesn’t hold any stablecoins itself but acts as a regulated vehicle for backing them. The move comes as stablecoins, a set of cryptocurrencies with prices tied to fiat money like the U.S. dollar, are rapidly growing as a means of payment, with regulations addressing this sector of the broader crypto market being put in place across the globe. The stablecoin market could reach to $1.5 trillion by the end of the decade from its current $300 billion market size, BNY projected. "Cash is the cornerstone of the digital asset ecosystem, enabling global capital markets to move toward an always-on, 24/7 environment," Stephanie Pierce, deputy head of BNY Investments, said in a statement. "Stablecoins are at the forefront of this profound transformation." With the fund, BNY aims to provide a key piece of infrastructure for stablecoin issuers to maintain the value of the tokens. Global asset manager BlackRock, for example, launched the Circle Reserve Fund, which manages $66 billion of U.S. Treasuries and repos serving as reserve for the USDC stablecoin. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered U.S. crypto bank, provided the fund’s initial investment. "This fund represents the infrastructure needed to make compliant stablecoin issuance possible at scale," said Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley in a statement. The fund is open to qualified institutional investors, including those acting in custodial, brokerage or fiduciary roles. BNY says the move is part of a broader push to support the growing overlap between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Is Retiring up 595%, but She’s Still Holding on to These 3 Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history. Since mid-2014, her strategy has yielded her 858.58% in gains, whereas the S&P 500 only returned 263.2%. This is a 595% outperformance over the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the three stocks she holds now. Nvidia is Pelosi’s biggest holding, with 20% of her portfolio being in this one stock. Her latest trade was on January 14, 2025, and was disclosed on January 17. She purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $80 and an expiration date of January 16, 2026. Since that trade, NVDA stock is up 47.09%. If the options were to be exercised today, she would have a total of $569,000 in NVDA stock. To find the true profits, you’d have to exclude the premium paid for all these options, the exact amount of which is not known. Alphabet is her second-biggest holding, with 15% of her portfolio in GOOGL stock. Her latest transaction was on January 14, 2025, and was filed three days later on January 17. She bought 50 call options on GOOGL stock, with each option representing 100 shares. This has been a very profitable buy, with GOOGL stock up more than 46% since that transaction took place. Since these are options, Pelosi will be able to exercise 5,000 shares of GOOGL at the strike price of $150. If these options were to be exercised today, she would have $683,550 in GOOGL stock. This is a well-timed trade, and Pelosi is very likely to exercise these options by the time they expire and then hold GOOGL stock directly. Broadcom also has the same weight as Alphabet at 15%. Her most recent AVGO trade happened on June 20, 2025, and it was disclosed on July 9. She exercised 20 call options that were purchased on June 24, 2024 (20,000 shares post-split). President Donald Trump announced a $70 billion investment in AI and energy, less than a month after Pelosi exercised those options. AVGO stock is up 42.09% since the call options were exercised, but her initial call options trade made even more money. Pelosi bought 20 call options on AVGO with an $800 strike price and an expiry of June 20, 2025. This was three weeks before AVGO went through a 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock gained over 50% from June 24, 2024, to June 20, 2025.

The initiative targets inefficiencies in the foreign exchange market, which still operates on fragmented venues, prefunded accounts, and T+1 settlement cycles. T+1 settlement means when you trade an asset, the actual transfer of money and ownership happens the next business day, not immediately. By combining Arc's programmable settlement infrastructure with stablecoin-powered trading, Circle seeks to enable real-time cross-border currency exchange with reduced counterparty risk and capital requirements. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” Circle Chief Product and Technology Officer Nikhil Chandhok said in the press release. The announcement follows Circle's strong third-quarter performance, with the company reporting $740 million in revenue and reserve income, surpassing analyst forecasts by 66% year over year. USDC’s market capitalization has risen from $61 billion at Circle’s June IPO to over $76 billion, according to CoinGecko, still trailing Tether’s USDT, which tops $184 billion. StableFX operates through a request-for-quote execution model connecting institutions with multiple liquidity providers, offering competitive pricing with low slippage. The platform features on-chain settlement, where both payment and delivery occur simultaneously, eliminating the risk that one party fails to deliver funds after receiving the counterparty's currency. The all-to-all model removes the need for bilateral agreements with multiple counterparties. Currently live on Arc testnet, StableFX is available for approved institutions that have completed Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering verification ahead of Arc's planned 2026 mainnet launch. Arc uses USDC for transaction fees, features sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy configurations designed for institutional compliance requirements. During the testnet launch, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has shown “remarkable early momentum,” with the firm noting in its Q3 report that it’s exploring the possibility of a native Arc token. Circle Partner Stablecoins targets non-USD-pegged stablecoin issuers meeting technical, operational, and reserve management standards. Initial participants include Avenia (Brazilian real), Forte (Australian dollar), JYPC (Japanese yen), Juno (Mexican peso), BDACS (South Korean won), Stablecorp (Canadian dollar), Luno (South African rand), and Coins.ph (Philippine peso). These stablecoins gain integration into Circle's Payments Network and StableFX, expanding utility beyond domestic markets.

Circle is seeking to improve FX market infrastructure by offering institutions deeper global liquidity access with fewer intermediaries and reduced counterparty risk. Circle is expanding into the foreign-exchange market, positioning stablecoins as a tool to modernize one of traditional finance’s most entrenched systems. The issuer of USDC (USDC) on Thursday unveiled Circle StableFX, an institutional onchain FX platform built on Arc1, the company’s forthcoming layer-1 blockchain, according to a news release shared with Cointelegraph. Circle also introduced Circle Partner Stablecoins, a program designed to support regulated regional stablecoins. Trading in the global FX market reached $9.6 trillion per day in April, up 28% from 2022, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The daily trading volume in the global FX market is more than double all global stock markets combined, and far exceeds the roughly $1.69 trillion in average daily US equities trading, running 24 hours a day, five days a week, across every major financial center, according to World Bank data shared by Trading Economics. The new FX engine aims to allow compliant institutions access to stablecoin currency pairs with 24/7 onchain settlement at competitive rates and lower counterparty risk. It also aims to enhance efficiency in FX markets by eliminating the need for multiple counterparties and facilitating faster access to global liquidity. “With StableFX and Circle Partner Stablecoins, we’re connecting the world’s currencies on Arc,” said Circle chief product and technology officer, Nikhil Chandhok. Institutions will need to complete comprehensive Know-Your-Business and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verification to use the “compliance-centric trading environment,” the release said. Circle StableFX has launched on the Arc Testnet, offering developers and institutions the opportunity to explore the solution. The alpha version is scheduled to roll out for approved developers and institutions alongside the Arc mainnet launch in 2026. Related: Crypto’s yield gap with TradFi narrows as staking, RWAs surge Circle’s move into FX marks a growing trend among major crypto companies seeking to reshape traditional markets and claim a share of their revenue. The move into the FX markets may bring a significant new revenue stream for the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin. Circle’s revenue surged to $740 million in the third quarter of the year, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. The stablecoin issuer launched its Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies.

Title: This is how MAGA falls

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2025 5:30:32 AM PST by lasereye As in his first term, Donald Trump now presides over a visibly sinking ship as his approval ratings slide. MAGA, a movement built around the personality of one man, never amounted to a coherent political force or even a workable coalition. Claims that Trump and his lieutenants won a mandate in 2024 and then ‘saved’ the country were always delusional. After all, his margin was thin, as was that of his party in Congress. Three forces are killing MAGA, perhaps even pushing the US in a distinctly socialist direction. The first are the internal divisions, which are growing ever-more pronounced and will only intensify as an aging Trump becomes an ever-lamer duck, particularly if Democrats romp to victory again in the 2026 midterms. The second, arguably more serious, weakness lies in the loss of the Latino vote – a growing political force in many states. Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President.

Many Latinos shifted to Trump in 2024, but the brutality of the ICE crackdown, reported with typical zeal by his media foes, has eroded his appeal, as seen in results from New York, New Jersey and Virginia. The third, and most fatal, factor is the economy, whose troubles may have begun under Biden but now belong to Trump. Pressured by investors and accelerated by the rise of artificial intelligence, the US has produced an economy in which major companies, particularly in tech, are shedding workers even as they post record profits. It’s not a good look, especially given that under Trump the 10 richest Americans grew richer by an astounding $700 billion. The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The ideological divide within MAGA has grown increasingly harsh. Trump is not, at heart, a professional politician. Rather, he is a blend of New York developer and carnival barker. His uneasy alliance with ‘tech bros’, Wall Street insiders and fervent right-wing nativists was never stable. It was held together mostly by Trump himself – and by the awfulness of the Democrats. Even as he strikes a populist pose, some people influential in MAGA flirt with ideas like eugenic Darwinism and a permanent ruling aristocracy. Others within MAGA embrace isolationism and attacks on minorities, particularly Jews. Trump rejects such notions, but too many top GOP figures, argues Senator Ted Cruz, seem terrified of alienating the odious Tucker Carlson to do so. At its worst, MAGA’s hardest faction embraces openly racist groups such as the Proud Boys. There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively.

Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

There’s also a class element at play. Carlson, himself a product of the upper class, claims to speak for what he sees as ‘core’ Americans – basically middle-class white people – some of whom view immigration and cultural change as existential threats. Sadly, this faction could define MAGA after Trump. Its likely vehicle is Trump’s heir apparent, JD Vance. I spent time with the vice-president before his Trumpist conversion and he once seemed genuinely sensitive to the struggles of the poor, having come from that world himself. Now he seems unwilling to denounce far-right anti-Semites and, despite being married to a Hindu, appears intent on morphing MAGA into a white Christian nationalist movement. As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As a political strategy, this approach has limited prospects, given the demographic decline of the white population. Until recently, MAGA gained ground among growing groups – especially Asians and Latinos. Latinos, in particular, represent a vast and expanding electoral force. Since 1970, they’ve risen from five per cent to roughly 20 per cent of the US population. Between 2010 and 2023, they accounted for 56.3 per cent of total population growth. The Census Bureau projects they’ll expand by another 31 million between 2025 and 2060. In 2024, Trump won an unprecedented share for a Republican of this critical bloc. Many Latinos favoured his early measures to secure the border and expel criminal aliens. But the crackdown on long-settled workers – people who’ve raised families and bought homes – has deeply unsettled even right-leaning Latinos. Few people are unmoved by the sight of families being herded into vans and sent away. MAGA activists may not realise it, but Latinos are not a marginal community separated from mainstream America. The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The vast majority speak English – even in multicultural Los Angeles, barely one in five Hispanics from non-immigrant households speaks Spanish at home, while three-fifths of third-generation Latinos speak only English. A third, and likely most critical, challenge lies in long-term economic shifts. The rise of tech oligopolies has ushered in a neo-feudalist future. Libertarian ideologues and their tech backers hail AI as the dawn of a new golden age, yet they seem blind to what’s happening on the ground. This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This is reflected in California, home to both the richest people in the world and the nation’s highest concentration of poverty. Under Trump’s first administration, working-class wages – a critical concern for Latinos – rose significantly. Today, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is widening again. High-profile extravagance by the oligarchic elite, from Jeff Bezos’s $50 million wedding to the endless parade of nine-figure Manhattan apartments, does little to inspire faith in unrestrained capitalism. Even the highly educated, burdened by debt and schooled in left-leaning academia, see their career prospects shrinking. Despite soaring tech profits, AI tools have fuelled layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft. Among recent college graduates, computer-science majors now face among the highest unemployment rates, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Even in San Francisco – the supposed epicentre of the AI boom – city economist Ted Egan notes that new startups have not offset layoffs at big tech firms. The spoils of AI will likely flow to investors, a few entrepreneurs and well-compensated ‘genius’ programmers, leaving little opportunities for the middle- and working-class Californians. Meanwhile, young urbanites face crushing costs for food and housing. New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

If that continues, 2026 and 2028 will not be good. I believe those large deals Trump has made to bring manufacturing back will start bearing fruit during the term of the next President.

New Yorkers pay the nation’s highest share of income for housing and have by far the lowest homeownership rate – half the national average. Job growth skews to the low end of the pay scale; since 2020, New York has lost 76,000 middle-income jobs, while low-income positions have surged. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayoral race reflects these pressures, mobilising educated professionals – including some earning over $200,000 a year. His brand of socialism may not spread far beyond the Hudson, but even more moderate Democrats, California’s Gavin Newsom and the ‘Abundance’ movement among them, see cost-of-living issues as a ticket to national power.Whether their solutions are credible may not matter. History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media.

History shows that economic pain drives voters to extremes and fuels collectivist sentiment, whether on the left or the right. In today’s climate, even traditional liberals face purges. New York’s left is preparing to challenge and push out figures like Representative Richie Torres for deviations from party orthodoxy, in this case over Israel. Even Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, seems destined to be forced out – perhaps replaced by the left’s ‘it girl’, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC). Some on the right hope the far left will so tarnish the Democratic brand that voters will continue to swallow MAGA rule into the next decade. Certainly, the youth-driven push to limit incomes and wealth could keep some corporate types clinging to MAGA. And the rise of figures like AOC – now the House’s top fundraiser – may frighten business donors, but could also force moderate Democrats to refocus, as Mamdani did, on economic rather than cultural issues. But unless Democrats start quoting Lenin and Mao, it’s hard to see the already fractured MAGA coalition addressing these challenges effectively. Trump’s corporate allies already chafe at limits on H-1B visas or at policies confronting China, from which many profit. Nor is Trump likely to antagonise Wall Street further by curbing large firms’ ability to buy up single-family homes. Worse for MAGA, many of Trump’s signature initiatives – on trade, defence and border security – won’t deliver visible benefits before the 2026 or 2028 elections. The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

The promise of new factories and high-tech investment could yield blue-collar jobs eventually, as Nvidia’s Jensen Huang predicts, but not soon enough to matter.Even the most deluded Trump loyalists should recognise that progressives still command most of the nation’s cultural and informational institutions – especially education and media. As AI systems draw primarily on left-leaning sources, this influence will deepen. Universities, NGOs and tech firms may temporarily appease Trump, but once MAGA weakens, they’ll unleash their vast resources against it. In the end, MAGA is likely to lose out, even though Trump’s policies may shape the nation’s direction for years, a bit like an unpleasant but necessary enema. Unless the GOP rediscovers its Reaganite optimism and turns from vengeance to economic renewal, America’s future will likely belong either to the radical socialists or to the oligarch-friendly technocrats. Neither of which would be a desirable outcome.

A 28-year old man has been charged in connection with the seizure of €620,000 worth of cannabis at Shannon airport yesterday. Sean Grehan, of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin, appeared before Gort District Court this morning. Garda Kevin Molloy told the court he arrested Mr Grehan at 6.10pm yesterday and at 6.20pm charged him with two drugs offences. He said Mr Grehan made no reply. Solicitor Olivia Lynch told Judge Alec Gabbett that there would be no application for bail today but a bail application would be made on behalf of Mr Grehan on his next appearance in court. Mr Grehan is charged with having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 at Shannon airport on 12 November. Mr Grehan is also charged with having in his possession cannabis contrary to Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Ms Lynch asked for a short remand in custody to allow the application for bail to be made at Mr Grehan's next court appearance. Judge Gabbett said that he could hear the bail application at Ennis District Court tomorrow. Ms Lynch said that she has been in contact with Mr Grehan’s solicitor, Patricia Camilon at KOD Lyons in Dublin, who will make the bail application on Mr Grehan’s behalf at the next court. She asked that she be granted legal aid for today's court appearance after Mr Grehan confirmed to the court that he does not work. Judge Gabbett granted legal aid. Judge Gabbett said that he would remand Mr Grehan in custody to Castlerea prison to appear at Ennis District Court for DPP directions and a bail application. Judge Gabbett asked are there any issues relating to Mr Grehan that prison authorities should know about such as any medical attention required and Ms Lynch replied "no, he is all good". © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Sen. John Kennedy didn't 'execute' AOC, Schumer and other Democratic leaders on C-SPAN
URL: https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/schumer-aoc-john-kennedy/
Time Published: 2025-11-13T12:00:00Z

About this rating A rumor that circulated online in November 2025 claimed a live C-SPAN broadcast showed U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., scolding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic Party leadership over their "Green New Deal 2.0" costing $93 trillion. On Nov. 10, a Facebook user named Kienen-Patricia-Natasja shared the claim with a collage of photos of Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez and Kennedy. The post was headlined "KENNEDY JUST EXECUTED AOC, SCHUMER & THE ENTIRE DEM LEADERSHIP ON LIVE C-SPAN – CHAMBER WENT FUNERAL-QUIET IN 38 SECONDS." Other users shared this same story word-for-word on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn (archived), Truth Social and X (archived), as well as at least two blogs. (Kienen-Patricia-Natasja/Facebook) The post began as follows: KENNEDY JUST EXECUTED AOC, SCHUMER & THE ENTIRE DEM LEADERSHIP ON LIVE C-SPAN – CHAMBER WENT FUNERAL-QUIET IN 38 SECONDS Senate Floor. AOC was mid-sentence, waving her printed Green New Deal 2.0 like a victory flag. "Senator Kennedy refuses to support our $93 trillion climate justice plan because he's a dinosaur who—" Kennedy stood up, slow, holding a plain manila folder labeled "DEM RECEIPTS – DO NOT BEND." He didn't wait for the chair to recognize him. He just started reading, voice like molasses over broken glass: "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Net worth jump 2020-2025: $29,000 → $12.4 million Campaign promise: 'No corporate PAC money' Actual donors: BlackRock, Google, Pfizer – $4.7 million in dark money funneled through ActBlue shells Bartender story: last W-2 showed $26k – while mommy's seven rental properties paid the real bills Green New Deal co-author: Saikat Chakrabarti – fired for funneling $1.2 million to his own LLC" He flipped the page. "Chuck Schumer 'Working class hero' from Brooklyn Current residence: $8.2 million Park Slope brownstone Wife's net worth: $47 million from Goldman Sachs board seat The rest of the post claimed the alleged C-SPAN video received "28 million concurrent viewers," and that "#KennedyMassplode trended #1 worldwide for 36 straight hours." In short, the rumor was false. No such C-SPAN video exists. Kennedy made no such remarks, nor did Ocasio-Cortez — a House member — speak on the Senate floor. The story featured fabricated details about Ocasio-Cortez, as well as Schumer and his wife, Iris Weinshall, all likely written with the help of artificial-intelligence tools. A scan of the text with AI-detection tools (which are not always reliable) produced differing results, with Copyleaks concluding a 100% likelihood of AI-generated content and ZeroGPT displaying a 1.88% match. As of Nov. 10, the Kienen-Patricia-Natasja Facebook page's "page transparency" tab listed at least two of its managers as residing in Vietnam. By Nov. 11, that number changed to one page manager in Vietnam. Snopes previously reported many stories about Vietnam-run Facebook pages promoting fabricated, AI-generated stories about celebrities, politics and disasters. Other Facebook pages also featured the same false story alongside comments featuring links to advertisement-filled blog articles. Those Facebook pages showed page managers residing in Vietnam. We contacted the Kienen-Patricia-Natasja Facebook page via Messenger to ask its owners about their fabricated content — featuring many other completely fictional stories with writing resembling AI-generated content, as well as AI-generated images of Kennedy — and will update this story if we receive more information. The fabricated story contained several false or entirely unsubstantiated claims about Ocasio-Cortez and Schumer. Regarding the $12.4 million net-worth claim, we previously reported on the false rumor that Ocasio-Cortez became a multimillionaire after being elected to Congress. Searches of Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo located no information about Ocasio-Cortez receiving $4.7 million in "dark money" campaign contributions, nor did searches find details to confirm her mother owned seven rental properties. One part of the post said Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's former chief of staff, was "fired for funneling $1.2 million to his own LLC." A search for Chakrabarti's name found Politico reporting in early August 2019 that he had resigned. A New York Post article also featured some details of an investigation involving Chakrabarti allegedly funneling more than $1 million to two LLCs. In January 2022, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a case involving Chakrabarti after voting 3-3, indicating a failure to find reason to believe he violated a federal election law regarding dollar limits on contributions. As for Schumer and the claim about an $8.2 million apartment, The New York Times reported he purchased his Park Slope apartment in Brooklyn — not a brownstone — in 1983. Observer.com reported the purchase occurred in 1982, at a cost of $157,000. Regarding Iris Weinshall, Schumer's wife, The New York Public Library's website listed her as its chief operating officer and treasurer. A Google search for "has Iris Weinshall worked for Goldman Sachs" displays a result making it appear as if she truly once worked for the bank and investment company, as the fabricated story claimed. That search result description text read, "Earlier in her career, she worked for Goldman Sachs in the Investment Banking Division." However, that sentence applied to a different person's biography on the library website, not Weinshall's. This mention of Goldman Sachs appeared in a different person's biography. For further reading, we previously investigated other untrue claims about Ocasio-Cortez, including one alleging her brother was arrested after police found him in possession of $1.2 million worth of fentanyl.

ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. The greenies are on the run. So how is it that the low-carbon portfolio run by Xavier Chollet is just now doing so well? Chollet oversees the Clean Energy Transition strategy for Pictet, one of the larger Swiss money managers. It’s a tough assignment. Over the past decade, alternative-energy stocks have fallen well behind the S&P 500 index. But this year they turned a corner. So far this year Chollet’s $5.5 billion collection of stocks is up 26%, 9 points ahead of the S&P 500. There are two elements to the Pictet portfolio’s survival. One is that Chollet is permitted to define “transition” in a very expansive fashion. He has only 24% of the money in renewables like solar and wind. The rest tracks other themes, like energy efficiency in semiconductors, energy efficiency in buildings and products that make industrial processes either more efficient or cleaner. The other safety valve is that Chollet shuns the most speculative ventures of the green-energy genre. He says, “We want to invest in companies that are profitable and don’t need subsidies.” That rules out a lot of obvious candidates for a carbon-shunning fund. Green-hydrogen companies, for example, have a way of losing money even when collecting government handouts. He won’t touch them. So it was that during the insane run-up in solar and hydrogen stocks during 2020, Chollet lagged other alternative-energy managers. The next year solar and hydrogen crashed, but the Pictet fund was up. Over the long term, his looser notion of investing in an energy transition, and his favoritism toward somewhat conservative stocks, has given him staying power. Chollet, 51, grew up in Geneva and joined the Pictet home office there immediately after getting business degrees from the University of Lausanne and the University of Miami. He has been on the clean-energy strategy since 2011. Most of his clients are institutional or individual investors in Europe; recently, for the U.S. market, his employer opened the Pictet Cleaner Planet ETF. Chollet’s team is responsible for half the stock picks now in the U.S. fund. Chollet speaks with a French accent but his portfolio has an American slant, with 74% of assets in U.S. companies. His biggest bet, with not quite 5% of assets, is on Nextracker, which makes equipment to aim solar arrays at the sun. It’s in the black. Its share price has more than doubled this year. This, even though 2025 would seem to be a bad year to bet on solar. To the horror of environmentalists, Bill Gates, just four years after penning a book on the climate catastrophe, is now opining that the money spent fighting carbon might better be spent fighting poverty and disease. And then there are the politicians spouting the slogan “Drill, baby, drill.” With a fossil-fuel lover in the White House, how can renewable energy be doing so well now? Because investors, anticipating the worst, were pleasantly surprised this year. That allegedly beautiful tax bill that President Trump pushed through didn’t kill alternative-energy subsidies. It mostly threw on some deadlines and some buy-American provisions. Says Chollet: “The rules of the game for the current administration in solar in the U.S. are way better than everyone expected.” What would happen in a world without rules—with, that is, neither mandates nor subsidies? Wouldn’t solar and wind be dead? Not at all, says Chollet: “Close to 90% of the new power additions in the world come from renewable and storage, not from nuclear or gas or coal, because it makes economic sense.” He pulls out a chart of electricity generation costs in the U.S. With fuel and capital costs combined, a kilowatt-hour of onshore wind costs 5 cents, solar 6 cents, natural gas 10 cents. He concedes that the numbers for the two renewables would be higher if you included the cost of batteries to supply juice during doldrums and darkness. But even with batteries attached, he says, renewables are cheaper than fossil-fuel or nuclear power generation. The costs he cites, importantly, are before any benefit from government subsidies. Put costs aside for a moment, Chollet goes on. Think about availability. Artificial intelligence research by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet will draw lots of power, sometimes a gigawatt or more per installation. (A gigawatt would power a large city.) Those AI fanatics want their energy now, not later. The delivery time for a solar plant in the U.S. is a year, Chollet says, for an onshore wind farm two years. A gas-powered plant needs turbines for which the wait, including installation time, is four years. What about nuclear? Even if cookie-cutter plants (“small modular reactors”) catch on, it will take a utility ten years for the permits and the construction, he says. Trump doesn’t like renewables and he doesn’t like solar panels that come from China. But he also doesn’t want China getting ahead in AI, Chollet says. So Trump won’t get in the way of the solar that will power data centers. Chollet has stakes in solar companies (like Nextracker) that supply utility-scale projects. He avoids companies (like Sunrun) doing residential solar. Better still, Chollet’s definition of what is meant by “clean energy” allows him to get another piece of the hot data center business. So far Nvidia has been the conspicuous beneficiary of AI spending, but Chollet sees the arc of technology bending toward two other semiconductor companies. He has stakes in Broadcom and Marvell Technology, which make “application specific integrated circuits.” ASICs, while less flexible than Nvidia’s graphics processing units, are less gluttonous with electricity consumption. Chollet is in semiconductors for the growth; he’s allowed to be in them on the theory that specialized chips will do less damage to the planet than the usual kind. High-growth stocks tend to be both expensive and risky. Broadcom trades at 93 times trailing earnings. In Chollet’s eyes its growth makes it affordable at 29 times the earnings he expects two years from now. As for risk, that is dampened by the boring stocks in the Pictet lineup, such as Xcel Energy, a midwestern utility; Linde, which sells gases to make industrial processes more efficient, and TopBuild, which sells garage doors and asphalt shingles. Wait. What’s green about garage doors? TopBuild also sells insulation. By reducing heating and cooling loads, insulation preserves the planet. Technology is uncertain. The hot and cold of carbon politics is uncertain. But there is something to be said for accepting risk while moderating it. In 2020 the iShares Clean Energy ETF delivered a 141% return, Morningstar reports, leaving Chollet’s stocks far behind with only 54%. But in 2021 the iShares fund lost money while Chollet’s portfolio gained 12%. Over the past decade (through September) iShares has delivered a 7% annual return in clean energy, Pictet 12%. For Chollet, adopting a light shade of green has been a good strategy.

Title: Don't Chase Google, Meta: IBM Chief Scientist Urges Graduates To Examine Sectors Outside Silicon Valley
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/dont-chase-google-meta-ibm-chief-scientist-urges-graduates-to-examine-sectors-outside-silicon-valley
Time Published: 2025-11-13T11:18:19Z
Full Content:
IBM Chief Scientist Ruchir Puri urged tech graduates to explore avenues beyond chasing after the prestige of Silicon Valley tech giants such as Google, Meta or Microsoft. He encouraged them to instead look into those sectors and industries where they find potential for innovation, in light of the turbulence in the job market primarily stemming from AI. "Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after," Puri said, indicating that software engineers have niches they can thrive in beyond large tech companies. "Artificial intelligence is transforming every sector — from agriculture to retail — and meaningful work is happening everywhere," he said in an interview with Business Today. Puri used the example of agricultural manufacturing company John Deere which have used AI and automation to optimise its operations in innovative ways. The firm has pioneered ecofriendly and economical ways to engage in weeding, such as the 'spot and spray' method, where cameras and AI are used to find and target individual weeds, helping farmer cut costs and reduce damage to crops. “Graduates often overlook such enterprises while focusing narrowly on Silicon Valley,” Puri said. He asked freshers to see beyond "a narrow set of tech companies" and to look to the "massive enterprise landscape". His comments can also be contextualised with the increasing number of lay-offs and lower job demand in tech companies with the advent of AI automation. Job postings reduced 16% year-over-year, according to an August report from Handshake, at the same time, applications per posting went up 26% showing the gap between demand and supply. Tech conglomerates such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Amazon have announced waves of layoffs in 2025. IBM also stated earlier in the month that it would get rid of thousands of positions across the globe in the fourth quarter. However the firm also said that its planning to ramp up hiring young graduates for AI-centred positions, according statements chief executive officer Arvidn Krishna made to CNN in an interview. “People are talking about layoffs or hiring freezes, but I actually want to say we are the opposite,” Krishna said. “We expect to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in recent years," he added.

Title: Former BBC exec Marc Allen launches BlackRock-backed TV, film royalty acquisition platform Easttree Media

Former BBC executive Marc Allen has joined forces with private equity veterans Chris Helm and Markku Lonnqvist to launch a BlackRock-backed investment platform for acquiring income rights to TV and film content. Marc Allen Income rights in film and TV are payments made to creators for the ongoing use of their work after its initial release, primarily through royalties and residuals. Based in the UK, Easttree Media is looking to acquire these rights from prodcos, studios, financiers and other rights holders, mirroring a trend already seen in the music industry in recent years. Founded last year, Easttree is backed by funds and accounts managed by US asset management giant BlackRock, which partnered with Warner Music Group in 2022 to buy up stakes in music copyrights. Royalty acquisition platform Easttree claims to have already completed multiple transactions involving TV shows, “establishing itself as a proven partner for rights holders seeking to unlock value.” Allen brings experience from the entertainment space as a former production executive for the BBC, MD of Leeds-based True North Productions and chief operating officer of London-headquartered management and production company 42. Helm previously served as chief financial officer of Hipgnosis Songs Funds, overseeing acquisitions of music catalogues. Lonnqvist, meanwhile, most recently served as chief investment officer at Hipgnosis Song Management and was previously a partner at Pamplona Capital Management. Allen said: “Being able to provide such a service for such a broad range of talent, as well as sophisticated, high-value solutions for the world’s largest film and TV entertainment industry players, gives us a unique opportunity to work with creators, producers and platforms across the whole film and TV spectrum regardless of scale.” Helm added: “Our vision is to approach film and TV participations through a fresh lens – bringing transparency, alignment and partnerships that serve talent. “We’re firm believers that acquirers of music rights can scale, succeed commercially and still advocate for artists. We are bringing that same conviction to film and television, turning these income rights into a transformative new asset class.” Paul Braude, head of the Direct Private Opportunities group at BlackRock, said: “Iconic film and television titles continue to attract audiences well beyond their initial release, and we believe these assets provide our clients with even greater choice to meet their investment needs alongside access to distinctive and durable source of returns.”

Title: Have We Entered a New Feudal Era?

Time Published: 2025-11-13T06:58:35Z
Full Content:
Investiture of a knight (miniature from the statutes of the Order of the Knot, founded in 1352 by Louis I of Naples) – Public Domain Ever since the Internet was born, along with Big Tech, in the 1990s, the world has had a sense that we have entered a new era in global political economy. Many have tried to place a finger on what this transformation is all about. Perhaps the most famous among these critical thinkers is Shoshana Zuboff, who wrote that we are living in an era of “surveillance capitalism,” wherein our harvesting information from cyberspace also provides Google, Microsoft, and other tech titans the opportunity to rake in data about us that they process to create our digital profiles. These profiles are then used by them or their client corporations to manipulate us into purchasing products or are sold to the state, which has an interest in keeping tabs on us. Another important effort to define what was new came from Mckenzie Wark, who wrote in her influential Hacker’s Manifesto that the central contradiction of the new age was no longer that between capital and labor but between “hackers,” or the sources of innovation and creativity who wanted to keep information free, and the “vectoral ruling class” that sought to expropriate knowledge and turn it into a commodity. Acknowledging his debt to both Zuboff and Wark, Yanis Varoufakis says that while they have important insights, they have not followed these to their logical conclusion: that capitalism as a distinct mode of production has been superseded. The synthesis that Varoufakis offers is what he calls “technofeudalism.” He does not say that capitalists no longer matter. They do, and they still engage in extracting surplus value or profit from workers in the process of production. But they themselves are subordinate to a new elite, the “cloud capitalists” or “cloudalists,” who have privatized the commons that was cyberspace and now control access to it. The cloudalists, among the most powerful of which are Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and the chipmaker Nvidia, control the globe-spanning information highways that are sustained materially by massive data centers located in different parts of the world. Accessing these intermeshed networks in cyberspace known as the “cloud” is now vital for the traditional or “terrestrial” capitalists to get access to you to sell their products, and these corporate gatekeepers make their money by charging these capitalists rent. Without access to the net, capitalists cannot make profits, and, very much like the feudal lords of yore who controlled land, the cloudalists’ monopolistic control of the cloud allows them to directly or indirectly collect, from the “vassal capitalists” and anyone who uses the net, “rent,” or income that is not subject to the market competition on which profit depends. Cloud Proles and Cloud Serfs As in capitalism, it is not the cloudalists or the terrestrial capitalists that produce value. The real sources of value are what Varoufakis calls the “cloud proles” and the “cloud serfs.” The cloud proles are the service workers at Amazon and other Big Tech facilities who are nonunionized, paid meager wages, and in constant threat of being displaced by robots and Artificial Intelligence. But these proles’ labor provides only a fraction of the value extracted by the cloudalists. It is the cloud serfs that create most of that value. Following Zuboff, Varoufakis says the cloud serfs are most of us: we provide raw material for the cloud whenever we do a Google search, post a photo on Facebook, or order a book on Amazon, material that is then processed into information that the cloudalists and terrestrial capitalists can use to develop ever more sophisticated marketing strategies to get us to part with our dollars. The distinguishing characteristic of cloud serfs is they are doing unpaid work for the cloudalists even if they don’t realize it. As he remarks, “The fact that we do so voluntarily, happily even, does not detract from the fact that we are unpaid manufacturers—cloud serfs whose daily self-directed toil enriches a tiny band of multibillionaires.” We are, in other words, the unsuspecting marks of the ultimate scam. The Rise of Cloud Capital Varoufakis traces the rise of the cloudalists to the central banks’ creation of money with zero or below zero interest in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008 and, later, during the COVID 19 pandemic, to stimulate production and consumer spending. But, with the big fall in demand, most corporations did not invest the loans the private banks channeled to them, instead using them to buy back their own corporate stocks at low prices or invest it in real estate. But cloudalists like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg used the central bank money rerouted to them by the big banks to massively invest in expanding and monopolizing the cloud. The cloudalists mopped up many of the billions sloshing around within the financial system. With them, they paid for server farms, fibre optic cables, artificial intelligence laboratories, gargantuan warehouses, software developers, top-notch engineers, laboratories, promising start-ups and all the rest. In an environment where profit had become optional, the cloudalists seized upon the central bank money to build a new empire. Resistance in the Era of Technofeudalism The central contradiction in the technofeudal era has passed from the conflict between labor and capital to that between the cloudalists and their cloud serfs and cloud proles. Varoufakis is my colleague in the international council of Progressive International (PI), and he has helped inspire PI’s partnership with the Switzerland-based UNI Global Union to organize annual one-day strikes by Amazon workers in many countries. According to him, if these actions could be coordinated with Amazon users, so that a critical mass of them are convinced not to visit the Amazon website for even one day, the impact would not be minimal: “Even if were only mildly successful, causing say a 10 percent drop in Amazon’s usual revenues, while Amazon’s warehouse strike disrupted deliveries for 24 hours, such action might prove enough to push Amazon’s share price down in ways that no traditional labor action could achieve.” But building a strong resistance movement to the cloudalists will have to go beyond such momentary alliances. “To stand any chance of overthrowing technofeudalism and putting the demos back into democracy,” he writes, “we need to gather together not just the traditional proletariat and the crowd proles but also the cloud serfs and, indeed, some of the vassal capitalists.” Varoufakis might have added to this “grand coalition” the communities whose lives have been disrupted by Big Data. As a recent New York Times article reports, As data centers rise, the sites — which need vast amounts of power for computing and water to cool the computers — have contributed to or exacerbated disruptions not only in Mexico, but in more than a dozen other countries…In Ireland, data centers consume more than 20 percent of the country’s electricity. In Chile, precious aquifers are in danger of depletion. In South Africa, where blackouts have long been routine, data centers are further taxing the national grid. Similar concerns have surfaced in Brazil, Britain, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore and Spain. Communities forced to host data centers, in fact, are now the cutting edge of resistance to Big Tech. In country after country, notes the report, “activists, residents and environmental organizations have banded together to oppose data centers. Some have tried blocking the projects, while others have pushed for more oversight and transparency.” Clarification Needed I have a few comments on some of the key elements of Varoufakis’ paradigm, and these are advanced in a critical but friendly spirit: First, his conceptualization of the proles appears to include only the low-paid service workers. What about the information engineers and other knowledge specialists and their office staffs? He talks about the role of the “technostructure” in late capitalism in the early part of the book, but it seems he includes the different layers of this stratum in management during the technofeudal era rather than in labor, though as Mckenzie Wark stressed, technical innovators or “hackers” contribute to the value that is expropriated by the Big Tech elite. Second, there is some ambiguity in the book when it comes to who exactly has the ultimate power in the technofeudal power structure. In most of the book, the billionaire leaders of the Big Tech firms like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook, are portrayed as the power elite. But he also writes about the “financial uber-lords [who] rival the cloudalists—three U.S. companies with powers exceeding those of private equity and all terrestrial capitalists put together: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These three firms, the Big Three as they are known in financial circles, effectively own American capitalism.” This is due to the controlling shares they own in the most strategic corporations. So, do we have a split power elite with blocs that have different sources of power? Are we really in a post-capitalist era or merely in another (higher? hyper?) stage of capitalism? This relates to my third point, which is that Varoufakis must do more explaining of how the dynamics of technofeudalism are really distinct from those of monopoly capitalism. Economists, both progressive and orthodox, have long contended that in a situation of monopoly or oligopoly, as in the car industry or pharmaceuticals, the key players derive profit but they also extract rent, which is profit in excess of what would be available if there were significant market competition. As in the car and drug industries, there is in the Big Tech sector both oligopoly and fierce competition, much of it “non-price competition,” the dynamics of which results in both profit and rent. Are not the dynamics of cloudalist competition really the same? How does monopoly capitalist rent differ from technofeudal rent? How do the earnings of Google, for instance, differ from those of non-Big Tech oligopolists like JP Morgan, Johnson and Johnson, and Toyota, except perhaps in terms of volume? My last point has to do with the changing relationship between the state and the cloudalists. In the book, the state mainly appears as an enabler of the rise of the cloudalists via the central banks’ provision of free money in the aftermath of the Great Recession and during the pandemic. Recent developments, however, have seen the state disciplining Big Tech and curbing its freedom of maneuver. Under both the first Trump administration and Biden’s presidency, Washington imposed fairly restrictive measures that cut into the profits of the cloudalists, like the sharing of advanced information technology with Chinese corporations. For instance, export controls on advanced AI chips imposed by Biden in 2022 have drastically reduced Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI chip market from 95 percent to 50 percent, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. Under the second Trump administration, Washington has moved even more drastically, using the imposition of tariffs to force cloudalists like Apple to move key parts of their global supply chains to the United States, though this would involve major costs and disruptions. But acknowledging the state’s commanding role, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated recently, “The president wants more [production] in the US…Apple also wants more in the US.” On Accurately Naming the Beast Varoufakis does note the more prominent role of the state represented by these latest developments. However, he does not fully draw out their implications for what he has portrayed as the immense power of the cloudalists and what lies ahead for them. From the enabler of the cloudalists portrayed in Technofeudalism, the relationship between the state and Big Tech in the United States is becoming more like that between the Chinese Communist Party regime and China’s data titans like Alibaba and Baidu, as the geopolitical rivalry heats up and national security concerns, not profitability, take center stage. China’s political economy has been called state capitalism or political capitalism (with only the Communist Party of China clinging on to Deng Xiaoping’s definition of it as “socialism with Chinese characteristics”). Varoufakis contends that the choice of a name is critical to understanding the essence of a political economy. I agree. But to underline what is likely to be become an even bigger directive role for the state in the political economy of the United States and the increasing subordination of profitability to national security, I think we need a better word than “technofeudalism.” (This would have the added benefit of avoiding the subliminal association of the title to Friedrich Hayek’s classic anti-socialist neoliberal tract, The Road to Serfdom.) Technofeudalism is a provocative piece of analysis, well-argued and well-written. And it is very accessible to those with little background in political economy or economics. There may be areas where I may not completely agree or points that I feel should be more carefully elaborated, but these should not detract from my judgment that this book by one of today’s leading progressive thinkers is a major contribution to understanding the times we live in. Walden Bello, a columnist for Foreign Policy in Focus, is the author or co-author of 19 books, the latest of which are Capitalism’s Last Stand? (London: Zed, 2013) and State of Fragmentation: the Philippines in Transition (Quezon City: Focus on the Global South and FES, 2014).

Title: Alan Connolly ‘itching to get back’ to action with Cork as new era beckons

They’ve got a fresh vacancy for an iconic forward in Cork. Brian Hayes, one the county’s latest All Stars, may yet fill the void left by Patrick Horgan. Or perhaps it’ll be Alan Connolly. Few players, in Cork or beyond, possess the same potential to excite as the 24-year-old Blackrock clubman. In five seasons as a Cork senior hurler, Connolly has scored 24 goals in 41 league and championship games, a neat dozen goals in each competition. There are four competitive hat-tricks in there too, the latest registered against Dublin in this year’s All-Ireland semi-final, in addition to three games in which he netted twice. That’s Hoggy-esque scoring. Though rewind a couple of years and Connolly wasn’t so sure he’d even get a proper run at it. Shoulder surgery and then hamstring trouble cost him the entire 2023 season and when he eventually returned in March 2024, he spoke of the ‘dark place’ from which he’d just emerged. “I probably haven’t been fit for the past three years,” he acknowledged at the time. He started all 15 of Cork’s championship games since then across 2024 and 2025, winning a Munster medal this season and lining out in two All-Ireland finals. The journey will continue when preseason training resumes shortly under new manager Ben O’Connor. “I can’t wait to get back,” said Connolly at an event to promote Blackrock’s car raffle fundraiser. “It’s relentless obviously, but I’ve had about four to six weeks off now since the Midleton game in the semi-finals of the club so I’m itching to get back.” The Cork players weren’t agitating to get rid of former manager Pat Ryan, far from it, but recognise too that O’Connor is a safe pair of hands. “We would have been happy for Pat to stay on but to have someone of Ben’s calibre coming in is probably the next best thing,” said Connolly. “So I know we will be fine with Ben. I think a lot of the younger lads played under him on Cork under-20 teams. I didn’t, but I have only heard positive things about him.” Horgan’s departure has also created an opportunity for a new free-taker to emerge. Declan Dalton shared the duties this year though Connolly is also an option. “I take them with Blackrock, I’m comfortable taking them,” he said. “If I have to take them, I’ll take them, but that’s something we’ll think about in a few months’ time.” If Connolly really does aspire to step into Horgan’s shoes, he will need to chase vital consistency. The 3-1 he scored against Tipperary in the Munster Championship last year was followed by two scoreless games in which he was substituted. And, by Connolly’s standards, his performances in the 2024 and 2025 All-Ireland finals failed to hit the highs of which he is capable. But it’s all part of the learning curve for a player who wasn’t always sure his senior career would pan out. “Yeah, of course,” he agreed. “It was obviously tough because I got surgery on my shoulder and then when I came back, I did a grade-four tear on my hamstring.” There was also an ankle issue which took a chunk out of his 2025 league campaign. “I had a kind of bursitis, or tendinitis, in my ankle,” he said. “It kind of flared up. It just needed a few weeks off.” The road to iconic status is rarely straightforward. Just ask Horgan, who was dropped in 2022, the same season Connolly made his full championship debut. Horgan never got his All-Ireland medal in the end, but Connolly has time on his side and has already started processing the lessons from this year’s final defeat to Tipperary. “I’ve watched it back personally, yeah,” he said of the decider, where Cork let a six-point half-time lead end in a 15-point defeat. “It’s a hard watch all right, but it has to be done.” He doesn’t agree that Tipp outfoxed them by deploying a sweeper, stifling an attack that had struck 7-26 against Dublin in the semi-final. “We kind of had an idea they would play with a sweeper,” said Connolly. “I don’t think it was tactically that they won, it was more that they wanted it more. They were relentless in their tackling, they just went after us.” *Alan Connolly was speaking to promote Blackrock Hurling Club’s car raffle fundraiser in association with Cogans Toyota.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the NoTricksZone By P Gosselin By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt (in latest newsletter) Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, image: X. Cooling trend continues The global temperature did not change in October compared to August. The cooling trend remains intact. The American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) foresees a cool LA NINA developing in the Pacific this winter, which will lead to a further decline in global temperatures as well. Belém – All that fuss for nothing The 30th World Climate Conference in Belém is not yet over, but it is already becoming apparent that the event, announced as the “Conference of Truth,” will go down in the history of climate conferences as a turning point. No head of state from the four largest CO2-emitting nations—China (33%), the USA (12%), India (8%), and Russia (5%)—is showing up in Belém. Even before the conference, the New York Times headlined: “The whole world is fed up with climate policy.” And the fact that Bill Gates, one of the biggest supporters and sponsors of climate policy, explicitly warned against excessive, shortsighted climate policy just 14 days before the conference, and put prosperity back in focus — a major blow. Glenn Beck, a prominent American television host, explains the change of heart by Bill Gates: “It’s not about science, it’s about Trump.” Expressed differently: it’s not about conviction; it’s about damage control for his own company, which is planning multibillion-dollar investments in data centers in the USA and globally. And given the situation, these will have to rely on electricity from new gas-fired power plants in the short term, as the reactivation of old nuclear power plants will not suffice, and the construction of new nuclear power plants will still take several years in the USA. Only 1/3 of the states actually submit a plan For the Climate Conference in Belém, states had to report on their future plans for the use of coal, oil, and gas. The fact that only one-third even submitted a statement already hints at the dissolving importance of the climate issue in most nations around the world. But the reports that were submitted are revealing. Most states reported continuously increasing use of coal, oil, and gas. The reports show an increase in global coal usage by 30%, oil by 25%, and gas by 40% by 2030 compared to 2015. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) hoped to reduce global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2015; now they are continuing to rise. Only Europe onboard Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Germany, the industrial heart of Europe, is even more ambitious and, according to Axel Bojanowski, is “the ‘leader’ among industrialized countries: It aims to be climate-neutral by 2045 – a self-destructive plan: Germany’s reduction will inevitably be compensated by rising emissions in other EU countries. This is because the European Emissions Trading System ensures that emission allowances not used in Germany are consumed in other EU countries. It is becoming increasingly clear what the Wall Street Journal meant when it called Germany’s energy policy the ‘dumbest in the world.’ A few days before the conference, the European states agreed on a common goal, namely to achieve a 90% CO2 reduction by 2040 compared to 1990. 5% of the self-commitment could come from emission reductions abroad, which, of course, must also be expensively paid for. The German Minister for the Environment celebrated this agreement as “good news for the German economy, as everyone would now have the same competitive conditions.” This statement reveals how little the German federal government and its ministers understand about the global economy. As if German industry only exports goods to European countries. German goods, however, compete in a global market that does not have the burdens of CO2 taxes and high energy prices on German products and can therefore always offer them more cheaply. 50% of exports go to countries outside the EU. Chancellor Merz and his Environment Minister Schneider are blatantly downplaying the German situation. Germany has set self-imposed shackles with the Climate Protection Act that will become highly painful in the coming years. German climate policy: “script for an economic catastrophe” Welt journalist Axel Bojanowski: “The German Climate Protection Act, cemented by the Federal Constitutional Court, seems to be a script for an economic catastrophe. It only allows Germany a remaining budget of 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2, which is likely to be used up by the early 2030s. According to the law, penalties, shutdowns, and restrictions on freedom are then threatened to meet the climate goals.” 6.7 gigatonnes was the remaining permissible budget after the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court from 2020 onwards. As of today, only 3.6 gigatonnes of this remain. The buffer is reduced by about 0.5 gigatonnes each year. By 2032 at the latest, the remaining budget will be exhausted, and Germany will have reached the end of the line set by the Federal Constitutional Court. This will happen in the next legislative period, not just in 2040. Chancellor Merz whitewashes And in his 5-minute speech in Belém before a half-empty hall, Chancellor Merz spreads negligent whitewashing: “The economy is not the problem. Our economy is the key to protecting our climate even better.” Does the Chancellor not know the perilous state our industry is in? Scandal surrounds tropical forest Ffund (TFF) Probably the only outcome of the Belém conference will be the establishment of an investment fund, proposed by Brazilian President Lula, to finance the protection of tropical forests. The fund works as follows: Donor countries pay $25 billion into the fund. Private investors (investment funds) are supposed to pay in $100 billion. The donor countries receive a return of about 4.0-4.8%, which corresponds to the return on their government bonds, as they generally have to raise the money through government debt. The return for private investors is 5.8% to 7.2%. The fund’s money is invested in emerging market government bonds, which yield comparatively high interest due to the higher risk (Brazilian government bonds are currently at 12.25%). Private investors are served first, followed by the donor countries. If anything remains after the distribution of profits to private investors and donor countries, the amount is paid out to 74 countries with tropical forests. It is hoped that this way, $3-4 billion will be distributed annually to the tropical forest countries. The catch is this: To entice investors, private investors are given preference in the payment sequence: first the private ones, then the donor states. Furthermore, the donor countries must insure the fund against default. A default by an emerging market could quickly lead to the fund’s insolvency. In that case, the taxpayers of the donor countries would be held liable and, in an extreme scenario, lose their capital. Disadvantageous for the German taxpayer In preparation for Belém, there was fundamental disagreement over Germany’s participation in the fund between the Ministry of Finance and the Chancellor’s Office. The Chancellor’s Office clearly advocated for participation and a contribution of at least $1 billion. It was assisted by the Ministry for the Environment under Minister Schneider and the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development under Minister Alabali-Radovan. The Ministry of Finance, under Lars Klingbeil, strongly objected, viewing the fund as a billion-dollar risk and doubting the viability of the fund’s structure. And indeed, the model is structurally disadvantageous for the German taxpayer. One could also say: We are subsidizing the returns of private investors with public money and providing the default guarantee for BlackRock and Co. That is why the Federal Ministry of Finance is persistently blocking Germany’s participation in the fund. It can be unequivocally stated that the Federal Ministry of Finance has thus far bravely defended the interests of the German taxpayer against the interests of BlackRock and Co. This is the background to Chancellor Merz being unable to name a figure (“a noteworthy amount”) in Belém. The billion € or $ is now supposed to be found in the budget reconciliation for the 2026 federal budget, which is taking place this week, so that the federal budget can be adopted on November 28. It is to be expected that the SPD will concede. But it could be a Pyrrhic victory for Chancellor Merz, who would then visibly be prioritizing the interests of international financial investors, especially if the fund were to run into difficulties. Whether the fund will ultimately materialize is still questionable, as it only comes into effect if the donor states commit to $10 billion. So far (excluding Germany), $5.6 billion has been raised. The USA and the UK have already declined. If the fund comes into being, the investment companies will profit first, with high returns secured by states, and then the emerging markets, which can sell their high-risk government bonds. Whether the tropical forest will benefit in this confusing financial jungle is not yet certain. The biggest risk remains with the donor countries, who are putting their taxpayers’ money at risk with the catchy story of saving the rainforest.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe Realisation emerges…EVENTUALLY It ought to some day cease to amaze me what lengths these clowns go to to simulate, poorly, real free markets, piling ineptitude on top of corruption. I wonder how many of Lula’s friends are going to profit from all this nonsense. The poor taxpayers sure won’t. That’s the second place wonder, that voters are still voting in these clowns. “that voters are still voting in these clowns.” I don’t think those voters would vote for those clowns if they were told the truth about those clowns. Unfortunately, the Propaganda News Media distorts the truth about those clowns and make them appear to be fine candidates for election to office. The problem is the voters don’t get the truth and end up believing something that isn’t true, and then base their decisions on that. Propaganda News Media are a great danger to the freedoms of all of us, including the freedoms of the people they fool into voting for the wrong people. Europe has made enormous investments in wind/solar/battery infrastructure, which is not making any money, or losing money, or retrenching. Europe was planning to screw the US with high energy prices per kWh by using European designed, built, erected, owned and operated wind, solar and battery systems to maintain its competitive trade advantage for decades more. Trump prevented that plan and imposed tariffs to offset Europe’s numerous, intricate, non-tariff barriers. “or losing money, or retrenching.” For clarity: “or is losing money, or is retrenching” lol right, you are Netzero macht frei. I recall an old saying, “Reality is a bitch.” Just when you think government can’t get any worse here comes more stupid government. What a bunch of knuckleheads! The global temperature did not change in October compared to August. The cooling trend remains intact. Was it Bellman, or The Last Nail in the Head who said the IPCC say there has been no natural variation, so what on Earth is causing the down-turn in temperatures? It should be going UP!! 🙁 Temperature will continue down trend until 2029. The solar activity is declining and the Z-axis excursion hits a minimum in 2029 but still north of Earth’s elliptic. Temperature will then climb to mid 2030s with rising solar activity and new northern maximum excursion of the orbit mid 2030s similar to 2023. Then a reasonably rapid decline to a southern minimum in 2040 similar to the minimum of 1980. If climate models used solar intensity at latitudes for seasons, they would be able to show natural variation but they don’t so are useless for showing natural variation. It’s been cooling for almost two years now. Maybe CO2 has suddenly stopped going into the atmosphere? The latest peak was due to a volcanic explosion and a medium-strength El Niño almost coinciding in their effects. The cows have stopped farting, because they don’t want corks in their butts. Our man in Belem is leading by example- flying in and out twice. 24,000 miles. Yeah, this is the complete idiot who says “homegrown energy independence and security,” when the UK produces not one tonne of the metals and minerals required for the construction of ALL renewable equipment, batteries, and for a 3-fold extension of the grid – NOT 1 TONNE. He idiotically fails to realise that we totally relinquish energy independence and security to the Chinese by continuing with this renewable nonsense – the Chinese totally control the supply of the refined global production of those very metals and minerals. What a complete and utter idiot. Where mad Ed is concerned I have run out of negative superlatives. Latest figures from the ONS show GDP grew by just 0.1% in July to September, slower than economists’ expected 0.2%. Unemployment shoots up Here comes that budget … Deindustrialising the economy part II. “What a complete and utter idiot.” Ed Miliband is not a complete idiot. ﻿ Some parts are still missing … but he’s working on that. Such as his brain You win! He has a running sore and forgot his diaper. He will be gone soon. IS a running sore. It only allows Germany a remaining budget of 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2, which is likely to be used up by the early 2030s. This is farcical thinking. It will not be used up. Germany is in economic decline and full de-industrialisation mode. They can just buy stuff from China like everyone else. The one advantage of the decline is that it will slow immigration. Africa will be considerably more attractive than Germany within a decade. So what happens when Germany has used up it’s carbon budget? Do they have to switch everything off? With no economy they won’t be able to afford to buy anything from abroad. Good luck to Germany, you’ll need it. No – Germans will start killing their politicians , like everywhere in Europe. Then the assassination attempts that as of now only targeted populist leaders Gladio 3.0 style, will be more grassroot style,have a logical motivation and target the WEF – Blackrock assets. Until then it’ll be interesting to see how they’ll switch towards a war economy (Russia) and increase weapon production while everything else is in decline. First, Germany destroys itself with Naziism. Now it is in the process of shooting itself in the foot with these Net Zero and green energy religions. If there something about Germans that causes them to do things like this to themselves twice in a century? Is it something in their culture or is it the way they think or are raised? Do they (And the British?) look at the alarmist and other scientists as authority figures that command the same respect as royalty on a continent with a history of royalty? Yes, we had climate alarmism take hold here in the U.S. as well. But, as noted elsewhere, it appears to be dying out here as opposed to Europe where is seems to persist. Maybe its just the leadership we all put in office during elections. Just a lot of speculation on my part for whatever it is worth. “Maybe its just the leadership we all put in office during elections.” It is definitely the leadership we elect. The United States would be going down the same “Road to Ruin” as the Germans and the UK, if a Democrat had been elected president of the U.S. The Natives are restless in Europe. Maybe, if there are enough of them, they can change directions, away from the current ruinous energy policy. Otherwise, their economies will crash and burn, and then the voters will change direction. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that, and they wake up to reality before that happens. “First, Germany destroys itself with Naziism. Now it is in the process of shooting itself in the foot with these Net Zero and green energy religions.” NetZism At some point, someone will notice that world levels of atmospheric CO2 have not stopped rising. After that, they will also notice that the rate of rise continues to accelerate as well. It’s hard to point to your policy achievements when there aren’t any. Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050. That isn’t quite true. China remains unshakably committed to the goal of everyone else achieving Net Zero by 2050. Yes, to China, Net Zero for everyone else is a huge success! From the article: “It is becoming increasingly clear what the Wall Street Journal meant when it called Germany’s energy policy the ‘dumbest in the world.’” Truer words were never spoken. No country in the world has a dumber energy policy than Germany. The UK’s energy policy is equally dumb, and they are right behind Germany in the race to destroy their economies with insane energy policies. What is it? Are European politicians particularly gullible to climate change propaganda? “German Energy Professor: COP 30 Is A Failure…”Only Europe Remains Committed”” Germany has it figured out. Copilot AI tells us, “Approximately 90% of Porsche vehicles are sold outside of Germany.” The net zero thing is pointless. There is no real evidence that CO2 has any effect on our global glimate system. The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science. Spending money to fight climate change is just a big waste of funds. Funny. There is no “global climate system.” There may be a global energy system that includes the dozens of micro climates with coupled land, sea, and air energy transport systems. How can the Sahara desert be the same climate as the rain forests the same climate as Antarctica? We must embrace scientific definitions and stop using common language, context driven, vocabulary. Likewise the definition of climate is statistics. The definition of climate change (at whatever level) is statistics. It is extreme hubris to say that humans can control weather, globally or locally. Do humans affect the plane?. Yes. Are there problems? Yes. But must we destroy civilization to save the planet? Not only no, but hell no. Correction: (typo) Do Humans affect the planet? Thanks for that, but remember… we do not appreciate Common Sense. We are not programmed to respond in that area… EU remains committed to suicide. Without the collection plate they’ve given up fighting climate change and are now busy fighting all their so called disinformation and misinformation in order to save their butts- ‘COP of truth’: Countries commit to tackling climate disinformation at UN climate summit They’ve run out of taxes and with red ink everywhere printing more money goes straight into inflation post Covid. To make things worse they’ve hit the wall with fickles penetration with the exponential cost of moving it around over space and time. You pluck the early low hanging fruit with solar and wind in the best areas close to existing infrastructure and it’s all uphill from there. Germany is wholehog solar panel, wind mills,and Russian LNG. The country is flooded with illegal aliens. and China is their biggest customer. The government of Germany has committed to doubling his defense budget. It’s only a matter of time before Germany. Economy has a freefall. I am not sure China is a customer. Supplier, perhaps? and Calif – $8-$9 gas may be the end of Newsome The cartels will figure out how smuggle into CA Mexican gas that they steal by hijacking tanker trucks. Maybe they could put pipes into all those drug tunnels they keep digging. Reminds me of a gas war movie. Can’t recall the title. Do folks still smoke pipes for drugs? DOJ may soon be ‘investigating’ Neuscom. As I like to say, it’s a thin line between being committed, and ought to be committed. More socialist “finance” ministers who lack an even basic understanding of finance. “emerging market government bonds, which yield comparatively high interest due to the higher risk” When aggregated together, government, private and emerging markets all return pretty much the same over all rate of return. First world government bonds return low rates, but very few of them ever fail to pay out. Private funds pay a higher rate of return, but a higher percentage of them go belly up. Emerging market government bonds pay even more, but a still higher percentage of them will go bankrupt before paying out. This fund seems to be predicated on the belief that all three types of funds will be equally safe. The reality is that it’s a poorly disguised scheme to transfer first world government and private investor funds to 3rd world kleptocracies with probably a non-trivial amount being fed back to certain first world finance ministers under the table. The fact that the private investors are also being indemnified against loss is a further indicator that payoffs are being made. “to arrange the transfer of more funds to Blackrock et al.” VW reluctantly closed its plant in the forced labor part of western China. But Germany and the EU are still committed to the forced labor supply chain from there. They have experience with that from the 1930s and 40s, in addition to colonialism. It is time to abandon the climate change narrative and its consequence: the energy transition. FIFTY (50) years of effort to convince the world of a non-happening so that several hundred $trillion can be wasted on “green” energy is coming to its natural end – bankruptcy. Lysenkoism failed and anthropogenic climate change has failed. Nature responds to truth, not fiction. “Germany….. is “the ‘leader’ among industrialized countries.” Not for long though. Soon Germany won’t be ‘industrialized’. Climate Protection Act that will become highly painful in the coming years. – ugh – the WSJ reports that electricity in Germany is now considered to be a luxury and not affordable by many Germans who have resorted to felling timber for heat and cooking – now that’s green progress? seems that the coming years have arrived Is Europe really all that committed? King of Sweden questions the cost of CO2 net zero: Swedish monarch King Carl XVI Gustaf, well-known for his lifelong environmental engagement, landed in a bit of hot water at COP30, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Belém, Brazil, by questioning how much of the world’s climate challenges Europe is supposed to take financial responsibility for. In an interview with Swedish state broadcaster Sveriges Radio, the monarch said he doesn’t believe the conference will be able to come to an agreement. “We all have to take our own responsibilities and try to do the best we can,” he said, pointing out that Europe is already taking significant steps to limit CO2 emissions. In an interview with Swedish state broadcaster Sveriges Radio, the monarch said he doesn’t believe the conference will be able to come to an agreement. “We all have to take our own responsibilities and try to do the best we can,” he said, pointing out that Europe is already taking significant steps to limit CO2 emissions. “Europe produces only 6%,” he said. “And everyone complains that it’s too much. But the rest of the world is much, much worse.” “Europe produces only 6%,” he said. “And everyone complains that it’s too much. But the rest of the world is much, much worse.” https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/king-of-sweden-at-cop30-how-much-are-we-supposed-to-pay/ This comment from professor Verenholt would not be the first time that a German bureaucrat pretended to speek for the whole of Europe. From the above article: “Only Europe remains unshakably committed to the goal of achieving Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050.” Today, the European Union emits a total of a little more than 6% of the world’s annual CO2 emissions (see https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions ). So, keep the faith and virtue signaling EU, you are making a difference, albeit insignificant since the atmosphere is shared with all nations around the world. I can confidently state that Net Zero will NEVER be achieved globally. World-wide Net Zero is a Pipe Dream. Too many politicians on the ‘pipe’, it seems. I have a hard time believing that Germany is committing economic suicide faster than Canada but I guess it’s possible. Just like Germany, over half the population is too stupid to see what is coming. Take it from the German Treasury. These EUpeons need to be slapped silly to get them to stop strangling their citizens with suicidal beliefs. Get out of the EU.

Title: As industry layoffs become the ‘new normal’, so does fear of AI’s impact on adland’s job market

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit Job cuts made at Brandtech group media agency Jellyfish may be the latest symptom of a contracting advertising and marketing job market. The company cut as many as 50 roles at the end of October, following a slowdown in client spending, Digiday has learned. “Our existing clients were spending less money, some of those were retracting the projects that they had planned, and that obviously led to a revenue hit,” said one exec whose role was cut in the layoffs and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Jellyfish confirmed the cuts. “Like everyone in marketing, our business is dynamic and we are constantly making shifts in our resources, redesigning roles and structures,” said a spokesperson. “At 8% we have one of the lowest churn rates in the industry. Currently there is a very small number of roles affected in the U.S. and U.K.” Those let go face difficult circumstances. One ad-tech executive made redundant earlier this year, who exchanged candor for anonymity, told Digiday that 11 months on, they were still without a permanent position. Compared with previous job markets, they said new positions were thinner on the ground. “Back then I could walk out of a job and walk into five interviews the following day. Now, I can’t get the interview,” they said. “It’s a tough market.” Jellyfish’s cuts are small, compared with the job losses at holding company agencies in recent months. Forrester analysis suggests agency headcounts have fallen 8% in 2025. In August, Dentsu committed to eliminating 3,400 jobs worldwide, approximately 8% of its staff. WPP, meanwhile, cut 7,000 during the final months of Mark Read’s CEO tenure; 700 came from Ogilvy alone. Interpublic Group has laid off 3,200 employees this year, while its to-be acquirer Omnicom already cut its global headcount by 3,000 jobs in 2024 and has been working to reduce staff costs by 10% in the run-up to that merger’s completion. Once the deal is complete, it expects to find $750 million in cost savings — given labor costs always lead the balance sheet, that’s not great news for the thousands working under each umbrella. “Layoffs have become the new normal,” said the former Jellyfish exec. But industry job losses aren’t limited to agencies. In October, TikTok cut 400 jobs in the U.K. from its Trust and Safety Team, while Target cut 1,800 white-collar positions, and Amazon recently announced plans to reduce its corporate workforce by 14,000 roles. CPG giant Nestlé plans to cut 12,000 office staff. Between August and December 2024 (the most recent data), the American ad industry lost 4,600 roles overall according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And data from Britain’s Office for National Statistics showed job openings in the advertising and marketing industries had fallen 7.5% between 2022 and 2025. That’s set against rising unemployment in the U.S. (4.3% in August) and the U.K. (5% in September); U.S. firms, particularly retailers, announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Some of the firms responsible have laid out their own justifications for reducing headcount. A historic merger here; long-term underperformance there; a restructuring ahead of a potential sale. Add them all together, and a pattern emerges. “What we’re seeing is layoffs as a result of restructuring and financial distress,” said Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, who referenced an estimate by Madison & Wall that suggested the four largest holdcos averaged just 0.3% organic growth in Q3, the lowest for five years. “If you’ve got a category that is in effect growing less than 1% then yes, they’re shedding jobs, because jobs are the number one overhead,” he added. This year’s job cuts can be traced to restructuring and client cutbacks. But generative AI is the ghost at the leaving party. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” said Beth Galetti, svp of people experience and technology at Amazon, in an Oct. 28 blog post sent to Amazon employees. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Naveen Tewari, CEO of ad tech firm InMobi, warned in February that AI progress meant his software engineers “will not have jobs within two years.” Statements like Tewari’s are leaving marketing execs looking for their next role worried they’re going to be frozen out, experience be damned. The anonymous ad tech exec voiced fears that older workers could be disproportionately affected, and that a perception they’re less adept with gen AI tools could be used as cover for ageist discrimination. 40% of advertising staffers aged between 40 and 55 feel their age has limited their career, according to research by the IPA and the Advertising Association. “It does start to feel like ageism and a slight white male-ism,” they said. Pattisall suggested that while this year’s layoffs can be primarily traced to restructuring pushes, next year’s will be provoked by AI. Two years ago, Forrester predicted that AI, automation and efficiency initiatives would result in a net 7.5% reduction in the U.S. advertising workforce. Its most recent report upgraded that estimate to 15% by the end of next year. Again, this isn’t limited to ad agencies. Over a quarter of private-sector employers expect to cut staff as a result of AI, according to a survey of 2,000 firms by the Chartered Institue of Personnel and Development, the U.K. professional body for HR. 62% said they believed that admin and managerial roles were most at risk. “The technology was nascent when we developed that forecast in in mid-2023,” explained Pattisall. “We had not factored for agentic and agents. I think we’ll see a larger percentage of the advertising population that can be replaced by those tools.” — Jessica Davies contributed reporting to this story Walmart’s website says its meal costs 25% less than the basket it offered last year, and that the turkey was at the lowest price since 2019. Google is pushing Demand Gen and YouTube to ad partners, hedging against the inevitable erosion of its search business by AI chatbots. The arrival of the Agentic RTB Framework this week lands as this week lands as the third agentic standard in under a month.

by Michael Snyder | Nov 12, 2025 | Economics | 0 comments This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second-lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Title: AMD Eyes Trillion-Dollar AI Chip Market

Exciting news for investors! Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced ambitious growth projections for its data center business. The company forecasts a potential $100 billion in annual revenue from data center chips within the next five years, accompanied by a threefold increase in profits. The Santa Clara, California-based chip design company saw its stock initially dip by 2.7% to $237.52 after market close, but quickly rebounded with a 4% increase in volatile trading as markets opened. This positive momentum builds upon a 16% increase in AMD’s share price since October 6th. This rise coincided with AMD securing a multi-year agreement with OpenAI, a deal expected to generate tens of billions of dollars annually. While this agreement may not immediately challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market, it signals growing confidence in AMD’s chip technology. The company’s optimistic financial outlook, revealed on Tuesday, is anticipated to alleviate investor concerns. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the data center chip market is expected to reach a staggering $1 trillion by 2030. She shared this forecast at an analyst day event in New York, highlighting the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving this growth. The market includes AMD’s general-purpose processors, networking chips, and specialized AI chips. “This is a very exciting market,” Su stated. “The data center is the largest growth opportunity right now, and AMD is incredibly well positioned for it.” Over the next three to five years, AMD projects an annual growth rate of 35% for its overall business, with a remarkable 60% growth rate specifically for its data center business, as announced by AMD’s Chief Financial Officer, Jean Hu. The company is targeting earnings per share of up to $20 within this timeframe. For context, Reuters cited an LSEG estimate predicting AMD’s 2025 profit at $2.68 per share. The future looks bright for AMD in the high-performance computing and artificial intelligence landscape. Nep123.com is your reliable source for news, stories, and insights from Nepal.

Title: In America’s K-Shaped Economy, The Rich Are Getting Richer While Almost Everyone Else Is Getting The Sharp End Of The Stick

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Pundits have been talking a lot about America’s “K-shaped economy” lately, but most average people on the street have no idea what that means. Basically, it means that the wealthy are getting even wealthier while almost everyone else is getting monkey-hammered. Yesterday, I detailed 11 signs that economic conditions in the U.S. are the worst that they have been since the Great Recession, but if you have plenty of money you may feel like everything is just great right now. For those at the top of the economic pyramid, it could be argued that these are the best of times because the stock market has been soaring. But for many of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, it literally feels like we are in the midst of a horrifying economic crisis. At a time when the cost of living is crushing most of the population, debt levels are exploding, and mass layoffs are happening all over the nation, we continue to see “strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans”… Experts describe the current U.S. economy as “K-shaped,” a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the “K” represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans. By contrast, the letter’s lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs. The top 10 percent of all income earners have always spent more money than everyone else. But now the proportion of consumer spending that they are accounting for has reached the highest level ever recorded… These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi. “That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it’s ever been in the data,” he told CBS News. If you are thriving in this very difficult economic environment, that is a good thing. However, you should also be aware that most people are really struggling, and that is especially true for low-income Americans. In fact, the percentage of subprime borrowers that are “at least 60 days past due on their auto loans” just shot up to the highest level we have ever seen… More Americans than ever are falling behind on their car payments. The share of subprime borrowers at least 60 days past due on their auto loans rose to 6.65% in October, the highest in data going back to 1994, according to Fitch Ratings. With ongoing inflation pressures and the return of student loan bills, millions of car owners are struggling to afford their monthly payments. It’s the latest sign of weakness in the US economy as the Federal Reserve considers the path of future rate cuts. We never even got a number this bad during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. As a result, vehicle repossessions are absolutely soaring. This is the economic reality that most of us are living in. According to one recent survey, 55 percent of American workers are concerned that they could soon lose their jobs… Some 55% of employed Americans say they’re concerned about losing their jobs, according to a recent Harris Poll conducted for Bloomberg News. That angst follows a drumbeat of layoff announcements by major employers, including Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Starbucks Corp. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. calculated the most job cut announcements for any October in more than two decades. It comes layered on top of households’ exasperation over the cost of living. A 62% majority in the Oct. 23-25 poll said the cost of their everyday items had climbed over the last month and nearly half of those people said the increases have been difficult to afford. In previous recessions, low paid workers got laid off in very high numbers. This time around, it is highly paid workers that are getting hit particularly hard. Even highly successful tech companies such as Amazon are eliminating good paying jobs… Amazon is laying off almost 700 corporate workers based in New York City as part of the company’s nearly 14,000 corporate layoffs. The layoffs, which were first reported by Crain’s New York, were disclosed in a filing with the New York State Department of Labor. In total, 660 employees are being laid off by Amazon across nine offices in New York City. Among them, the largest layoffs affect Amazon’s Manhattan West office and its New York Tech Hub, also based in Manhattan. It appears that the employment market is really starting to deteriorate. And the most recent weekly report from ADP seems to confirm this… Recent announcements of large layoffs at a few prominent companies have raised concerns that the labor market could be weakening further, and today’s new weekly ADP employment report confirms that fear. The ADP weekly jobless report pointed to a deterioration in US labor momentum, stating that “for the four weeks ending Oct. 25, 2025, private employers shed an average of 11,250 jobs a week, suggesting that the labor market struggled to produce jobs consistently during the second half of the month.” Added together that is 45,000 job losses in the month (not including government workers), which would be the largest monthly drop in jobs since March 2023… But if you have lots of cash in the bank and you are not concerned about the security of your job, you might be feeling pretty good right about now. As Peter Atwater has aptly noted, those that are sitting at the top are “spending like there’s no tomorrow”… Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts, said that the biggest division is America is not on the left and right, it’s up and down between those at the top and bottom of the US economy. For those at the top, the economy looks good and they are ‘spending like there’s no tomorrow.’ But Atwater says Americans on the bottom are already facing recession conditions, as people struggle with affordability. Of course the prosperity that high earners are currently experiencing is just temporary. Anyone that thinks that this stock market bubble is sustainable is simply not being rational. Key ratios were not even this out of whack during the most euphoric days of the Dotcom bubble. What goes up must come down. But for now the wealthy are living the high life while most of the rest of us really struggle to make ends meet from month to month.

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Are Almost Here. Investors Are Already Worried About the AI Rally.

Nvidia is slated to report quarterly results next Wednesday. It could be a make-or-break moment for the bull market. Anxiety about AI is running high on Wall Street heading into Nvidia's (NVDA) print. AI stocks weighed on the broader market last week, when the Nasdaq notched its worst weekly performance since early April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement roiled markets. The mood improved to start the week amid signs that the government was moving closer to reopening. But AI jitters returned after Japanese investment firm SoftBank on Tuesday said it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia: Shares of both companies slumped despite SoftBank executives clarifying that the sale was made to fund other AI investments, not a sign that the company had soured on the chipmaker. Nvidia's quarterly earnings report is one of the most closely followed events on Wall Street. Investors parse Nvidia's results and guidance for confirmation that the AI infrastructure buildout, which made the chipmaker the world's most valuable company and has help power partners' and competitors' shares higher, is continuing. Some investors are increasingly concerned that an AI bubble is forming, fueled by a series of circular business deals, massive AI investments, and optimism about the technology’s near-term commercial utility. Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, recently revealed his hedge fund had shorted $1.2 billion of Nvidia and Palantir (PLTR) stock as of the end of September. The major hyperscalers—tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year and next as they construct data centers and outfit them with the advanced chips and support equipment required the train and run artificial intelligence. That spending has been a boon to companies like Nvidia, whose sales and earnings have soared over the past three years. But some investors question whether the hyperscalers would recoup their investments. BCA Research analysts last week suggested shorting hyperscaler stocks, citing their belief that the speed and scale of AI investments will weigh the companies' returns on equity, and thus their stock valuations, regardless of profit growth in their core businesses. “Our biggest fear would be a repeat of the telecom and fiber buildout experiences, where the revenue curve failed to materialize at a pace that justified continued investment,” wrote JPMorgan analysts on Wednesday. JPMorgan estimated that it would require about $650 billion of annual revenue indefinitely for tech companies to reap a 10% return on their AI investments through 2030. For scale, they likened that figure to nearly six basis points of global gross domestic product or nearly $35 a month from every current iPhone user. The growing importance of OpenAI to the rally has also raised eyebrows. According to CEO Sam Altman, the start-up recently reached an annualized revenue run rate of $20 billion. But JPMorgan estimates the ChatGPT maker has agreed to pay just three companies—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO)—between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion for data center capacity over the next 5 years. To be sure, many investors see ample reason to remain bullish on AI stocks—or, at least, that it's too hard to call the top to bet against them. They note that comparisons of today to the Dotcom Bubble ignore that tech valuations are below their Dotcom peaks, and that, unlike during the 1990s internet craze, the companies making the biggest investments in AI infrastructure are among the world's largest most profitable companies.

Rate cuts are also expected to increase liquidity in financial markets, likely boosting stock prices. AI excitement can still send a stock soaring despite the skeptics. Chipmaker AMD on Tuesday said it expects the AI chip market to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and that it is aiming to grow its share of that market to double digits.

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Are Almost Here. Investors Are Already Worried About the AI Rally.

Nvidia is slated to report quarterly results next Wednesday. It could be a make-or-break moment for the bull market. Anxiety about AI is running high on Wall Street heading into Nvidia's (NVDA) print. AI stocks weighed on the broader market last week, when the Nasdaq notched its worst weekly performance since early April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement roiled markets. The mood improved to start the week amid signs that the government was moving closer to reopening. But AI jitters returned after Japanese investment firm SoftBank on Tuesday said it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia: Shares of both companies slumped despite SoftBank executives clarifying that the sale was made to fund other AI investments, not a sign that the company had soured on the chipmaker. Nvidia's quarterly earnings report is one of the most closely followed events on Wall Street. Investors parse Nvidia's results and guidance for confirmation that the AI infrastructure buildout, which made the chipmaker the world's most valuable company and has help power partners' and competitors' shares higher, is continuing. Some investors are increasingly concerned that an AI bubble is forming, fueled by a series of circular business deals, massive AI investments, and optimism about the technology’s near-term commercial utility. Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, recently revealed his hedge fund had shorted $1.2 billion of Nvidia and Palantir (PLTR) stock as of the end of September. The major hyperscalers—tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year and next as they construct data centers and outfit them with the advanced chips and support equipment required the train and run artificial intelligence. That spending has been a boon to companies like Nvidia, whose sales and earnings have soared over the past three years. But some investors question whether the hyperscalers would recoup their investments. BCA Research analysts last week suggested shorting hyperscaler stocks, citing their belief that the speed and scale of AI investments will weigh the companies' returns on equity, and thus their stock valuations, regardless of profit growth in their core businesses. “Our biggest fear would be a repeat of the telecom and fiber buildout experiences, where the revenue curve failed to materialize at a pace that justified continued investment,” wrote JPMorgan analysts on Wednesday.

Title: Steam Frame vs. Quest 3 Specs: Better PC Streaming, Power & Hackability

VR games and user comfort are still big question marks Want to know how Valve’s newly announced Steam Frame standalone headset stacks up against the competition? Read on to find out. Steam Frame is a lot like Steam Deck; it can play pretty much all of Steam’s game library out of the box, which includes flatscreen content based on x86 architecture—basically everything on Steam—and also now PC VR games. That means you can download modern flatscreen and VR titles and play on-the-go, no wires or PC needed. More on that below. Primarily though, Valve says it’s designed to stream PC VR games wirelessly, which it does through a Wi-Fi 6E dongle you plug straight into your computer (or the newly announced Steam Machine). Our hands-on with Frame’s streaming quality was promising. Quest 3 can stream PC VR games too, albeit in a roundabout way that requires you to stream through your home’s Wi-Fi router, which can cause some bottlenecks since the video stream needs to go from your PC, to the router, and then to the headset. Valve’s solution cuts out that middle man. The big difference though is in power and game compatibility. While both Quest 3 and Frame feature ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon processors (Frame’s is more powerful), only Frame can natively play x86 Windows and Linux content thanks to its built-in compatibility layer. Quest 3 can only natively play games compiled for ARM—albeit from a massive library, all of which are certified to work on the headset. The same can’t be said about Frame just yet. Valve is distributing Frame dev kits ahead of Frame’s 2026 launch to make sure PC VR studios can optimize; we expect the company to also have some sort of badging system similar to Steam Deck too so users know what works great, okay, or not at all. That said, Valve isn’t stopping you from trying to download and play anything (x86) available on Steam. Another big difference is the hackability of Frame. The headset natively run SteamOS, although you can technically install any OS on it you want (or realistically can), since it’s an open platform and gives you direct access to Linux for all of your hacking needs. That’s something you definitely can’t do with Quest’s Horizon OS due to its locked bootloader (i.e. no root access). Valve is so confident in Frame’s SteamOS that the company tells Road to VR the operating system “would be great for other [VR] devices.” What’s more, Frame also has a user accessible expansion gen4 PCIe port, which supports up to two 2.5 Gbps cameras… or anything you can think of. Additionally, Frame sports an microSD card slot for up to 2TB of additional storage—both of them clear wins for makers and gamers looking to expand Frame out of the box. Steam Frame could also promise better comfort over Quest 3, although the jury is still out. The headset features a front ‘core’ component, including the displays and optics, which weighs in at only 190g, putting the bulk of the remaining 245g in the total 435g package to the headstrap, which features a rear-mounted battery (21.6 Wh lithium ion). The default config shipped in the box (above) notably lacks a top strap though, which Valve is selling as an optional add-on later to go along with Knuckles-style controller straps (below). Where things even out somewhat (at least on paper) is the headsets’ displays. Quest 3 serves up a 2,064 × 2,208 per-eye LCD, while Frame has a 2,160 × 2,160 per-eye LCD. Both are clocked up to a refresh rate of 72-120Hz, although Frame is said to allow up to 144Hz in an experimental mode. Still, Frame does let down in the passthrough department; it only has monochrome passthrough, harkening back to the Quest 2 days—an odd (and probably cost-saving) decision by the company. On the other hand, Quest 3 offers a full-color passthrough, which is undoubtedly the better way to not only checking on your surroundings occasionally while immersed in VR, but also play games on a giant screen in your living room. It’s undoubtedly early days, but Frame could be a very compelling package over Quest 3. Besides the raw spec sheet (seen below), a big missing piece in the equation though is still price and release date. Valve says we’re sure to learn more on that front in “early 2026,” which they say could come somewhere below Valve Index, which is priced ‘all-in’ at $1,000. In the meantime, you can read our deep dive review of Quest 3 and our hands-on with Steam Frame for more info. Valve Unveils Steam Frame VR headset to Make Your Entire Steam Library Portable: Valve shows off Steam Frame, the standalone headset that can stream and natively play your entire Steam library—with only a few caveats right now.

Steam Frame’s Price Hasn’t Been Locked in, But Valve Expects it to be ‘cheaper than Index’: No price or release date yet, but Valve implies Steam Frame will be cheaper than $1,000 for the full Index kit. Valve Says No New First-party VR Game is in Development: Valve launched Half-Life: Alyx (2020) a few months after releasing Index, but no such luck for first-party content on Steam Frame. Valve is Open to Bringing SteamOS to Third-party VR Headsets: Steam Frame is the first VR headset to run SteamOS, but it may not be the last. Valve Plans to Offer Steam Frame Dev Kits to VR Developers: Steam Frame isn’t here yet; Valve says it needs more time with developers first so they can optimize their PC VR games.

The first ever mainstream PC on face (not running a joke of a restricted tablet OS like everyone else) and it's not a proper "spatial computer" because it has monochromatic cameras and I assume no hand/finger tracking. I assume not regarding the finger tracking, unless it is compatible with those lighthouse things required to track the index. Your "Hands On" article states that the Steam Frame has a noticesble "screen-door" effect, whereas the Quest 3 does not. This makes the Steam Frame an unacceptable alternative. This is going to depend on the price, but the specs don't look great, disappointing you might say. At least I'm not kicking my self having bought a quest 3 not even two weeks ago… I was incredibly surprised by that, too Let's hope that this can be somewhat fixed/reduced between the current early development units and the Steam Frame Valve will actually ship to customers. After all the hype and waiting LMAO.. what a complete disappointment! Not just LCD but CRAP LCD (no local dimming and years old resolution). It's like it's half good in the new stuff it does, but it's stuck on an really crappy sub quest 3 (and I'm no fan of quest or any LCD in VR) with mono pass through and a higher price. It's weird and not very desirable. Most core PC VR users are saying NO and will go to high end microOLED (word on the streets already) and most noobs/casuals are like 'why should I upgrade from my quest?'.. .the rest are on PSVR2 on PS5 AND PC (like me) saying "this is worse much much worse than PSVR2 with 200 nits vs 100 nits, HDR, better controllers, Haptics, display port, OLED!!!!!! wider FOV… 3 years available and only around $400… Who exactly is going to buy Frame for anything other than just above or just under quest 3 price? Only good thing is it's not META. I would have considered and compromised with all the downsides if the FOV was better than index. Some people hyped this too much and expectations were too high I didn't know Vive was going to release a new headset and I found it pretty neat. If it's Quest 3 price I would definetelly but this instead of Quest. It has Eye Tracking, looks way more confortable and has this thingy to make the connection with wireless PCVR way smoother. I really don't care about passthrough, to be honest, I think Meta messed up spending money with Mixed Reality on a VR headset, It's terrible and does not make much sense to me. There is an astonishing difference between the reception from VR enthusiasts vs a general technical audience. While here the overall reaction is mostly negative due to the underwhelming specs, on sites like Ars Technica with a very technical audience there are mostly positive reactions from people saying they have been interested in VR, but didn't want a Meta based HMD or anything involving a lot of hassle. They see the Steam Frame as the easy plug'n'play solution they have been looking for. These people haven't had years long discussions about LCD vs. OLED or minimal pixel count, they were just looking for a wireless Steam version of a PSVR2, something you connect to a PC and it just works. And this is probably where the Frame with its moderate resolution, supported by eye tracking foveated streaming/rendering will actually rule, allowing for near tethered low latency and high quality without having to deal with Wifi configurations, and running PCVR decently even from mid-range GPUs not costing thousands. So yeah, expectations have a very big influence on the reception. Overall, I kinda agree with you. But maybe tone it down a little, there's still a few good points. Dedicated wireless streaming dongle with foveated streaming could be nice. Passthrough is not a big loss. The Snap S8G3 is significantly more powerful than the XR2, at least on paper. OS could be an important factor, and steamOS on deck is pretty great at what it does.. Also when comparing display you're ignoring the lenses. You can't do OLED plus pancake lenses, because they absorb to much light. Which is why psvr2 uses fresnel, with their small sweet spot and lower fov. If you want led with pancake, it's micro led. Which the vision pro, Samsung, and a few other premium headset do. But for an even higher price ! LCD is the only choice if you want pancake lenses while keeping price under 1k. I'd say it has a few significant advantages over Q3, even if nothing groundbreaking. But that's only if it retails at similar price, and I don't think it will. TL;DR: there are a number of things the Frame does great, and the performance could be quite good, but that depends a lot on what level of magic Valve pulled of regarding emulation speed and thermal controls for a SoC not designed for VR. The Frame lenses seem to be excellent, with basically no glare. The combination of foveated streaming and a dedicated 6GHz WiFi dongle also seams to offer an unprecedented solution that closely matches tethered HMDs in latency and clarity, at least according to Linus from Linus Tech Tips, a high frame rate, low latency fanatic. The SD8 Gen 3 can be significantly faster than the XR2 Gen 2. The XR2 uses only performance and efficiency cores, which run between 1.6GHz and 2.05GHz in Quest 3, while the matching SD8 Gen 2 runs them at 2.8GHz. And the SD8 Gen 3 features an additional, much larger and faster X4 high performance core at 3.3GHz, with the performance cores running at 3.15GHz. So its peak performance is much higher than any XR2, which is configured for permanent high load, clocking the cores lower to avoid thermal throttling. Qualcomm emphasized extra GPU performance with the XR2 Gen 3, adding about 150% compared to Quest 2, and Meta underclocks the CPU part to where you only see a 14% CPU improvement over Quest 2 in graphics heavy apps on (according to slides Meta showed during the Quest 3 introduction). This may be very important esp. for running (emulated or ported) PCVR games that are often physics heavy, expecting a much faster CPU than is available on mobile. The GPU performance may be the lesser issue here, as translation from DX8-12 to Vulkan is very efficient, and ETFR will further reduce the rendering load, but not the physics calulation load. The big problem is that the SD8 Gen 3 is a smartphone chip, targeting short high load bursts followed by longer idle times, where the phone would only use the efficiency or even just the extra low power cores, dramatically reducing power draw and heat production. SteamOS on the Steam Deck is basically the wet dream of mobile power optimization and power consumption, so there is a decent chance that Valve manages to pull off using a smartphone SoC in a VR HMD, when everybody else sticks to Qualcomm's XR2 line optimized for constant load without throttling, at the cost of lower clocks/performance. Agree on the analysis, but I think that more than the simple specs, it will be the ecosystems that will make a difference… Up to a point: Quest3 runs its own application PLUS Steam games on a PC. Steam frames runs Steam games smoother and have better PCVR streaming, but I suspect running Steam games standalone is going to be a very low end option… Nice AI sheet. :D Quest 3 528GB (WTF) and 1TB variants? Give me them please!

Title: Circle plans native token for Arc blockchain as Q3 profit surges

The stablecoin issuer considered stablecoin-denominated gas fees on Arc, but has a long-term goal of shifting to distributed governance. Stablecoin issuer Circle, the company behind the USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin, is planning a native token for its ARC layer-1 blockchain testnet, an enterprise-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine network. Circle launched the Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies. The company, which disclosed plans for the new token alongside its earnings on Wednesday, initially planned to center gas fees on the Arc network around USDC (USDC) and other stablecoins. According to a statement, Circle’s long-term goal is to pivot Arc to a decentralized governance model of geographically distributed validators: Cointelegraph reached out to Circle but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Circle’s Arc attracts South Korea’s first won-backed stablecoin experiment The company also disclosed its financial results for the third quarter of 2025, reporting revenue of $740 million, a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle reported net income of $214 million in Q3, representing a 202% gain over the period. However, costs also rose, with distribution and transaction costs rising by 74% compared with 2024, totaling $448 million in the last quarter. Additionally, operating costs rose by 70% in Q3, reaching $211 million, which the company attributed to a 14% increase in its workforce and higher compensation costs for employees. Circle’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a critical metric for publicly-traded stocks, increased by 78% year-over-year, totaling $166 million for the quarter. The launch of the Arc network highlights the growing institutional involvement in crypto and the shift toward application-specific blockchain networks tailored for specific use cases, platforms, and digital assets. Developers turning to application-specific blockchain networks aim to circumvent the relatively low speed, scalability issues, and high fees associated with general-purpose blockchain networks that handle mixed traffic. Hyperliquid and Injective protocols are examples of applications built on app-specific layer-1 blockchain networks. However, critics argue that app-specific blockchains fragment liquidity, are prone to hacking due to centralization, and lack the community support that is a feature of general-purpose blockchain networks with distributed governance.“Appchains also grossly underestimate the cost of infrastructure and compliance: explorers, custody, exchanges, oracles, bridges, toolkits, integrated development environments, on/off ramps, native issuance and integration, and regulatory compliance,” Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs, said. Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, the lead development team for the Polygon layer-2 blockchain network, disagreed with Cronje, arguing that more robust interoperability between blockchain networks is already happening and will solve these issues.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in the stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and gaming industries.

Title: Bitcoin – Why the $524M BTC rush is latest threat to ETH’s rally

Is this the comeback signal institutions were waiting for? Alt HD: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $524 million surge – Are institutions quietly accumulating BTC again? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) topped the list with $224.2 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s and Ark Invest’s ETFs. Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin slightly dipped 0.31%, trading around $104,772.57 at press time. After a turbulent start to November marked by steady outflows, Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs made a strong comeback on 11th November, recording a massive $524 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. There was a big increase in investments in Bitcoin recently, the largest in weeks. This suggests that investors might be feeling more positive about Bitcoin’s future after some uncertainty in the market. Among the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the surge with a remarkable $224.2 million in inflows. It was followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $165.9 million, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw inflows of $102.5 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $24.1 million, and Bitwise’s BITB brought in $7.3 million. The remaining Bitcoin ETFs, however, registered zero flows during the same period. Source: Carl Moon/X The timing of these inflows was particularly notable, as BTC was trading around $105,000 on the day of the surge. At the time of writing, BTC had slightly retreated to $104,772.57, marking a 0.31% decline in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the minor dip, the strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect renewed investor confidence and continued institutional interest amid broader market volatility. In contrast, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs faced a challenging day, recording total outflows worth $107.1 million. Grayscale’s ETHE led the downturn with $75.7 million in outflows, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw $19.8 million leave the fund. Other Ethereum-based ETFs also recorded modest outflows, while a few registered neutral activity with zero net flows. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,510.63, down 1.45% in the past 24 hours, signaling a brief cooling-off period after recent gains. On the other hand, Solana [SOL]-based Spot ETFs saw modest but positive traction. The two approved Solana ETFs, Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL, collectively recorded $8 million in inflows. Of this, GSOL contributed $5.9 million, while BSOL added $2.1 million. Meanwhile, SOL was trading at $159.25, reflecting a 2.41% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. These movements came amid a broader landscape where multiple altcoin ETFs remain pending approval, and major institutional players like BlackRock continue to exercise caution. Therefore, BlackRock’s cautious approach toward altcoin ETFs stems from its firm belief in Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only assets with lasting value.

Title: Easttree Media, BlackRock-Backed Investment Platform for TV, Film Income Rights, Launches at AFM (EXCLUSIVE)

By Alex Ritman A new investment company plans to take a leaf from the recent spate of musicians selling the rights to their own back catalogs and shift it into the film and TV space. Easttree Media, an investment platform acquiring income rights in some of what it claims are the “world’s most iconic films and television shows,” has announced its official launch at the American Film Market. Among it founders are two former execs from Hipgnosis, the ambitious management company that made headlines for splashing hundreds of millions of dollars on buying the rights to song catalogs from some of the world’s best known musicians. Related Stories Daniel Day-Lewis Says Brian Cox Dragged Him Into Method Actor Debate, Denies Claim That He Taught Jeremy Strong: 'I Don't Feel Responsible in Any Way' for How Strong Acts on Set Founded in the U.K., Easttree was backed by funds and accounts backed by U.S. investment management giant BlackRock in May of this year. Popular on Variety The company provides actors, writers, directors, producers and other rights holders — including production companies, studios and financiers — with what it says is the “ability to monetize all or part of their participation interests.” Focusing exclusively on passive profit participations in film and TV properties, it “enables sellers to monetise 100% of their income rights or pursue partial buyouts that create ongoing alignment and long-term revenue partnerships.” Easttree — which has already completed multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists — was founded in 2024 by Marc Allen, Chris Helm, and Markku Lonnqvist. Allen brings expertise from the film and TV entertainment space, having previously served as COO of the management and production company 42. Helm previously served as CFO Hipgnosis Songs Funds overseeing acquisitions of music catalogues. Lonnqvist most recently served as the Chief Investment Officer at Hipgnosis Song Management and was previously a partner at Pamplona Capital Management. “I’m proud to have created this business with our team and BlackRock,” said Allen. “Being able to provide such a service for such a broad range of talent, as well as sophisticated, high value solutions for the world’s largest film and TV entertainment industry players gives us a unique opportunity to work with creators, producers and platforms across the whole film and TV spectrum regardless of scale.” Added Helm: “Our vision is to approach film and TV participations through a fresh lens — bringing transparency, alignment and partnerships that serve talent. We’re firm believers that acquirors of music rights can scale, succeed commercially and still advocate for artists. We are bringing that same conviction to film and television, turning these income rights into a transformative new asset class.” Paul Braude, head of the direct private opportunities group at BlackRock, said: “We are pleased to collaborate with Easttree Media on their journey. Iconic film and television titles continue to attract audiences well beyond their initial release, and we believe these assets provide our clients with even greater choice to meet their investment needs alongside access to distinctive and durable source of returns.” Hipgnosis — which launched in 2018 — went on a spree of acquisitions between 2021 and 2023, acquiring the catalogs of artists including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and many more. It helped drive the price of music catalogs to new heights, but grew overextended and eventually sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6 billion.

Title: Trump snubs BofA CEO Brian Moynihan in White House dinner for Wall Street execs: sources

Full Content:
President Trump appears to have snubbed Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan as he hosts a White House dinner with top Wall Street executives on Wednesday — signaling a persistent rift between the pair over the “debanking” of the president following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, The Post has learned. Moynihan, CEO of the nation’s second-biggest bank, failed to score an invite to the Wednesday dinner — even as JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon received an invite and is expected to attend, according to sources. Other CEOs slated to attend include Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser was invited but won’t be able to attend, according to a source close to the situation. Fraser is believed to be in Trump’s good graces following a report last month that she secured a deal to begin managing Trump’s money. Dimon’s invite comes despite the fact that JPMorgan disclosed last week that it’s being probed over allegations it denied banking services to conservatives. Dimon, however, is known as a political moderate who has maintained a close relationship with Trump, who has often floated his name as a possible Treasury secretary. As for the BofA boss, “Trump has no great love for Moynihan,” according to a CEO who is slated to attend the Wednesday dinner. A White House spokesman declined to comment, as did a Bank of America spokesman. “We don’t take this as a snub,” a source close to Moynihan told The Post. “Brian gets invited to enough dinners.” The person pointed to a state dinner for Trump at Windsor Castle where Moynihan was in attendance and other top CEOs weren’t. But that dinner was hosted by King Charles III, not the White House. On Wednesday, Moynihan told Fox News he wants to meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to discuss the city’s future as competing states try to court concerned business owners away from the Big Apple. Trump has lashed out publicly against the BofA boss — on at least two occasions. The first was in January during a virtual Q&A session with the BofA CEO sitting on stage in Davos, Switzerland. In a TV interview this summer, Trump claimed BofA was among the banks that denied the Trump Organization services following his first term. Big banks like BofA and JPMorgan Chase blamed pressure from the nascent Biden administration to deny services to various right-leaning businesses and individuals including Trump. The specific reason for Trump and his family business concerned his involvement in the January 6 Capital Hill melee and the controversy surrounding it. Moynihan is considered one of Wall Street’s most progressive CEOs on various cultural issues, including employment practices like diversity, equity and inclusion as well as environmental social governance investing.

Never miss a story. Another issue for Moynihan has been his involvement in the culture wars that have swept academia pitting some of the most prestigious colleges against a White House determined to remove left-wing bias from campuses. He was chancellor of the corporation of Brown University when the notoriously left-leaning college voted on divesting its massive endowment from companies that do business with Israel, which leftists deemed an apartheid state committing genocide over its military response to the Oct. 7 murder of innocent Israelis by Hamas terrorists. The vote ultimately failed in its so-called corporation, the governing body of the university. Advertisement

President Trump is set to roll out the red carpet for Wall Street bigwigs, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, at a White House dinner on Wednesday evening, sources told The Post. Two insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman, and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick would also join the commander-in-chief tonight in Washington, D.C. News of the dinner, which is being seen as an attempt by Trump to drum up support for his economic agenda from America’s top business leaders, was first reported by CBS News. The president’s public schedule shows that a dinner will take place in the White House’s state dining room at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Post has approached the White House for comment. It comes after increased scrutiny of this administration’s handling of economic issues and consumer costs, after hard-left Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral race by focusing on the spiralling cost of living in the Big Apple. The real estate mogul won backing from corporate America during his 2024 campaign by pledging to slash taxes and red tape, although his move to slap hefty tariffs on imported goods has disrupted Uncle Sam’s trade flows and disrupted markets worldwide. JPMorgan’s Dimon also warned Trump of the dangers of undermining Fed Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who came under fire after The Post broke the news of his $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank’s downtown DC HQ, prompting uproar among Republicans in Congress. This newspaper also exclusively reported that the Trump campaign’s top staff had used the 69-year-old veteran chief executive as a “sounding board” for shaping their economic policies before the president’s crushing electoral win over Kamala Harris in November last year. Trump and Dimon met for the first time in years when they held talks at the Oval Office in July to discuss economic and regulatory policies. In September, the president hosted a similar dinner for technology leaders, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook, where the corporate titan committed to expanding domestic investments, especially in artificial intelligence, an area prioritized by the administration.

Firms will pay out money in fiat USD, and recipients will receive the money in dollar-pegged stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, the world’s second largest stablecoin by capitalization. It doesn’t appear that companies will be able to send stablecoins directly via the scheme. Visa did not mention if or when support for stablecoins other than USDC would be added, though it didn't say the service would be exclusive to USDC. Anyone who wants to use the service to receive payments will need both a stablecoin wallet and to pass customary AML/KYC checks, and the pilot is currently limited to platforms and businesses based in the U.S. Visa earmarked the service as being useful for the creator and gig economy. For example, firms like TikTok or YouTube, which deliver small, irregular payments to millions of people globally, though no participants were announced. Visa says it is in the process of onboarding partners, with wider access projected for some point in the second half of 2026, depending on local regulations. The pilot comes as part of Visa Direct, the payment giant’s service that allows users to conduct payments using its own payment rails rather than, for example, those of two banks. The payments giant also didn’t confirm what payment rails the service might use, but it’s been linking up with Circle on stablecoin infrastructure as of late. In late October, Circle announced that Visa was among the firms participating in its new public testnet for Arc, its Layer-1 blockchain network, alongside companies such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Visa has made a series of increasingly bullish moves in the stablecoin space during 2025. In May, it poured an unspecified amount into London-based stablecoin infrastructure company BVNK as a “strategic investment” via its Visa Ventures arm. Earlier this month, Visa issued a report predicting an increased role for stablecoins in the $40 trillion global credit market, saying that stablecoin-based lending could allow traditional institutions to bring parts of that market onto programmable, blockchain-based rails. Meanwhile, like rival Mastercard, Visa has been adding support for stablecoin-based crypto credit cards—including with fintech Rain in the U.S., and Bridge, a unit of payments giant Stripe, in Latin America.

Title: AMD CEO Lisa Su Said AI Demand Is ‘Insatiable.’ The Chipmaker's Stock Is Soaring

Advanced Micro Devices shares are getting a boost from its outlook. The stock was up about 10% in early trading Wednesday, leading gains on the S&P 500 after the chipmaker yesterday unveiled ambitious new targets at its first analyst day. (Read our daily markets coverage here.) Chip stocks were broadly rising, too, with the SOX index of semiconductor shares up 1.5%. CEO Lisa Su on Tuesday told analysts the company is seeing "insatiable" AI demand, suggesting that its revenue growth could climb to 35% per year over the next three to five years, with gross margins of 55% to 58%. AMD (AMD) said last week its third-quarter adjusted gross margin was 54%. AMD said it now believes its total addressable AI market could be over $1 trillion by 2030, up from a previous target of $500 billion by 2028. The jump in AMD's stock price Wednesday could point to growing investor optimism in opportunities for the chipmaker, long seen as occupying a distant second place to AI chip leader Nvidia. Several Wall Street analysts said they remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock following the event, though they declined to raise their price targets amid persistent worries about an AI bubble and the possibility that AMD's upward momentum could reverse course if it pops. Citi analysts, who maintained a neutral rating for the shares, said they believe AMD's targets "will likely be maintained or exceeded until the AI bubble bursts but our conversations with investors indicate many are already there." "We believe the AI bubble will likely burst within a couple years and could result in much lower estimates," they wrote. Shares of AMD have roughly doubled in value in 2025 so far, with most of those gains coming in the past few months after a string of big AI deals, including one with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Title: US stocks are drifting around their records as AMD rallies

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted around their records in a mixed day of trading Wednesday. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and neared its all-time high set a couple weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 327 points, or 0.7%, to set a record for the second straight day, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Advanced Micro Devices was at the front of the market. It rallied 9% after CEO Lisa Su said the chip company is expecting better than 35% of annual compounded revenue growth over the next three to five years. She credited “accelerating AI momentum.” Stocks benefiting from the artificial-intelligence frenzy have been shaky recently, as investors question whether how much more they can add to already spectacular gains. Their sensational performances have been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and high inflation. Their prices have shot so high, though, that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. Nvidia came into the day with a 4.6% drop for the month so far, for example, after its stock price more than doubled in four of the last five years. The biggest player in AI chips swung between gains and losses throughout Wednesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 3.6% for one of the day’s larger losses in the S&P 500. Similar questions about priciness are dogging the rest of the U.S. market, though not as pointedly as for Big Tech and AI superstars. One way for stock prices to look less expensive is for companies to deliver big growth in profits. On Holdings jumped 18% after the Swiss shoe and apparel company reported a much bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It reported growth in sales from around the world, with the strongest coming from Asia. But even beating expectations may not be enough for some stocks. Circle Internet Group fell 12.2% even though it reported profit for the latest quarter that trounced analysts’ estimates. The issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies has seen its stock price fall since it got near $300 in June, just a few weeks after its initial price offering of $31. It’s now below $87. All told, the S&P 500 rose 4.31 points to 6,850.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 326.86 to 48,254.82, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 61.84 to 23,406.46. Another way for stock prices to look less expensive is if interest rates fall. That’s because bonds paying lower yields can encourage investors to pay higher prices for other kinds of investments. In the U.S. bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.06% from 4.13% late Monday after trading resumed following Tuesday’s Veterans Day holiday. Traders still see a nearly 2-in-3 chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. That’s despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a third cut for the year is far from a sure thing. Fed officials are worried about the potential of giving still-high inflation more fuel. The Fed has been in a difficult spot recently because the U.S. government has not been publishing its usual updates on the job market, inflation and other areas of the economy. That’s restricted its view of how things are going, though the nation’s longest-ever shutdown appears to be nearing an end. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia. Germany’s DAX returned 1.2%, and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.1% for two of the world’s bigger gains. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: From Product Manager to Entrepreneur: The Grit, Grind, and Growth Behind the Title

Leaving a steady role at a company like American Express to start your own AI consulting firm sounds glamorous… until you realize just how much grit it takes to turn that vision into revenue. In a recent episode of Productside Stories, I sat down with Cooper Craig, a former product manager who traded enterprise decks for small-business deals and built a thriving AI agency from the ground up. His story (and his scars) reveal what it really takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur in 2025’s AI-charged economy. The timing isn’t accidental. 2025 has seen a wave of experienced product managers exploring entrepreneurship. Some are leaving big tech; others are launching AI automation consultancies, productized services, or indie SaaS tools. What’s driving the shift? Cooper’s journey from product manager to entrepreneur captures all three forces colliding at once. After being laid off from Amex in 2024, he found himself doing gig work to stay afloat — until he decided to build something of his own: Smartify AI, a consulting agency helping small and mid-sized businesses automate workflows and customer engagement with AI tools. What surprised Cooper most wasn’t the leap into entrepreneurship. It was how prepared he already was. “My product background is definitely my secret sauce,” he explained. “When a client comes to me saying, ‘I want AI to do this, this, and that,’ I can see through the noise. I know how to frame a problem, validate it, and build iteratively instead of over-engineering.” Every skill that makes PMs effective in organizations (discovery, prioritization, customer empathy, hypothesis testing) becomes an unfair advantage when building your own business. That combination is exactly what makes going from product manager to entrepreneur not just possible, but powerful. Cooper’s story isn’t a LinkedIn success reel. It’s a crash course in humility. When he was first laid off, he admits, “I felt like a failure. I’d been a PM for nearly 10 years and suddenly I was driving Uber to make ends meet.” That raw honesty resonated with product leaders everywhere. The truth is, the from product manager to entrepreneur journey almost always starts with uncertainty, not funding. Many PMs are wired for systems and predictability; entrepreneurship is the opposite. Cooper leaned on what PMs do best: structured learning. He spent a month immersing himself in no-code tools like Make.com and n8n, experimenting with automation workflows, voice agents, and AI assistants. Then, he landed his first client, a startup building the “GolfNow of pickleball.” From there, referrals snowballed. His key lesson? Momentum compounds faster than confidence. Build something small, ship it, and let outcomes rebuild belief. Ask any founder and they’ll tell you, getting clients is one thing, keeping up with them is another. Even after Smartify AI crossed $30K MRR, Cooper found himself trapped in the classic founder paradox: “I needed to hire help to grow, but I couldn’t hire until I grew.” The grind of going from product manager to entrepreneur often comes down to managing three overlapping systems: This is where experienced PMs have an edge. We know how to systematize, prioritize, and measure what matters. But make no mistake: founder life replaces Jira tickets with invoices, and stakeholder meetings with late-night problem-solving. Once you’ve survived the first year, something shifts. The same frameworks PMs use to guide product growth now guide business growth. Cooper uses his own version of a product roadmap to track his company’s milestones. Weekly sprints? Still there. Retrospectives? Absolutely. Only now, the “users” are clients, the “features” are services, and the “product” is the business itself. As AI consulting matures, he’s turning Smartify AI’s internal playbooks (like his VoiceMail Pro voice agent) into standalone products. That’s where the from product manager to entrepreneur evolution comes full circle: from managing someone else’s roadmap to owning your own. And for product leaders reading this, that’s the deeper takeaway: you already have the mindset, frameworks, and rigor of a founder. What you might lack is permission to start. If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to go from product manager to entrepreneur, Cooper’s advice is deceptively simple: Join our newsletter and stay up to date with all things current and Product Management related. © 2025 Productside.

Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. AI continues to ripple through the corporate world, with bosses eager to boost productivity and workers equally eager for tools that make their jobs easier. But as many AI pilots flop, the demand for employees who can actually apply the technology effectively has never been higher. That’s why Cisco is leaning on its workforce rather than cutting it. Unlike peers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Accenture—who have trimmed staff—Cisco is investing in skilling up the employees it already has. “I don’t want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,” CEO Chuck Robbins said to CNBC in August. “I don’t want to get rid of engineers. I just want our engineers we have today to innovate faster and be more productive.” In practice, that’s meant in part giving developers access to AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. Already, about 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log in to AI coding tools at least once a month, and nearly a quarter of the company’s code is AI-generated—up from just 4% a year ago, according to Fletcher Previn, Cisco’s chief information officer. Internally, Cisco leaders are expected to pursue AI learning, in part because employees whose managers use AI are twice as likely to adopt it themselves, Scott McGuckin, Cisco’s global head of talent acquisition, told Fortune. And for those who do embrace the technology, the benefits are obvious. “While I haven’t placed any mandatory AI training on my immediate team, I highly expect them to be taking advantage of the AI tools and courses available in the company,” McGuckin said. “Those who do, show me their creativity, productivity, and strategic thinking.” While tech companies are expected to slow their hiring as AI makes existing roles more productive, McGuckin said the war for talent remains competitive—and AI adoption is a top market differentiator. “For technical hires today, we look for relevant coding and engineering skills, which vary. Some of our coveted AI skill sets lie in AI and machine learning foundations and data science. Having these hard skills are a baseline to most applied roles,” he added. When push comes to shove, what really moves the needle in the hiring process is showing knowledge of AI in context, like responsible AI, ethics in bias detection, and explainability, McGuckin said. But for entry-level talent, that doesn’t mean you even need a degree. Demonstrating skills through coursework, research, or independent projects is often enough. In fiscal year 2023, 30% of Cisco’s entry-level hires were degreeless—something the company plans to expand upon. Cisco’s efforts are part of an industrywide movement to upskill workers for the AI era. In a recent report from the AI Workforce Consortium—led by Cisco and joined by Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP—it was found that seven out of 10 of the fastest-growing information and communications technology jobs were AI-related. The group also published a catalog of nearly 250 learning recommendations and an AI skills glossary to help workers navigate how to stay competitive in their field. Still, AI’s arrival hasn’t been without headaches. The hiring process has been infiltrated by fake candidates, often tied to North Korea. One report found that the number of companies that hired North Korean software developers grew a staggering 220% in the past year. Broadly speaking, McGuckin said Cisco has made vigilance a priority, increasing verification steps during the hiring process, including enhanced background checks that may involve an in-person component. “We want to assure all our applicants that there’s nothing they need to do differently when applying through Cisco’s talent portal—they are not losing out to fake candidates,” he said. “We feel the onus is on us, or employers at large, to create a safe and trustworthy candidate experience.” For Cisco, the challenge is straightforward: keep pace with AI’s rapid acceleration while making sure the people building it are both skilled—and real. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Tariffs could be coming for your Christmas tree

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Forget the Grinch — this year, it’s tariffs that could try to steal the Christmas tree. Artificial Christmas trees will cost an estimated 10% to 20% more this season than they did last year because of increased tariff costs, according to several major U.S. importers. And the cost of lights could jump as much as 63% for the same reason. Mass market Christmas decor has not been manufactured in the United States for decades. If vendors were to try to make it domestically, the mere cost of moving the manufacturing operations would be prohibitive — let alone actually producing the trees. Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of artificial tree vendor Balsam Hill, estimates that if he were to manufacture Christmas trees in the U.S., the price of an $800 tree would skyrocket to around $3,000. “When we make Christmas trees, some of the equipment is the size of a U.S. football field,” he told NBC News in an interview. "There’s a ton of capital that’s invested in these factories, and the equipment’s so big you can’t even pick it up and put it on a container [ship] and transport it," he said. Moreover, the most popular artificial option, prelit trees, are a very labor intensive project, Harman said. The lights are often strung by hand, a job that American factories have neither the manpower nor the budgets to undertake. “There are over 20,000 people in China that manufacture Christmas trees. Many of those people are the ones that are experts in stringing the lights, and they’ve done it for a long time. They’re very fast at it. They’re good at it,” he said. Harman described how the U.S. export Christmas decor business first took off in Thailand in the 1990s, before moving to China over time. Now, he estimates, around 90% of mass market Christmas decor products are made in China. But that could be changing. Following Trump's election last November, Harman tried to diversify Balsam Hill’s supply chain because he anticipated the president would follow through with China tariffs after he had spent months campaigning on them. As a result of those diversification efforts, Harman said, during this Christmas season, around a third of Balsam Hill's trees will come from outside of China. Balsam Hill also tried to blunt tariff-related price pressures this year by importing the bulk of its inventory ahead of Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement in April. But the administration's constant back-and-forth since then on China tariff rates — from a low of 30% at one point all the way up to 145% — proved too unpredictable for Harman to effectively execute the pricing plan he had initially wanted to. “Unfortunately, most of these trees [this year] have come into the industry at 20% or 30% tariffs. So those costs do add up,” he said. The overall supply of artificial trees will also take a hit this year, he said, after vendors opted to import fewer trees to offset the higher tariff costs. Harman said he expects the industry to stock 15% fewer artificial trees this season, potentially leading to fewer options for those who tree shop later in the season. Balsam Hill is not alone in paring back its Christmas decor imports during this year of outsized tariff impacts. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said on the company’s September quarterly earnings call that the big-box discounter had “really thinned down that whole category" of discretionary Christmas items such as toys and decor this year. Yet, in spite of the broader tariff pressures and stubbornly low consumer sentiment, the National Retail Federation forecasts that U.S. holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion this year for the first time. According to a recent National Retail Federation survey, the average consumer plans to spend around $270 on non-gift holiday items like decor and cards this season. One place that tariffs don't seem poised to bite American consumers this Christmas is in the live tree category. The vast majority of live trees that are sold stateside are grown in the U.S. But even those grown in Canada will be tariff-free this year under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. This comes even as the Trump administration enacts a 45% duty on Canadian lumber entering the U.S. According to the Real Christmas Tree Board, a live tree industry group, 84% of the wholesale Christmas tree growers it surveyed recently said they do not plan to increase prices this year. “We’re one of those few products where we can say, 'Hey, we don’t have to worry about that,'” Marsha Gray, the board’s executive director, told NBC News. And given that live Christmas trees take about 10 years to grow to market size, current economic factors like tariffs are not poised to impact supply in the next few years. “We’re at a point right now where we just have a really, really strong inventory, the strongest inventory I’ve seen in over a decade,” Gray said. No matter what type of Christmas tree people choose, the National Retail Federation says that while consumers may be slightly more cautious this year about shopping, they’re also more prepared. “Somehow, every year, Santa Claus always comes, and I think that really captures the way the holiday season goes,” federation President and CEO Matthew Shay wrote in the group's holiday forecast. “People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it.” Maya Huter is an associate producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

IBM's chief scientist has advice for recent grads hoping to land a software engineering job: Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after. "Don't just go for the standard 'I'm going to go and work for Google, Microsoft, IBM,'" Ruchir Puri told Business Insider. Puri, who has spent over three decades at IBM, said that as AI reshapes every industry, software engineers are needed across all sectors — whether that's transportation, manufacturing, or retail. He said job seekers should widen their search "beyond a narrow set of technology companies" and also consider the "massive enterprise landscape." For example, a company like John Deere, the world's largest agricultural equipment manufacturer, may not be top of mind for a software engineer looking for a job. However, Puri said the company is a household name, making a measurable impact. Other similar companies are hiring software engineers to help drive industry transformation, and being a part of that work can feel fulfilling, he said. "You are impacting something that is fundamental to global economy — and it's not just about technology," Puri said. Puri's comments come as IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said in a CNBC interview that the company planned to increase hiring among recent college graduates over the next year. However, new graduates are generally entering a challenging market. An August Handshake report found that job postings on the platform decreased by over 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, competition soared, with the average number of applications per job up by 26% year-over-year. Software engineering in general has undergone a shake-up in recent years. A saturated talent pool paired with rapid AI adoption has created an environment of uncertainty in hiring. While the tech industry is investing heavily in AI development, companies in the sector have also conducted consistent layoffs over the past few years. Giants like Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon all made cuts in 2025. Earlier this month, IBM announced it would cut thousands of workers in the fourth quarter, impacting a "single-digit percentage of its global workforce," a spokesperson told Business Insider. Krishna said in the CNBC interview that the company is shifting priorities to hire more people around AI and quantum. Puri said that now is a good time for entry-level candidates to expand their view when it comes to finding meaningful work. "The world is your oyster," Puri said. "There are lots of companies in the world. All of them are looking to transform themselves with AI." Are you struggling to find a software engineering job? We want to hear from you.

Title: Ethereum Is ‘Infrastructure for Wall Street.’ Could $PEPENODE Be the Next Beneficiary?

Quick Facts: Ethereum’s ($ETH) reputation as crypto’s settlement layer just got a major institutional stamp. Former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom argued that Ethereum isn’t merely another blockchain; it’s the ‘infrastructure’ Wall Street can actually build on in an interview with CoinDesk. His case rests on the three things TradFi will not compromise on: liquidity, security, and trust that lets compliance teams sleep at night. And Chalom is putting his thoughts into action over at SharpLink. The staking of billions of dollars’ worth of Ether validates $ETH’s role as the foundational layer for the future of finance. That framing hits differently in late 2025, especially if you believe what BlackRock CEO Larry Fink thinks of tokenization being the next generation for markets, something he has touted since 2022. For traders watching risk rotations, that institutional endorsement often kick-starts a familiar second-order trade: attention and flows migrate toward $ETH-aligned narratives and apps that feel built for scale, such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE). PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is a project aiming to build an Ethereum-based ‘mine-to-earn’ ecosystem with a gamified staking model. In a market hunting for a solid premise tied to real utility, a memecoin that anchors incentives to Ethereum’s trust layer is sure to attract investors. Overall, its pitch is simple: take the dopamine of mining, strip out the hardware, and plug it into Ethereum’s security and tooling. You’ll start off with an empty virtual server room. From here, you’ll be able to buy your first node, which you can then combine with other nodes, which helps boost your mining output. Rather than combining nodes at random, you’ll need to have a bit of strategy. That’s because a certain combination of these nodes will have an impact on your performance. Get it right and you’ll get a higher yield. You’ll have a dashboard where you can track your progress, including your hashrate, energy, and rewards. All in all, you’ll get a taste of crypto mining without building and maintaining an expensive rig all by yourself. After the TGE, staking, node utility, and a leaderboard system will also go live. As a participant, you’ll be encouraged to continue optimizing your setup, as doing so helps you generate more coins, including exclusive $PEPENODE boosts and some of the best meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. While none of this guarantees price performance, the mix of gamified progression, measurable on-chain actions, and $ETH’s credibility gives PEPENODE a shot at stronger retention than the average meme coin. Due to these factors, we believe the token has the potential to reach a high of $0.0072 by the end of 2026, a 528.6% increase according to our PEPENODE price prediction. At the moment, the PEPENODE presale continues to gain traction, having raised over $2.12M to date. You can still buy its native $PEPENODE tokens for $0.0011454 each, which you can claim after the presale or stake to earn 609% APY. When staking, it’s worth noting that the rewards rate will change as more tokens are added to the staking pool. As with most token presales, PEPENODE features regular price increases. Because of this, the rule of thumb is to always act as quickly as possible so you can lock in tokens at the best possible price at the moment. There are two days left before the next price increase in this ongoing presale, so hurry. Join the PEPENODE presale today.

Title: Offline and online coupled tensor factorization with knowledge graph
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0336100

How can we accurately decompose a temporal irregular tensor along while incorporating a related knowledge graph tensor in both offline and online streaming settings? PARAFAC2 decomposition is widely applied to the analysis of irregular tensors consisting of matrices with varying row sizes. In both offline and online streaming scenarios, existing PARAFAC2 methods primarily focus on capturing dynamic features that evolve over time, since data irregularities often arise from temporal variations. However, these methods tend to overlook static features, such as knowledge-based information, which remain unchanged over time. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF (Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization) and OKG-CTF (Online Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), two coupled tensor factorization methods designed to effectively capture both dynamic and static features within an irregular tensor in offline and online streaming settings, respectively. To integrate knowledge graph tensors as static features, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF couple an irregular temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing a common axis. Additionally, both methods employ relational regularization to preserve the structural dependencies among the factor matrices of the knowledge graph tensor. To further enhance convergence speed, we utilize momentum-based update strategies for factor matrices. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KG-CTF reduces error rates by up to 1.64× compared to existing PARAFAC2 methods. Furthermore, OKG-CTF achieves up to 5.7× faster running times compared to existing streaming approaches for each newly arriving tensor.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Given a temporal irregular tensor and a knowledge graph tensor, how can we accurately decompose these tensors to derive meaningful latent factors? Many real-world datasets are represented as irregular tensors such as stock data, traffic data, and music data. An irregular tensor consists of matrices with varying row sizes, while the column sizes remain fixed. For example, in stock data, each matrix corresponds to a specific stock, where the number of rows varies based on different time periods, but the columns represent common stock features such as opening price, closing price, and trading volume. Large-scale factual information is effectively organized into a knowledge graph, which represents information through entities and the relationships between them. A knowledge graph is structured as a graph-based database that represents information in the form of triples (es, r, eo), where the subject (head) entity es is connected to the object (tail) entity eo through the relation r. A knowledge graph can be modeled as a third-order binary array in tensor form, where each entry represents a triplet, with a value of 1 indicating a known fact and 0 representing an unknown or missing fact. Various tensor decomposition methods for knowledge graphs [1–5] have been developed to capture hidden relational patterns and improve the accuracy of missing information prediction. Many tensor decomposition methods [6–12] have been proposed to extract patterns from high-dimensional data. Recently, there has been much attention on PARAFAC2 decomposition [13–17] in order to analyze irregular tensors. These approaches [14,16] primarily employ the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, incorporating various optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency of updates. However, many existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods have significant limitations. First, they emphasize modeling temporal dynamic features (e.g., daily stock prices and trading volumes), which leads to neglecting static features (e.g., a company’s sector) that remain unchanged over time in the tensor. Both dynamic and static features are equally crucial for the accurate modeling of factor matrices. Second, incorporating static features into the existing PARAFAC2 decomposition method [14,18] often introduces a significant bias toward the temporal features, ultimately failing to explicitly model auxiliary information. TASTE [19] incorporates both dynamic and static features through coupled matrix and tensor factorization; however, it fails to represent static features as high-dimensional data, potentially resulting in information loss. Third, while existing PARAFAC2-based decomposition methods [15,20] introduce additional regularization terms to incorporate information from multiple sources, these terms often hinder convergence during the learning process. Therefore, the major challenges to be addressed are: 1) how to effectively integrate dynamic and static information in irregular tensors, 2) how to accurately capture patterns within static information, and 3) how to develop an update rule for stable convergence. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, two accurate coupled tensor factorization methods to integrate dynamic and static information in irregular tensors by leveraging knowledge graphs. KG-CTF runs in an offline setting, while OKG-CTF is designed for an online streaming setting. The main ideas of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF are as follows: 1) integrate a temporal irregular tensor with a knowledge graph tensor to model both dynamic and static features, 2) introduce an effective regularization that captures the relationships within the factor matrices of the knowledge graph, and then 3) ensure stable and fast convergence of the complex loss function through a momentum-based ALS update mechanism. Furthermore, in an online streaming setting, OKG-CTF efficiently deals with newly incoming tensors by avoiding direct computations on the entire tensor, instead leveraging only the new data and updated factor matrices. Experimental results show that KG-CTF and OKG-CTF outperform existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods in missing value prediction tasks, achieving superior accuracy in both offline and online settings. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/snudatalab/KG-CTF. In this section, we explain preliminaries of irregular tensor notations, PARAFAC2 decomposition, and knowledge graph, followed by the problem definitions. Table 1 summarizes the symbols used throughout the paper. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t001 An irregular tensor is denoted as , consisting of a collection of slice matrices, where each slice represents the k-th matrix, and K is the total number of slices. Note that the row size Ik varies across slice matrices, while the column size J remains the same for all. PARAFAC2 decomposition [21] has been widely used for analyzing irregular tensors. Given each k-th slice matrix of an irregular tensor , PARAFAC2 decomposes each slice into three matrices: , , and V, as illustrated in Fig 1. This decomposition is formulated as , where is an matrix, is an diagonal matrix, and V is a matrix shared across all slices with R as the target rank. PARAFAC2 converts each slice matrix into , , and for , where is a diagonal matrix. PARAFAC2 converts each slice matrix into , , and for , where is a diagonal matrix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g001 The objective function of the PARAFAC2 decomposition is formulated as follows: where represents the Frobenius norm of matrix X, defined as , with denoting the (i,j)-th element of matrix X. To ensure the uniqueness of the solution, several studies [22,23] reformulate with , where is a column-orthogonal matrix, and is a shared matrix across all slices. A knowledge graph is a collection of triplets that encode facts through entities and their relationships, denoted as . Specifically, each triplet (h,r,t) captures the semantic connection between a head entity h and a tail entity t through the relationship r. For example, the triplet represents the relationship between the book Harry Potter (head entity) and the author J.K. Rowling (tail entity) through the relation Written by in the context of book knowledge. Similarly, in the context of travel, indicates that Central Park (head entity) is related to New York City (tail entity) via the relation Located in. This structured representation of a knowledge graph facilitates the efficient integration of large-scale factual information, serving as additional contextual data. A knowledge graph is expressed as a three-dimensional tensor , which takes the form of either a regular or an irregular tensor. In this paper, we represent the knowledge graph as an irregular tensor , where each is an item-specific slice matrix that forms an (entity-relation) matrix, with rows corresponding to item-related entities and columns representing relations. A more detailed explanation of this representation is provided later in this paper. We define the problems of coupled tensor factorization with knowledge graph in offline and online streaming settings as follows: Problem 1 (Coupled Tensor Factorization with Knowledge Graph). Given. Find. Factor matrices , , , and for , and common factor matrices , , and with R as the target rank, where each k-th slice matrix of the temporal irregular tensor is approximated by , each k-th slice matrix of the knowledge graph tensor by , and each temporal factor matrix by . Problem 2 (Online Coupled Tensor Factorization with Knowledge Graph). Given. Find. Factor matrices , , , and for , and common factor matrices , , and for the entire tensor and where; denotes the vertical concatenation of matrices, old rows of k-th existing slice matrix are approximated by , and new rows of k-th existing slice matrix are approximated by . Each temporal factor matrix is approximated by , by , and each k-th slice matrix of the knowledge graph tensor by . We propose KG-CTF (Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), an accurate coupled tensor factorization method designed to effectively capture both dynamic and static features in irregular tensors. KG-CTF tackles the following challenges to achieve accurate coupled tensor factorization. To address these challenges, we propose the following key ideas (see Fig 2): (a) We introduce a method that couples a temporal tensor with a Knowledge Graph (KG) tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This coupling allows the factor matrices to jointly learn both temporal and static features within an irregular tensor. (b) Relational regularization captures the relationship between the factor matrices derived from the KG tensor, improving their interpretability. (c) To ensure consistent entity representations across all slices, we initialize the entity factor matrix with the updated entity embeddings from . This approach maintains coherence in entity factors across slices, promoting stable learning. (d) We apply a momentum update strategy to ensure faster and stable convergence for factor matrices. At each iteration t, the momentum update refines the current ALS update step for by incorporating the update direction from , leading to a more efficient final update step for .

To capture dynamic information, we leverage the temporally irregular tensor . As described in Eq (1), each slice matrix is factorized using the PARAFAC2 decomposition with a target rank R, yielding three factor matrices: , , and . For example, in stock data analysis, represents the time factor matrix, corresponds to the stock-specific factor matrix, and V serves as the shared stock feature matrix. The loss function designed to capture this dynamic information is formulated as follows: Next, we introduce the knowledge graph tensor as a source of static information and integrate it with the existing temporally irregular tensor . To effectively model the knowledge graph, we represent it as an irregular tensor for two key reasons. First, the number of entities associated with each item varies, inherently resulting in an irregular tensor structure. Second, the conventional entity-relation-entity representation of knowledge graphs leads to exceedingly large and sparse entity factor matrices due to the vast number of entities involved. If the entity factor matrix was constructed using the complete set of entities, the resulting tensor would be highly sparse, making an irregular tensor representation a more effective alternative. To construct this irregular tensor for knowledge graph, we define a slice matrix for each item k, where rows correspond to entities linked to k-th item and columns represent all relation types. Specifically, each matrix is derived from knowledge graph triplets (h,r,t), where the tail entity t denotes the k-th item, the head entity h is an entity associated with that item, and r is the relation type. The (i,j)-th entry of is set to 1 if the i-th entity is connected to item k via the j-th relation, and 0 otherwise. For example, in a stock-related knowledge graph, each item corresponds to a specific stock, with representing its entity–relation matrix for each stock. Triplets such as and indicate that the stock Apple is linked to entities California and IT via the relations located in and industry of, respectively. Accordingly, in for Apple, the row for California has a 1 in the located in column, and the row for IT has a 1 in the industry of column. Therefore, we define the knowledge graph tensor as , where each slice matrix (representing entity-relation interactions for an item) is factorized into three components: , , and . Here, is the entity factor matrix, is the item-specific factor matrix, and R is the relation factor matrix. In this notation, Nk denotes the number of entities linked to the k-th item, L represents the total number of relation types, and R is the target rank. For stock datasets, is decomposed into , , and R, representing entity-specific features related to each stock, stock-level latent factors, and the relation factor matrix shared across all stocks, respectively. Therefore, the loss function for the learning of static information is formulated as follows: To ensure consistent entity representations across different slices and mitigate the inconsistencies that arise from independently decomposing each slice in PARAFAC2, we introduce a shared entity factor matrix approach. As shown in Fig 2(c), the embedding of an entity remains the same across all slices, preserving its representation throughout the decomposition process. For each slice k, the entity factor matrix is initialized using the following strategy: (1) If an entity has appeared in previous slices, its embedding is inherited from the corresponding entity factors in , (2) otherwise, its embedding is randomly initialized. This iterative approach ensures the stability of entity representations while also enhancing their interpretability across slices. Finally, we couple the knowledge graph tensor with the temporal irregular tensor by sharing the common axis . Since is a diagonal matrix that encodes slice-specific information, sharing it allows for simultaneous learning of the dynamic characteristics from the temporal tensor and the static properties embedded in the knowledge graph tensor. Furthermore, unlike other factor matrices (e.g., , V, , or R) that are domain-specific, represents item-level latent factors. Therefore, sharing this static matrix , which is unaffected by temporal dynamics, ensures interpretability while avoiding conflicts between modalities. The overall loss function that couples these two tensors is formulated as follows: We add effective regularizations to the loss function. We introduce a relational regularization term to ensure that the factor matrices obtained from the knowledge graph tensor effectively encode relational structures. Existing methods [24–26] struggle to fully capture the intricate relational dependencies present in knowledge graphs, largely because they overlook the directional nature of these relationships. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate a regularization term that explicitly models the triple structure of the knowledge graph, thereby improving the representation of directional relationships. Based on the approach proposed in [27], we assume that each knowledge graph triplet (h,r,t) satisfies the condition , where h, r, and t correspond to the vector representations of the head entity, relation, and tail entity, respectively. Here, the norm represents the Euclidean distance, enforcing relational consistency within the knowledge graph. For instance, in a stock-related knowledge graph, if the head entity is iPhone, the relation is produced by, and the tail entity is Apple Inc., the relationship is captured by ensuring that remains close to zero. To effectively learn these relational dependencies, we decompose each knowledge graph slice into three factor matrices. The entity factor matrix represents the head entities, the relation factor matrix captures relational properties, and the item factor matrix serves as the representation of the tail entities. To handle cases where an item is connected to multiple entities through the same relation, the regularization term is minimized using the least squares method. For instance, if an item i1 is linked to entities e2 and e3 through relation r1, the objective is to minimize . Given that e2 and e3 are fixed, this can be equivalently rewritten as minimizing . Here, represents the average embedding of e2 and e3. Thus, to incorporate this principle, we define the relational regularization term as follows: where is the diagonal degree matrix associated with , and the (l,l)-th element of corresponds to the number of entities connected to the l-th relation (i.e., the sum of the elements in the l-th column of ). Additionally, is a matrix filled with ones. represents the tail, meaning the embedding of the k-th item padded L times. The matrix represents the relation factor, while represents the head, computed as the average embedding of entities linked by the same relation. Here, represents the embeddings of the Nk entities connected to the k-th item. The product yields a matrix where the l-th row contains the sum of embeddings of entities linked to k-th item through relation l. By applying , we normalize this sum by the number of entities per relation, so that the l-th row of corresponds to the average embedding of entities connected to k-th item via relation l. To further illustrate how the relational regularization term operates, we provide an example in Fig 3. This figure illustrates a case where a head stock h is connected to three entities via four relation types, resulting in a slice matrix . The regularization encourages the tail embedding of stock h, repeated four times as , to be aligned with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head entity embeddings associated with each relation, computed as . This alignment reduces inconsistency between the stock embedding and its relational context in the knowledge graph, resulting in more semantically coherent representations across domains. Given four relation types and three entities connected to stock h, the slice matrix encodes binary connections between entities and relations. The relational regularization term aligns the tail embeddings of stock h with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head embeddings computed over entities connected to stock h per relation. Given four relation types and three entities connected to stock h, the slice matrix encodes binary connections between entities and relations. The relational regularization term aligns the tail embeddings of stock h with the sum of the relation embeddings and the average head embeddings computed over entities connected to stock h per relation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g003 To enhance the interpretability of the factor matrices while preserving accuracy, we employ uniqueness regularization by reformulating as , as established in previous studies [22,23], where is a column-orthogonal matrix. This approach mitigates the issue of arbitrary rotations in factor matrices, ensuring that remains unique, up to scaling and permutation. To enforce this constraint, we incorporate the following regularization terms into Eq (1): where is a hyperparameter to control the effect of uniqueness for . We apply L2 regularization to the factor matrices , , V, and R to mitigate overfitting and enhance numerical stability throughout the optimization process: We define the following loss function , incorporating effective regularization terms: Algorithm 1 KG-CTF with momentum-based ALS.

By incorporating a fraction of the prior update direction into the newly computed factor matrix, the algorithm achieves more stable and faster factor updates. For the factor matrix , let denote its value at iteration t. After performing the standard ALS update to compute , the update is further refined by incorporating a momentum term: where β is the momentum coefficient, typically ranging between 0 and 1. During the initial iterations (e.g., t < 5), β is set to zero to allow the algorithm to stabilize without the influence of previous updates. In subsequent iterations, the momentum coefficient β is assigned a positive value to integrate a portion of the previous update direction into the current update, thus accelerating convergence and enhancing optimization efficiency. By incorporating this momentum mechanism, the ALS algorithm improves its ability to process high-dimensional data, ultimately achieving faster and more stable convergence. Algorithm 1 presents an overview of the proposed Momentum-ALS algorithm. The algorithm starts with the random initialization of the factor matrices, followed by iterative ALS updates. For each slice k, the factor matrices are initially updated using the standard ALS procedure, and a momentum term is subsequently applied to refine the final update. We use an alternating optimization-based update procedure, where each factor matrix is updated independently while keeping the other factor matrices fixed. Updating . We update by setting and rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 1. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for minimizes (Eq (2)): □ Proof: See Appendix. □ Updating . To update , we first transform for k = 1...K into whose k-th row contains the diagonal elements of (i.e., ). Then, we update by setting and rearranging the term based on the loss function (Eq (2)). We update W row by row with the following lemma: Lemma 2. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the k-th row of the factor matrix which corresponds to the diagonal elements of minimizes (Eq (2)): where is a vectorization of a matrix. and * denote the Khatri-Rao product and the element-wise multiplication, respectively. is a vector filled with ones. □ Proof: See Appendix.

Lemma 5. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the factor matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (2)): □ Proof: See Appendix. Updating . We update by setting and rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 6. Solving the Sylvester equation (Eq (8)) with respect to minimizes the loss function (Eq (2)) when all other factor matrices are fixed: Note that the Sylvester equation [28] has the form , where we set to solve for . □ Proof: See Appendix. □ Updating . We update by setting and rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 7. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the factor matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (2)): □ Proof: See Appendix. □ We iteratively update the factor matrices using the update procedure in Lemmas 1 to 7. Each update is the exact closed-form ALS solution of a quadratic subproblem with all other factors fixed, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective and convergence to a stationary local minimum. We provide the time complexity of KG-CTF. Theorem 1. The time complexity of KG-CTF is given by □ Proof: See Appendix. According to Theorem 1, KG-CTF runs in time that scales linearly with the total number of tensor entries, ensuring practicality even for very large datasets. It is also noteworthy that, in most practical settings, the KG information tables are orders of magnitude smaller than the primary tensor (). Consequently, the cubic term + is asymptotically dominated by the linear term in Ik, and its contribution to the overall runtime is negligible. We propose OKG-CTF (Online Knowledge Graph-based Coupled Tensor Factorization), an accurate coupled tensor factorization method designed to handle both dynamic and static features in streaming irregular tensor data. OKG-CTF addresses the following challenges for accurate coupled tensor factorization in an online streaming setting. We address the above challenges with the following ideas (see Fig 4): We formulate a method to couple a streaming temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This enables factor matrices to jointly learn temporal and static features within an irregular tensor in an online setting. We formulate a method to couple a streaming temporal tensor with a knowledge graph tensor by sharing the diagonal matrix Sk. This enables factor matrices to jointly learn temporal and static features within an irregular tensor in an online setting. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g004 We propose a loss function designed to efficiently capture both dynamic and static features from a streaming temporal irregular tensor . The loss function in Eq (2), when applied in streaming settings, suffers from inefficiencies due to redundant computations of the accumulated tensor whenever new data are given. This highlights the need for a more effective strategy tailored for a streaming setting. Therefore, we reformulate the loss function by separating the terms related to old data from those related to new data. When new data are added to each slice matrix of the temporal irregular tensor, the loss function is defined as follows: where () is the hyperparameter controlling the effect of forgetting factor, which determines the relative importance of newly arrived data compared to older data. Specifically, we divide into and , into and , and into and . This approach ensures efficient computation by avoiding redundant operations on old data and focusing on learning from newly arrived data. The forgetting factor plays a crucial role in controlling the balance between retaining historical information and adapting to recent changes. A smaller emphasizes recent data, enabling rapid adaptation to new patterns but increasing sensitivity to short-term noise. Conversely, a larger gives greater weight to historical information, enhancing stability while slowing adaptation to distributional shifts. Thus, defines the trade-off between adaptivity and stability, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate balanced value in practice. We propose an efficient ALS update rule optimized for streaming settings, where one factor matrix is updated independently while fixing the other factor matrices. This rule eliminates the inefficiency caused by repeatedly recalculating terms involving old data whenever new data arrive, focusing on the computation of only new data. When new data are added, the loss function is divided into two parts: one for the old data and another for the new data. During the update process, terms related to old data are loaded without any recomputation, while only the terms associated with the new data are calculated. In the subsequent step, as additional new data arrive, the previously loaded old factor matrix is combined with the computed factor matrix to form the updated old factor matrix, which is then loaded in the next step. This method effectively avoids unnecessary computational growth as data accumulate, ensuring consistent efficiency over time. Algorithm 2 provides an overview of the proposed Momentum-ALS algorithm for OKG-CTF in a streaming setting. It starts by randomly initializing new factor matrices, followed by iterative ALS updates. For each slice k, all factor matrices are updated using standard ALS, with a momentum term applied to refine the final updates. The updated new factor matrices are then merged with the existing ones to update the old factor matrices for the next streaming data. Algorithm 2 OKG-CTF with momentum-based ALS.

We update by setting and then rearranging the terms with the following lemma: Lemma 8.

To update , we first transform for k = 1...K into whose k-th row contains the diagonal elements of (i.e., ). Then, we update by setting and then rearrange the term based on the loss function (Eq (10)). We update W row by row with the following lemma: Lemma 9.

When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (10)) by solving Orthogonal Procrustes problem [29] due to column-orthogonality: where is a column-orthogonal matrix (i.e., ), and and are left and right singular vector matrices of , respectively. □ Proof: See Appendix. Lemma 12. When fixing all the factor matrices except for , the following update for the factor matrix minimizes the loss function (Eq (10)): □ Proof: See Appendix. Updating and .

The update rule for to minimize (Eq (10)) is identical to defined in Lemma 7 for (Eq (2)). □ We alternatively update factor matrices with our update procedure in Lemmas 8 to 14. Each update is the exact closed-form ALS solution of a quadratic subproblem with all other factors fixed, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective and convergence to a stationary local minimum. We provide the time complexity of OKG-CTF for updating the factor matrices. Theorem 2. The time complexity of OKG-CTF is given by □ Proof: See Appendix. Theorem 2 establishes that OKG-CTF’s time cost is linear in the time length Ik,new of the newly arrived data, with as the tensor grows. This leads to significantly reduced computational cost, especially in long streaming sequences. We conduct experiments to explore the following research questions: We provide a detailed overview of our experimental setup, including datasets, baselines, task descriptions, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters. Datasets. We conduct experiments on six real-world datasets, as summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Each dataset comprises a temporal irregular tensor paired with a corresponding knowledge graph tensor. These datasets cover stock markets from the United States (S&P500, NYSE, NASDAQ), South Korea, China, and Japan. For the stock datasets, each temporal irregular tensor consists of a collection of matrices, where each matrix corresponds to an individual stock. Each slice matrix follows a (date, feature) format, with features categorized into two groups: (1) six fundamental features, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, adjusted closing price, and trading volume, and (2) 83 technical indicators derived from these fundamental features using the Technical Analysis library (https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For the knowledge graph datasets, we construct triple-based knowledge graphs covering all stocks in the six datasets using the ICKG [30] model. The StockKG dataset contains a total of 89,822 entities, including 14,019 stock entities and 15 distinct types of relations. These datasets are represented as irregular tensors in the format (entity, relation, stock), where each slice matrix is structured as (entity, relation). Here, entities denote the set of associated entities for each stock, and the dataset comprises 15 distinct relation types. # of nnz indicates the number of nonzeros. # of nnz indicates the number of nonzeros. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t002 Update cycle denotes the number of time steps between each update. Update cycle denotes the number of time steps between each update. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t003 We preprocess the real-world datasets by applying normalization methods based on their specific characteristics. For the six stock datasets, we perform z-normalization on each j-th column of the slice matrix X. In contrast, the knowledge graph tensor, consisting of binary values (0 or 1), remains unchanged without any additional normalization. Competitors. We compare KG-CTF against existing PARAFAC2 decomposition methods designed for irregular tensors: We compare OKG-CTF with existing streaming PARAFAC2 decomposition methods in an online streaming setting: Task. To evaluate the performance of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, we perform a missing value prediction task on temporal irregular tensor data. We randomly divide the data into training and test entries with the following ratios: , and . Metric. We evaluate the model performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) computed as , where Ω represents the set of test entries in the input tensor X, and denotes the reconstructed tensor obtained from the learned factor matrices. A lower RMSE score indicates better tensor decomposition accuracy. Hyperparameters. The hyperparameters for KG-CTF and OKG-CTF include the target rank R and the regularization strengths , and , along with the momentum coefficient β. We set the hyperparameters as follows: the target rank R to 5 for the China, Japan, and Korea datasets, and to 12 for the S&P500, NYSE, and NASDAQ datasets; the regularization strengths , , , and to 10, 1, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively; and the momentum coefficient β to 0.5. We compare the performance of KG-CTF with baseline models for the task of missing value prediction at test ratios ranging from 10% to 30%. According to Table 4, KG-CTF consistently achieves lower error rates across most datasets. For instance, in the Japan Stock dataset, KG-CTF shows an error rate approximately 1.64× lower than that of PARAFAC2-ALS at 10% test ratio and about 1.52× lower at 30% test ratio. Traditional methods reveal their limitations as they focus primarily on learning dynamic features while neglecting static features. In the NASDAQ, S&P500, and Korea Stock datasets, however, the performance gaps are less pronounced since KG coverage is skewed—a few stocks are linked to many entities while most have very few—so KG signals enhance a limited subset of stocks, reducing the overall benefit of coupling. In contrast, NYSE, China, and Japan Stock datasets exhibit more balanced entity coverage, allowing KG signals to be utilized more uniformly across stocks and resulting in more consistent performance improvements. Additionally, as the test ratio increases from 10% to 30%, the reliance of competing models on dynamic features causes their performance to degrade more significantly, further widening the gap with KG-CTF. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors, respectively. KG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors, respectively. KG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t004 We evaluate the performance of OKG-CTF with baselines in terms of local errors and efficiency. Local Error. We evaluate OKG-CTF’s performance by analyzing local errors, measuring the mean and standard deviation across all updates. Table 5 shows that OKG-CTF consistently achieves much lower local errors than competing models. For example, in the S&P500 dataset, OKG-CTF performs up to 1.17× better than existing models. This is because OKG-CTF learns both dynamic and static features by incorporating auxiliary information with each new data arrival, resulting in more accurate factor matrices. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. OKG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. Note that bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. OKG-CTF outperforms the competitors across all datasets and missing value ratios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.t005 Efficiency. We evaluate the performance of OKG-CTF compared to competing models in a streaming setting. In Fig 5, the running time for the N-th update represents the update time for the N-th newly arrived data, rather than cumulative time. Fig 5 presents the results for all datasets in a streaming setting where new rows of existing slice matrices arrive. OKG-CTF demonstrates superior performance, achieving up to 5.7 × faster speeds compared to traditional static PARAFAC2 decomposition methods and streaming PARAFAC2 decomposition methods. Notably, in the NYSE and S&P500 datasets, Fig 5(b) and Fig 5(c) show that OKG-CTF achieves faster updates compared to competing models. This shows that OKG-CTF maintains competitive speed performance, while combining static and dynamic features to learn richer information. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g005 Scalability for newly arrived data size. We evaluate the scalability of OKG-CTF with respect to the size of a new incoming tensor by measuring its running time. We measure execution times across five update cycles [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]. The length of new rows added to existing slice matrices increases linearly with the update cycle. As shown in Fig 6, the results are presented using box plots: the orange line marks the median, the box covers the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles, and the horizontal lines represent and . Fig 6 clearly shows that, in the setting where only new rows are added to existing slice matrices, the execution time of OKG-CTF scales linearly with the update cycle. The size of new rows of existing slice matrices is linearly proportional to an update cycle. The size of new rows of existing slice matrices is linearly proportional to an update cycle. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g006 We conduct an ablation study to evaluate how relationship learning from the knowledge graph and accelerated learning via momentum updates affect prediction accuracy for both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. Table 6 provides the global error results for KG-CTF under 20% missing-value test ratio, while Table 7 reports the local error results for OKG-CTF under 30% test ratio. For each method, we consider three reduced variants: (i) KG-CTF-R and OKG-CTF-R, which omit the relational regularization derived from the knowledge graph; (ii) KG-CTF-M and OKG-CTF-M, which exclude the momentum updates; (iii) KG-CTF-RM and OKG-CTF-RM, which remove both components and thus resemble traditional CTF-ALS. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF consistently show the lowest prediction errors, confirming that incorporating both relational information and momentum updates leads to superior performance. Even though KG-CTF-R and OKG-CTF-R lose some predictive accuracy by excluding knowledge graph relationships, they still outperform their respective -RM variants. Likewise, KG-CTF-M and OKG-CTF-M underscore the benefit of momentum updates, since their performance degrades relative to the full models. These results collectively demonstrate that our models effectively exploit both static relational structure and dynamic temporal information, allowing them to learn more accurate factor matrices for irregular time-evolving tensors. -R and -M indicate the elimination of relational regularization and no momentum update, respectively. Bold and underlined fonts indicate the lowest and second-lowest errors. Note that both the relational regularization and momentum update contribute to improving the prediction accuracy. -R and -M indicate the elimination of relational regularization and no momentum update, respectively.

Our experiments test four target rank values R of [3, 6, 9, 12], five relational regularization hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five uniqueness hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five L2 regularization hyperparameters of [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100], five forgetting factor hyperparameters of [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], and five momentum coefficients β of [0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]. We use the S&P500 (SP) and NASDAQ (ND) datasets to illustrate KG-CTF’s performance (see Fig 7), and the China Stock (CHN) and Korea Stock (KOR) datasets to examine OKG-CTF (see Fig 8). Note that SP stands for S&P500 and ND stands for NASDAQ.

Note that CHN stands for China Stock and KOR stands for Korea Stock. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.g008 Rank. We evaluate KG-CTF’s performance on S&P500 and NASDAQ datasets across four target rank values (3, 6, 9, 12). As shown in Fig 7(a) and 7(e), the prediction errors steadily decrease as the target rank increases, reaching their lowest at the highest rank R = 12. These results show that larger rank values consistently yield lower prediction errors, confirming that a higher rank helps capture more complex patterns in the data and improves accuracy. Relational pattern. Both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF incorporate relational regularization derived from a knowledge graph. For KG-CTF, Fig 7(b) and 7(f) illustrate the influence of learning relationships from the knowledge graph for the NASDAQ and S&P500 datasets. Specifically, for the NASDAQ dataset, value of 1 achieves lower errors compared to smaller values such as 0.1 or 0.01. In contrast, the S&P500 dataset performs better with smaller values. This difference arises because the NASDAQ dataset contains a larger number of entities, allowing the model to effectively leverage richer relational patterns. However, excessively large values of can lead to overfitting, particularly on datasets with fewer entities like S&P500, causing the model to learn noise rather than meaningful relational structures. A similar pattern appears for OKG-CTF in Fig 8(b) and 8(f). On both the China and Korea Stock datasets, moderate value of (around 1) produces optimal performance, confirming the importance of appropriately tuning relational regularization to avoid overfitting. Uniqueness. We assess the impact of uniqueness regularization on the performance of KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. In both KG-CTF (Fig 7(c), 7(g)) and OKG-CTF (Fig 8(c), 8(g)), we observe that an excessively large degrades performance. Although moderate helps improve the interpretability of the factor matrices, excessive regularization negatively affects the overall performance. L2. We examine how L2 regularization affects prediction performance for both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. As shown in Fig 7(d) and 7(h) (for KG-CTF), the error rates remain largely unchanged across different L2 regularization hyperparameter values. This stability arises from the normalized input tensors, which align the scales of the factor matrices, as well as from the abundant data in the KG-CTF datasets, which support accurate factor updates even without strong regularization. In contrast, Fig 8(d), 8(h) (for OKG-CTF) reveal that larger values clearly increase prediction errors. Because OKG-CTF operates on newly arrived smaller datasets, excessive L2 regularization overly constrains the model, shrinking parameter values prematurely and preventing it from capturing subtle, local patterns. Thus, while the large datasets in KG-CTF reduce sensitivity to L2 regularization, careful tuning of is necessary for OKG-CTF to balance between preventing overfitting and preserving essential information in smaller, more localized datasets. Forgetting factor. OKG-CTF explicitly includes a forgetting factor for time-evolving tensors. As illustrated in Fig 8(a) and 8(e) for the China and Korea stock datasets, excessively large values of negatively impact the prediction accuracy by overly emphasizing outdated data, while very small values discard useful historical information too quickly. In Korea stock dataset, a moderate value () achieves the best performance, balancing the short-term volatility and long-term trends inherent in stock data. Thus, selecting an intermediate value for is crucial, enabling the model to dynamically adapt to recent data trends while preserving sufficient historical context for stable and accurate predictions. Momentum coefficient. We quantitatively analyze the impact of momentum-based updates on convergence speed in both KG-CTF and OKG-CTF. We measure convergence as the first iteration (epoch) at which the RMSE drops below a dataset-specific target threshold, with lower values indicating faster convergence. As shown in Fig 9, increasing the momentum coefficient β generally leads to faster convergence across the NASDAQ, NYSE, and S&P500 datasets. For example, in NASDAQ, the model with reaches the target RMSE within just 9 iterations, whereas the baseline without momentum () requires 49 iterations—indicating a 40-iteration improvement. This result highlights that the momentum mechanism becomes particularly effective in high-dimensional, large-scale datasets. However, in the S&P500 dataset, excessively large values (e.g., ) slow down convergence or cause instability, indicating that overly strong momentum may harm training stability. Fig 10 shows similar trends in OKG-CTF. Across all datasets, consistently achieves the fastest convergence; for instance, NYSE reaches the target RMSE in only 5 iterations under this setting. By contrast, higher momentum values ( or 0.9) result in slower convergence and degraded final performance. Overall, these results confirm that moderate momentum effectively accelerates convergence, whereas excessively large values can cause oscillations and suboptimal learning.

Many studies [18,33] have introduced PARAFAC2 decomposition methods for analyzing irregular tensors. Unlike the traditional PARAFAC2-based ALS algorithm [22], RD-ALS [16] and DPar2 [14] apply preprocessing steps prior to factor matrix updates. ATOM [15] further improves the handling of temporal irregular sparse tensors, particularly those with missing values. However, they primarily focus on capturing dynamic features, while static features, which are equally crucial factors, are largely neglected. Integrating static features into the PARAFAC2 model often results in significant bias toward learning dynamic features. This limitation extends to other PARAFAC2-based approaches that do not explicitly incorporate side information. To address this, KG-CTF couples the temporal irregular tensor with the knowledge graph tensor by sharing a common axis, enabling the joint modeling of dynamic and static features while preserving the inherent relational structures among factor matrices. In online streaming settings, tensor decomposition methods [6,34,35] have been developed to efficiently update factor matrices as new data arrive. DAO-CP [9] adapts CP decomposition by detecting changes in tensor streams and selectively reusing or recomputing factor matrices. STF [7] incorporates attention-based temporal regularization to leverage past and future information for improved online learning. For irregular tensors, SPADE [31] updates factor matrices when new slices are added, while DASH [32] extends this by handling both new rows within existing slices and new slice matrices, enabling more flexible updates. However, existing methods focus on dynamic features, neglecting static features, which are equally important. A key limitation of online PARAFAC2 models is that they cannot incorporate static information in an online learning framework, as it remains unchanged over time and does not fit within their update mechanisms. While spectral regularization has been explored in neural networks and factorization models [36–38] to incorporate auxiliary structures, its use in online tensor factorization remains limited. Meanwhile, OKG-CTF effectively integrates dynamic and static features in online irregular tensor decomposition, enabling richer information learning while maintaining efficient factor matrix updates. Previous studies [39–42] have proposed Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) methods to jointly decompose tensors and matrices. HaTen2 [43] and SCouT [44] extend CMTF by implementing distributed CP-based factorization within the MAPREDUCE framework. TASTE [19] introduces a coupled irregular tensor decomposition approach for EHR data, while C3APTION [45] builds on TASTE by integrating a (non-negative) PARAFAC2 model with a (non-negative) CP model. These methods leverage complementary information to achieve data fusion, enabling the extraction of richer information through tensor decomposition. However, relying on simple matrices to represent large-scale auxiliary information has limitations, particularly in capturing intricate relationships. In contrast, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF introduce novel data fusion methods that represent knowledge graph data as irregular tensors, effectively capturing relational structures within the factor matrices. KG-CTF [39] is our preliminary work on coupled tensor factorization, designed to jointly integrate temporal irregular tensors with knowledge graph tensors. In this work, we extend KG-CTF further to effectively handle streaming irregular tensors. In this paper, we propose KG-CTF and OKG-CTF, accurate coupled tensor factorization methods that extend the traditional PARAFAC2 approaches by incorporating a knowledge graph tensor. This integration enables the modeling of both dynamic and static characteristics within temporal irregular tensors in offline and online settings, respectively. Existing methods predominantly emphasize capturing dynamic temporal features while overlooking the intricate multi-dimensional relationships embedded in the data. To address these limitations, KG-CTF and OKG-CTF incorporate relational regularization to effectively capture relational structures within the knowledge graph. Additionally, a momentum-based update strategy is employed to accelerate the factor matrix updates. Our proposed methods achieve superior performance over existing PARAFAC2-based approaches by jointly learning dynamic and static features, leading to improved accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that both methods significantly reduce error rates, establishing them as robust solutions for complex temporal irregular tensor analysis. Future work includes extending KG-CTF and OKG-CTF to a broader range of datasets and further optimizing them to enhance scalability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0336100.s001 (PDF)

November 12, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire This article has been disseminated on behalf of ESGold Corp., which may include a paid advertisement. AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: Artificial intelligence may be driven by algorithms and code, but its hardware backbone depends on gold and silver — the same precious metals that connect every chip, circuit board and data hub worldwide. Global reserves of these materials are tightening even as industrial demand accelerates, creating a structural imbalance few foresaw. Silver remains unmatched as the essential conductor embedded in photovoltaic cells and high-speed electronic networks, while gold continues to serve as the corrosion-resistant benchmark for bonding wires, connectors and precision components. According to the World Gold Council, technology demand for gold reached approximately 326 tonnes last year, a 7% year-over-year increase, translating to more than 10.5 million ounces consumed across electronics and industrial applications. As AI infrastructure expands worldwide, that appetite for conductive metals is projected to rise sharply. Positioned to meet this growing need, ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) (Profile) is advancing a fully funded, fully permitted gold-silver project engineered for near-term production and sustained growth. The company is working to align itself with the evolving ecosystem of producers and end users powering the next industrial transformation, including industry leaders such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM).

AI Boom Turns Metals into New Bottleneck As the digital economy expands, the constraint is no longer software innovation but the physical supply of metals that makes modern intelligence possible. According to Goldman Sachs Research, electricity consumption from data centers is projected to surge by up to 165% by 2030 compared with 2023 levels, driven by the rapid construction of AI-optimized, high-density facilities. This explosive scale-up is cascading through supply chains. Every new server, accelerator and switch relies on gold-plated connectors and silver-rich solders, components whose durability and conductivity depend on these metals’ unique characteristics. The result is not a minor adjustment but a full-scale infrastructure transformation that pushes materials from background costs to headline risks. When supply tightens, manufacturing cannot wait. Production lines must continue, forcing technology companies to pay premiums to secure critical inputs. The signs of strain are already visible. Utilities across the United States are revising capacity plans around surging AI-driven electricity demand, while analysts warn that global data center consumption could more than double by 2030. In the spot market, stress has flared as well: in October 2025, Reuters reported a silver shortage in London significant enough to require airlifting bars, sending lease rates sharply higher before stabilizing. For manufacturers, these developments mean urgency, not choice; when gold-plated contacts and silver-bearing solders are essential, there is no substitute. Electronics and renewable energy sectors are compounding the draw. The World Gold Council reports that technology demand for gold rose to 326 tonnes in 2024, equivalent to roughly 10.5 million ounces, while the Silver Institute logged industrial silver demand at a record 680.5 million ounces, marking the fourth consecutive year of structural deficit. Even smartphones are a steady source of consumption: Each device contains around 7 to 34 milligrams of gold, and with roughly 1.4 billion units produced annually, they represent a consistent, noncyclical sink before factoring in PCs, servers and networking equipment. The outcome is a tightening materials stack that increasingly dictates the pace and cost of AI, EV and solar deployment. Clean, Construction-Ready Supply on Track In this tightening landscape, ESGold is positioning its flagship Montauban Gold-Silver Project to deliver near-term, clean metal supply without the long permitting timelines or financing gaps that delay many mining ventures. The Québec-based project is fully permitted and fully funded through construction, which is slated for completion in late 2025, with first production anticipated in 2026. For investors, that combination of capital security, regulatory clearance and visible progress eliminates many of the standard risks that hinder development-stage projects. ESGold’s strategy centers on reprocessing historical tailings instead of pursuing a traditional greenfield mine build. By leveraging existing, mined material and a proven, environmentally responsible processing circuit, the company aims to accelerate its path to cash flow while preserving upside for broader district exploration. Company updates have detailed ongoing installation and commissioning of a Merrill-Crowe recovery system, alongside an on-site lab and gold room, all tangible milestones that mark the transition from planning to production readiness. Funding stability remains a cornerstone of ESGold’s story. A September 2025 update confirmed full financing to complete Montauban’s buildout and advance a parallel validation initiative in Colombia. In a market where many junior miners struggle for capital, a clear route to commissioning is a strategic advantage, particularly as industrial and technology players grow more attuned to materials security and reliable supply. Turning Waste into Value and Growth ESGold’s business model reverses the traditional mining playbook. Instead of requiring years of exploration and heavy upfront spending, it generates early revenue by reprocessing tailings — monetizing material already extracted — while contributing to environmental restoration. The company’s updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) outlines compelling economics, including an after-tax internal rate of return of about 60%, a payback period of less than two years, and an after-tax net present value above C$24 million at a 5% discount rate based on stated recovery and pricing assumptions. While PEAs are inherently preliminary, these figures depict a fast-cycling project capable of reinvesting capital into expansion and exploration. That pace matters in today’s market, where hardware manufacturers and energy developers face extended supply lead times. Bringing additional gold and silver to market by 2026 positions ESGold ahead of slower-moving peers. Self-funded growth also offers flexibility: Revenues from tailings can support step-out drilling or modular capacity increases with less dilution, strengthening long-term project resilience. Tailings reprocessing aligns neatly with modern environmental and supply chain priorities. Recovering metals from previously mined material reduces permitting complexity, minimizes new waste, and produces clean, saleable metal, all attributes increasingly valued by downstream buyers. As technology and renewable energy companies tighten ESG procurement standards, the intersection of early cash flow and responsible production widens ESGold’s potential offtake opportunities. Scalable Growth in a Supply-Constrained Market By working with known, high-grade tailings rather than exploring from scratch, ESGold eliminates much of the uncertainty that typically accompanies early-stage projects while maintaining upside for discovery across the Montauban district. The company’s steady construction progress on a fully permitted, fully financed project stands out in a preproduction sector where many competitors remain years away from revenue. Scalability is central to ESGold’s long-term vision. Tailings reprocessing is modular by design; it can be replicated efficiently across other regions once technical processes are validated. ESGold has indicated its intention to expand this “tailings-to-cash-flow” model throughout the Americas, layering in throughput and revenue while keeping risk manageable. This approach appeals to both end users, who seek diversified, verifiable metal sources, and financiers, who value repeatable, low-capex unit economics. Market conditions reinforce the opportunity. Industrial silver demand hit 680.5 million ounces in 2024, its highest level on record, while the global market ran a fourth consecutive deficit. For gold, the World Gold Council attributes technology-related growth to AI and electronics. In such an environment, near-term producers with proven funding and infrastructure readiness can capture premium pricing and preferred offtake relationships while others remain in development limbo. Expanding Discovery Across Montauban Alongside construction, ESGold is advancing exploration across the Montauban district. The company reports that its 3D geological modeling program is nearly complete, integrating historic and geophysical data to pinpoint deeper, previously untapped structures. Technical studies indicate continuous geological formations extending to about 1,200 meters, suggesting the potential for large-scale mineralization beyond the tailings resource. Earlier updates cited passive seismic imaging as a key tool refining Montauban’s structural understanding. The intent is to evolve from a single-site reprocessing project into a multifeed “hub and spoke” operation sourcing material from both tailings and new discoveries. ESGold’s parallel progress on permitting ensures drilling can begin swiftly once exploration targets are finalized, maintaining operational momentum. This dual-track approach — producing revenue while pursuing exploration — sets ESGold apart from peers that must choose between near-term cash flow and long-term upside. The Montauban project seeks to deliver both: immediate production from tailings and the potential for district-scale expansion. Even if only a portion of these deeper zones convert to defined resources, ESGold’s growth runway could extend well beyond its initial operating phase. This balance, near-term production with concurrent exploration, differentiates ESGold from juniors locked into long-dated builds. Investors are often forced to choose between cash flow and blue-sky upside. Montauban aims to deliver both, sequencing revenue first and then targeting scale. If even part of the deeper target set converts into resources, the platform for a multiyear district story strengthens. If not, the base case remains a permitted, funded operation monetizing tailings in a tight metals market. Ready Supply in Tightening Market Scarcity creates opportunity. With AI infrastructure, EV production and solar deployment all intensifying demand for precious metals, supply constraints are moving from a background concern to a central business risk for manufacturers. The Silver Institute’s data confirming consecutive structural deficits, along with spot-market disruptions such as the recent London squeeze, illustrate how quickly inventory stress can surface when industrial and investor demand converge. For producers capable of adding new metal supply with low capital costs and rapid paybacks, these market dynamics favor revaluation as production nears. Few preproduction companies can credibly claim to be both fully permitted and fully funded while advancing construction on schedule. ESGold’s PEA projects a roughly 60% after-tax internal rate of return and a payback under two years, underscoring the project’s efficiency. As AI and renewable infrastructure expand globally, the material bottleneck is becoming a defining theme, and ESGold is positioned to address it directly. The broader narrative returns to the core thesis: AI, electrification and renewable energy are as much materials revolutions as they are technological ones. Gold and silver are not merely safe-haven assets; they are essential building blocks of digital and clean energy ecosystems. As industrial demand rises and new mine development remains slow, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that can provide dependable near-term supply while maintaining exploration upside. ESGold belongs to this select group. With its Montauban Gold-Silver Project fully financed, fully permitted, and advancing toward production in 2026, the company offers both stability and scalability. Ongoing exploration adds long-term potential, creating a balanced opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the metals that underpin the next generation of technology and energy infrastructure. AI Expansion Accelerates as Global Leaders Invest in Next-Gen Infrastructure AI continues to reshape the global economy, driving unprecedented investment in data infrastructure, computing power and next-generation manufacturing. Around the world, leading innovators are unveiling ambitious projects that fuse advanced hardware, cloud computing and automation to support the explosive growth of AI. Meta Platforms Inc.

As industrial demand rises and new mine development remains slow, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that can provide dependable near-term supply while maintaining exploration upside. ESGold belongs to this select group. With its Montauban Gold-Silver Project fully financed, fully permitted, and advancing toward production in 2026, the company offers both stability and scalability. Ongoing exploration adds long-term potential, creating a balanced opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the metals that underpin the next generation of technology and energy infrastructure. AI Expansion Accelerates as Global Leaders Invest in Next-Gen Infrastructure AI continues to reshape the global economy, driving unprecedented investment in data infrastructure, computing power and next-generation manufacturing. Around the world, leading innovators are unveiling ambitious projects that fuse advanced hardware, cloud computing and automation to support the explosive growth of AI. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) announced that El Paso, Texas, will be home to the company’s next state-of-the-art data center, its 25th in the United States and 29th in the world. This almost 1.2 million-square-foot campus will be optimized for Meta’s AI workloads as part of the highly advanced infrastructure that helps connect billions of people around the world and will have the ability to scale to 1GW. Once completed, the El Paso Data Center will represent an investment of more than $1.5 billion and support approximately 100 jobs. The company anticipates that more than 1,800 construction workers will be onsite at the peak of construction. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) released its Master Plan Part IV, noting that, as the influence and impact of AI technology increases, the mission set forth in the plan should come as no surprise. “This next chapter will help create a world we’ve only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see,” the company stated. “We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world. . . . We are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all.” NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a landmark collaboration with Oracle to build the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”)’s largest AI supercomputer to dramatically accelerate scientific discovery. The Solstice system will feature a record-breaking 100,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and support the DOE’s mission of developing AI capabilities to drive technological leadership across U.S. security, science and energy applications. Another system, Equinox, will include 10,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and is expected to be available in the first half of 2026. Both systems will be interconnected by NVIDIA networking and deliver a combined 2,200 exaflops of AI performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) unveiled its next cutting-edge logic process technology, A14, at the company’s North America Technology Symposium. Representing a significant advancement from TSMC’s industry-leading N2 process, A14 is designed to drive AI transformation forward by delivering faster computing and greater power efficiency. It is also expected to enhance smartphones by improving their on-board AI capabilities, making them even smarter. Planned to enter production in 2028, the current A14 development is progressing smoothly with yield performance ahead of schedule. As AI adoption deepens across sectors, the momentum behind these large-scale investments highlights a shift toward sustainable, long-term growth built on intelligent infrastructure. Whether optimizing energy systems, powering research or enhancing daily connectivity, the collective progress underscores an interconnected future defined by the seamless collaboration of human ingenuity and machine intelligence.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Tighthead prop Sam Bishti will captain Ireland Under-20s in Friday night's challenge against South Africa in Cork, with head coach Andrew Browne naming a youthful squad for the visit of the defending world champions.

Just three of the matchday squad are returning U20 internationals from last season, with second row Donnacha McGuire, wing Charlie Molony and out-half Tom Wood - son of former Ireland captain Keith - all in the starting XV. Wood is part of an all-Munster half-back pairing, with UCC's Christopher Barrett. Head coach Browne will lead the coaching team for the 2026 U20 Six Nations before the arrival of Cullie Tucker as the new boss ahead of the 2026/27 season. The provincial breakdowns sees 11 Leinster-based players in the squad, with six from Munster, four from Connacht, one from Ulster, as well as Durham University's Fergus Callington, who has come through the Irish Qualified (IQ Rugby) system. Ireland U20 (v South Africa): Noah Byrne; Charlie Molony, Sean Walsh, James O'Leary, Daniel Ryan; Tom Wood, Christopher Barrett, Max Doyle, Lee Fitzpatrick, Sam Bishti (capt); Donnacha McGuire, Dylan McNiece; Joe Finn, Arthur Ashmore, Diarmuid O'Connell Replacements: Rian Handley, Christian Foley, Blake McClean, Sean Walsh, Michael O'Sullivan, Fergus Callington, Conor O'Shaughnessy, Johnny O'Sullivan Listen to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

Oracle stock crashes 25% in a month, wiping out billions in market value as investors panic over rising AI costs, shrinking margins, and slower cloud growth. Shares have slid to around $236, one of tech’s steepest monthly drops. Reports of a $100 million Nvidia chip rental loss and heavy data center spending have fueled fears of profit erosion. Bloomberg and Stocktwits both confirmed that Oracle’s AI-focused cloud push, while growing fast, has been far less profitable than expected. Once racing toward the $1 trillion club, Oracle now faces a harsh reality check — prove AI growth can pay off or risk deeper losses.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are higher this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Tuesday; the House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation to end the six-week U.S. government shutdown; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising after the chipmaker projected strong revenue growth over the coming years; the White House is reportedly examining measures that could limit the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers in shareholder voting; and shares of On Holding are soaring after the sneaker maker posted strong earnings and raised its guidance. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher as investors keep close tabs on developments in Washington D.C., with a key vote scheduled later today that could end government shutdown. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.2% recently after the blue-chip index closed at a record high on Tuesday. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was at just under $105,000, up from an overnight low of around $102,500. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $4,140 an ounce, trading near their highest levels in three weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was at 4.08%, down from the previous close of 4.11%. The House of Representatives is set to vote on a spending measure that would reopen the government through January and end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A key House committee moved the Senate-passed legislation forward in an early-Wednesday vote, rejecting attempts by some Democrats to amend the legislation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation, bringing an end to the shutdown, which is now in its 43rd day. The work stoppage has contributed to a freeze on U.S. government economic reports, while also creating staffing issues in the air traffic control system that prompted officials to reduce the number of flights. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped in premarket trading after CEO Lisa Su said the chipmaker’s revenue could grow by 35% annually over the next three-to-five years owing to continued strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. At the company’s first-ever analysts day on Tuesday, Su said that the company’s AI data center business could grow by 80% annually over the same period, potentially hitting tens of billions of dollars in sales by 2027. AMD also said its gross margins would come in at around 55% to 58% in coming years, ahead of analysts' forecasts. Shares of AMD, which have nearly doubled in value since the start of the year, were up 6% ahead of the bell. The White House is looking at new measures that would reduce the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers on shareholder voting, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Trump administration officials are considering executive orders that could ban proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis from making recommendations on shareholder votes. Officials are also looking to curtail the influence of index-fund managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, according to the report. The influence of proxy firms has been criticized by top corporate executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who faced resistance from proxy advisers ahead of a recent shareholder vote on his trillion-dollar pay package. Shares of On Holding (ONON) are soaring in premarket trading after the Roger Federer-backed Swiss sneaker maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook. On posted adjusted earnings of 0.43 Swiss francs ($0.54) per share on net sales that jumped 25% year-over-year to 794.4 million Swiss francs ($994.2 million), well above Wall Street estimates. The Zurich-based company, which lifted its guidance for a third straight quarter, now expects full-year sales to grow by 34% on a constant-currency basis, up from a previous projection of at least 31%. Profitability is also expected to rise. On co-founder and executive co-chairman Caspar Coppetti told CNBC the company won't be offering Black Friday deals and will be "full price through the holiday season." On shares, which through yesterday's close had shed more than a third of their value this year, were up 8% in recent trading.

"Circle continued to see accelerating adoption of USDC and our platform in the third quarter as we build the new Economic OS for the internet,” said Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, in a press release. He pointed to the successful launch of the Arc public testnet in October, with participation from over 100 companies including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, AWS, and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. In its statement, Circle noted that it is "exploring the possibility" of a native Arc token launch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues was pegged at $708.92 million, based off of predictions from four different analysts. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 17 cents per share, revised upward by 5 cents over the past 30 days. The company made its debut on the NYSE in June. Since the company went public, USDC's market capitalization has climbed from $61 billion to nearly $76 billion at the time of writing, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Analysts are expecting the stablecoin issuer will see a total of $2.68 billion in revenue this year. But that optimism wasn't evident in the company's share price heading into Wednesday. The company reported early Wednesday morning, before the opening bell in New York. Circle, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the CRCL ticker, closed on Tuesday at $98.30 after having fallen 5.57% during the session. About an hour before the company's earnings report, shares had fallen further to $94.04 in pre-market trading. The company is coming off a mixed Q2 report, when it reported a 53% increase in year-over-year revenue and a net loss of $4.48 per share. It was around that time the company unveiled plans for its L1 blockchain, Arc. The blockchain is optimized for stablecoin-focused applications. Arc will use USDC for gas, features a built-in FX engine, and enables opt-in privacy.

We have said from the outset that Bessent was an idiot. His hedge fund was microscopically small despite his Soros connection, which should have been an enormous marketing aid had he been any good. So he’s neither managed anything of size nor been a competent investor. His claims re his role in Soros short of the pound have always seemed exaggerated. Soros is hands-on, particularly with large bets. I suspect at most that Bessent executed trades or did some research. Admittedly John Helmer has depicted Kirill Dmitriev as a blowhard and a relentless self-promoter, but that does not make him wrong on the specific remarks that Bessent derided.

I’m calling the border collie herding a baby sheep video good, as in it really happened. In my visits to NZ in the early 80’s, there was 75 million sheep and 3 million people (down to 23 million sheep thrills and up to almost 5 million Kiwis @ present) and I ended up in a number of ‘Sheepedes’ that lasted 20 to 30 minutes as they just kept coming across the road-with border collies as canine cowboys, round ’em up, bring ’em out, keep ’em in line, rawhide! We are currently foster parents for a border collie. While they are bright, athletic dogs, if you don’t have some chickens or sheep or goats for them to herd, they try to herd you. When the challenge of herding our geese and ducks wasn’t enough, my border collie used to try to herd my kids when they were small. Was more successful than I was. Border Collies are relentless, they even (sort of) herd cats. A friend of mine has a border collie who herds bikers. I find it extremely funny even if I am a keen biker. When you are fostering it. Have you noted who the dog has decided to be the “boss” in the herd? Shadow chasing is another one. Collies can be quite prone to OCD. My better half grew up with a collie in the countryside. It used to attempt to nip the back tyres of passing cars, which terrified me. Don’t be too frightened for doggo. We had a Border Collie that chased cars too. He caught two, and died of old age. British readers may remember the joys of “One Man and His Dog” a sheepdog trials show that was on BBC early Sunday evenings throughout my younger years. The intelligent dogs, the farmers communicating with a whistle and calling “come bai”. The excitement when one of the sheep got separated from the pack and tried to go rogue. I loved that show. Border collies are amazing. Here’s a clip from the 1990s. Trial stats at 4.30 https://youtu.be/fHs5cT5kL58 Thank you, Ben. + 1. “It’s in the power of the eye!” Nice choice of YouTube clip. I told you (below) that TV show is good for a few chuckles. There exist contexts in which a TV sport commentator can say, “For a nine-year old bitch she’s still extremely fast.” Definitely real. I have a rescue that genetic testing showed was perhaps 1/8th border collie, and he does these moves all the time – to us, to dogs he meets, to the feral cats, etc. We were confused at first because the herding dogs I saw previously didn’t get so low to the ground, then I saw a couple videos of border collies and bingo! I would ‘rather claw out [my] own eyes’ than accept a three-month rolling average on a chart that exclusively uses the first eleven days of January across multiple years, which maybe I could get talked into, except it is literally connecting unconnected dots when it links the lines up as tho it is longitudinally contiguous. Rhetorical misrepresentation. (That last sentence scans, that’s when you know I’m miffed.) (Just noticed ‘longitudinally contiguous’ scans too. Whoa Momma! tern should know better.) This is presumably in DD-MM-YYYY format (rather than MM-DD), no? Yes, it is. By the way: there is an international ISO norm regarding dates, and it has the format YYYY-MM-DD. I use it quite systematically — it is unambiguous and is quite appropriate for sorting data. My biggest grudge against people writing the datetime libraries for different programming languages is that none of them use the ISO 8601 as basis and standard. It can handle dates, times, timestamps, time differences, time zones, duration, intervals, recurring intervals and eras. And it’s logical, proceeding from the lowest precision to the highest precision. Somebody should also fix the decimal separator issue for good. no, yes. Thank you, that makes sense. OMG, that chart is so awful. An innumerate LARPing as a statistics postdoc This is why I prefer to be cautious in attributing everything bad to COVID. There is real evidence of risks and damage from each infection, but not everything bad is COVID. “Saudi Arabia’s Dystopian Futuristic City Project Is Crashing and Burning” This project never made sense from the get-go. It seemed to be a cross between a vanity project and a white elephant and was sopping up enormous amounts of resources. In any case, who is even supposed to live in this city assuming it was finished? Saudi Arabia would have been better in spending the money on infrastructure, particularly drought-proofing the country. Considering how many countries are experiencing severe water shortages, that might be a wiser investment. Drought-proofing Saudi Arabia through judicious investment in water management infrastructure? You are talking about the country that decided to empty its aquifers to grow crops in the literal desert. Sir Norman, in addition to being a very talented architect, is one of our era’s greatest con men. His understanding of the vulnerabilities of the plutocratic mind is unparalleled. Doomsday Scoreboard (Micael T) In their 1997 book The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy, historians William Strauss and Neil Howe predicted that between 2005 and 2026 the United States would experience a “Fourth Turning” crisis—a period of social upheaval on the scale of the Revolution, Civil War, or Great Depression. Multiple commentators link recent U.S. crises (2008 recession, 2020 pandemic, political polarization) to this forecast, though no conclusive “cataclysm” has occurred. The cycle is set to resolve by ~2026. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I’m quite taken by the Fourth Turning, or 80 years later if you’d like. Everything lines up so perfectly… 1781 Yorktown 1861 Fort Sumter 1941 Pearl Harbor 2022 Ukraine 1837 Financial Panic-1917 US enters WW1 1849 Gold Rush-1929 Great Depression 1893 Financial Panic-1971 US goes off gold standard 1907 Financial Panic-1987 Financial Panic 1929 Financial Panic-2008 Financial Panic add-on 1865 Appomattox-1945 Tokyo Bay That is a fun scroll. One thing ought to be noted about it. The end-of-the-world predictions related to Christianity are far different from current predictions about the fall of the American Empire or neoliberalism or capitalism. The religious predictions actually entail a physical destruction of the planet to be replaced by a new and better model. If the American Empire falls, it won’t be fun for us who live here, but the planet will continue, perhaps for the better. It all depends on how well the rest of the world can ease the USA down. I’m sure that the Empire will not go quietly. Who will secure its nukes? 1945 Hiroshima & Nagasaki-2025 ? 2025-Teheran & Tel Aviv I doubt if Pakistan will nuke Jerusalem, Dome of the Rock and all that, but I’m not so sure about India. Howe has since extended his timeline to 2032. Historian David Kaiser has an alternative interpretation based on the original Strauss/Howe timeline. He thinks the Fourth Turning already happened, but the BushBama regime failed to unite America with a solution to the financial crises and permanent GWOT, so now we’re in an extended period of disgruntlement sort of like the post-reconstruction era. Very glad to see the bonus antidotes today. The sheepdog scene is perhaps to some UK TV viewers not so unusual. Since the 1970s sheepdog trials have been a televised sport in the UK. Close ups of the dog standing still close to the sheep aren’t unusual. Impressive all the same. The BBC produced a show called One Man and His Dog which my mum liked to watch. What the dogs and shepherds accomplish is very impressive but as a TV sport it’s inherently funny, like golf or snooker, owing to the voice commentary having to find novel things to say about it. I expect there are some old clips of the show on YouTube. The cat is wise. My Lucy runs from the room when the printer operates. Following up on yesterday’s Farmer’s Almanac link, it turns out that there are two Old Moores. The Irish Old Moore, Theophilus, was a teacher of languages, a mathematician, and an astrologer. His Old Moore’s Almanac has been going since 1764. The English Old Moore, Francis, was a court astrologer and physician and his Old Moore’s Almanack (note the K) has been going since 1697. Agree! Antidotes without exhaustive investigation to authenticate their authenticity surpass no antidotes by around a million million times. Yes. All doom and no fun makes you go crazy. I always appreciate the antidotes :) > I expect there are some old clips of the show on YouTube. See my comment above :) re: Gaza fascism Germany Kinda funny in a desperate way – Jason Stanley was invited to Germany (Jewish community Frankfurt) to speak about – fascism – what else – on November 9th (saint date) and eventually couldn´t finish his speech becoz “Gaza” – so what about “fascism” now, Stanley? I applaud his honesty. But if the very society claiming absolute wisdom on issues of Holocaust and “fascism” yet over and over and over again denies the genocide “in our time”, what sense does it make to constantly use the term until it has turned hollow because no one listens who does not happen to be a leftist intellectual. It is a very strang situation – I listen to Walter Kirn and then to John Bellamy Foster – go figure. Remember the botched raid on the Marion Record newspaper in Kansas? From the AP and the tv news channel KCTV5: Kansas county agrees to pay $3 million over police raid on a small-town newspaper, editor says. https://www.kctv5.com/2025/11/11/kansas-county-agrees-pay-3-million-over-police-raid-small-town-newspaper-editor-says/ thanks! Seconded. So many of those events that make a big, immediate impact when they occur tend to disappear in the memory hole — especially if things do not unfold according to the approved narrative. Good news. There being consequences for this kind of police behavior is not a given these days. Yves, the Military Summary link might be wrong. The link text says 2025.11.11 but it links to a video two days older with the title Killzone🔴Defense on the Zaporizhzhia Front is Crumbling in Real Time⚡️💥Military Summary 2025.11.09 The state of search on YT is such that I can’t even find that 11.09 video so I have no idea how that happened (I did not watch it). Putting in an 11.11 Killzone link. The search function for YouTube is borked. You can put in a search term and enclose it with inverted commas to search for what you want. But half the search results that come back have absolutely nothing to do with what you are looking for. And the feed is filled with these goofy knock-offs with a thousand subscribers robbing material from interviews of popular commentators from Mearsheimer to Candace. The original interviews or commentary are crowded out. An attempt to starve the content creators or at least slow the growth of ones who speak in contradiction to the Establishment narrative? I hate those. Awful. But sometimes the channel crowds out its own video. It pisses me off no end that Nima will, a couple of days after a long interview, will repost 20-30 minute clips with a different header AND then remove the original!!! I am never giving him a dime due to that behavior. Yves, I want to confirm what .Tom wrote below. I just clicked back 7 months on the “LIVE” tab on Nima’s Dialogue Works and all his long-form interviews are there. I didn’t go further back. Nima, JudgeNap, and other sites should clarify how they use YouTube’s tabs. Nima, JudgeNap, and other sites should clarify how they use YouTube’s tabs. They don’t have a choice on what goes under what YouTube tab. Livestreams go under live tab. That’s it. Judge does his shows live, each one as a separate half hour livestream. Some do a long livestream, and then post interesting parts of it as separate videos, for those that don’t want to watch the whole thing. Bullshit. The channel puts a note under each video summarizing what it is about. Nima et al could easily mention that the shorter segments are clipped from a longer original interview, with a links to them. But they don’t. They want to sucker viewers into thinking a (typically weekend) rerun is fresh content. YouTube search is … yeah. You can go to the Military Summary channel page https://www.youtube.com/@militarysummary then click the Videos tab and navigate by date. For some channels like Dialogue Works or Judge Nap use the Live tab instead of Videos tab. In any case, the Home tab is usually no use. re: German farmland vs. Big Agro interview by BERLINER ZEITUNG use google-translate Foreign countries are buying up German farmland: “We are experiencing the second structural break in East Germany” Reinhard Jung from the Brandenburg Farmers’ Association on the sell-off of German agricultural land, the failure of politics – and why Germany is losing control. https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/wirtschaft-verantwortung/ausland-kauft-deutsche-aecker-bauernbund-warnt-vor-zweitem-strukturbruch-in-ostdeutschland-li.10004589 “Following the takeover of Deutsche Agrar Holding (DAH) – including around 20,000 hectares of farmland in eastern Germany – by the Australian fund Igneo, an old concern has been rekindled: the “sell-off” of German soil. Thuringian farmer Reiko Wöllert warned in an interview with the Berliner Zeitung of the loss of farmers’ control – his words sparked a broad debate.” Scott Bessent’s Damaging Remarks Puts More Distance between Washington and Moscow Larry Johnson. He is signalling to his PMC comrades that he is in the “correct” side of history. What the populaces think about his words doesn’t matter. So, yes, the same kind of idiot as Starmer, Merz, Macron et al. I’ve seen Bessent in action and he acts like some sort of bully boy and makes criticisms based on what he thinks is real instead of having the Treasury department give him the straight dope. Still, being a bully boy makes him a good fit in the Trump Cabinet. But I do not think that he will give Trump the true picture of the US economy as Trump would not like that. Bessent is just a dummy who is projecting … calls Dmitriev a liar, but he himself is lying through his teeth about India buying Russian oil. Here is the key quote from Larry Johnson: Moreover, I think it is highly likely that Russia and India will find a way to use a third party to continue shipping oil to India in order for India to continue to have access to affordable oil. India just set up a big trading exchange that settles accounts in non-dollars. Rupees/Yuan, Rupees/Dinar, etc. They can set up intermediaries who will buy the oil, settle in rupees, and pass it along (with a cut, of course.) Bessent is either an illiterate who forgot basic economics – if a commodity is priced lower than market price and there is demand for it, middlemen will step in to make a market. Or he’s lying through his teeth. I suspect the latter. But he is gay! (I didn’t ask, I don’t care; but I got told anyway) “Breaking barriers” is more important than competence. ‘Log Cabinet’ member? I wonder if that is in his Lincoln profile. I used to think that Gay Republican meant “Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy.” Now I understand that it means “Epstein Bait.” Robert Barnes was on the Duran yesterday dissecting parts of the Trump administration, with particular animus against Bessent. Very entertaining and colorful, though he still has faith in crypto and in Vance. https://www.youtube.com/live/2MjEkOKoHcg?si=-v9KylaLQAiO3vEd IMO, Barnes, or at least his twitter feed, consistently offers the correct diagnosis (even if you don’t share his worldview)—-but offers the wrong treatments, lmao I always learn something from Robert. Yesterday he said the reason Marco Rubio, a blue-collar son of Cuban refugees, became a successful politician was because his sister married one of the original cocaine cowboys of south Florida. Thinking Miami Vice here. He also got in an actual fistfight with Musk while in the West Wing. Apparently the reason Musk was banned from the White House and then retaliated with a tweet saying that Trump is in the Epstein list. Almost makes me say that Bessent can’t be all bad, but I guess it’s just two total jerks fighting, so it’s still all bad. Though one can still cheer them on. I was not aware that GM’s CEO Mary Barra was previously GM’s head of HR. Barra has been criticized for abrupt firings of well-liked, and well-credentialed executives both recently recruited or having long GM careers. Eric Starkman is a columnist in our local online news mostly news aggregator, http://www.deadlinedetroit.com and Barra critic. He has written about fired executives as easily disposable “Barra bees.” http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32623/starkman_why_gm_employees_should_bail_on_ceo_mary_barra_and_avoid _early_morning_termination_events and http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32552/starkman_gm_under_ceo_mary_barra_is_an_undeniably_soulless_and_dishonest_company changing GM’s old logo to its current sans-serif, lower case “gm” (sic) was the most HR-thing ever, lmao maybe Mary should worry more about build quality, diversifying the model portfolio away from trucks, and V-8 engines not grenade-ing “V-8 engines not grenade-ing” from utube, They Won’t Tell You THE TRUTH About GM V8 ENGINES, So I’ll Do It! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7nr9u2zkfM Mary Barra should also lead an effort to make the front grill of GM vehicles less of a pedestrian killer as they push pedestrians underneath rather than on top of the hood. But then I like the old trucks from the late 1940’s, early 1950’s with the rounded lines. I bought a 1958 Chevy Apache pickup in 1974 for $300. Loved the hood with the little devil horns. It had rusted holes in the floor on both sides large enough to eject empty beer cans. Small cars are also at risk from those behemoths. I saw what looked like a stock (no apparent lift kit) late-model GM pickup parked on the street behind a Toyota iQ the other day and the hood of the pickup was pretty much level with the top of the iQ. One of the benefits of my 1978 New Yorker is that it still came equipped with the pedestrian gunsight on the hood. Sadly, the blood red paint on the coat of arms is fading after all these years. She’s a great person in other ways as well Mr. Wenig and Mr. Wymer have no such worries. In June, Mr. Wenig was re-elected to the board of General Motors, a position that pays $317,000 a year. Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, called the cyberstalking scandal “regrettable” but noted “it didn’t involve any GM business.” Inside eBay’s Cockroach Cult: The Ghastly Story of a Stalking Scandal (NY Times via archive.ph) I guess in this case she forgot her HR mindset. Thanks for that link. The story is truly appalling and both Wenig and Wymer should be in prison, as if that would ever happen. Thanks for the links. The ‘deadline detroit’ 3rd link includes this: Perhaps in the greater scheme of GM’s global workforce of 163,000 employees, but it represents 4% of GM’s Tech Center workforce, assuming the 25,000 workers GM says its Tech Center employs is a current number. GM fired 600 software engineers assigned to its Tech Center campus in August. That’s crazy. Barra herself notes customers are complaining about the clunky software used to transition the screen between options, especially Apple and Android connections. A problem that could be fixed with better car software. Her answer? Layoff tech software engineers and….get rid of Apple Car Play and Android Auto and other ‘troublesome’ connections in the new cars. Let a 3rd party design new software. More subscription money extracted from car “owners” and advertisers. https://tech.yahoo.com/transportation/articles/gm-drops-apple-carplay-android-135933968.html Yeah, that’ll work. / ;) I want my, I want my ChatGPT I want my, I want my ChatGPT I want my, I want my ChatGPT I want my, I want my ChatGPT Now look at them kosher nostras, that’s the way you do it You play them for fools on AI & ChatGPT That ain’t working, that’s the way you do it Money for nothing and your clicks for free Now that ain’t working, that’s the way you do it Lemme tell ya, them Hasbara guys ain’t dumb Maybe get a blister on your little finger Maybe get a blister on your thumb We got to install influence covenants Custom distortion deliveries We got to move these goys along We got to move these Zionist themes Listen here Now that ain’t working, that’s the way you do it You play them for chumps on the ChatGPT That ain’t working, that’s the way you do it Money for nothing, and your clicks for free Money for Nothing, by Dire Straits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTP2RUD_cL0&list=RDwTP2RUD_cL0 The kosher nostras (nice one) might be doing us a small favor. By destroying the perceived impartiality of AI, they’ve undermined trust. Once nobody trusts that “muh AI” is unbiased and free from tampering by the Central Scrutinizer, they’ll ditch it and rediscover the joys of using your mind. Maybe. Well, we can always hope. It’s useful for timeless questions like Should I put bacon on the salad? Obviously not. Duh! And you shouldn’t eat cheeseburgers either. So Isr is going to try “google bombing” AI. Doesn’t surprise me. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bombing Absolutely: The Economist catches up with what a colleague has been complaining about for years, rule by HR ladies. Further, DEI in various iterations has been around for quite a while. This sentence bemusedly gets to the point, but the chronology is older than the 2020s: ‘ For an “insecure” profession that is “prone to scramble around for fashions and fads”, in the words of one hr director, dei brought plenty to keep busy with, from micro-aggressions to non-gendered toilets. ‘ Jennifer Pan was interviewed by Joshua Citarella on his excellent DoomScroll vlog. The interview is entitled “Selling Social Justice.” She describes the coopting of these initiatives into an extension of management. As Adolph Reed keeps pointing out, a more “diverse” ruling class of oppressors is still a group of oppressors. The expression “rule by HR ladies” also reminded me of a phenomenon that I see / saw in my career in publishing. I’m sure other commenters have seen the same phenomenon in their fields: The division of organizations into fiefdoms. HR is definitely “feminized space” — although it’s main job is to defend the company against the employees. In certain realms of publishing, editorial is women, and marketing is the men. It all becomes a tad too obvious. Oddly, though, publishers just can never find young black men to hire. I wonder why. It’s not just publishers whose HR departments can’t find the black people. A company I’m familiar with determined several years ago that it was short on minority hires and about that same time, the entire workforce was blessed with DEI training. Some did wonder why the rest of the company needed “training” because HR couldn’t hire any minorities (heal thyself!), but I digress…. The solution? An explicit call for more employees to refer minority friends for open positions, with referral bonuses being doubled if it resulted in a minority hire. I wish I was kidding. It has taken me a while to find it but that Economist article is a just a rehash of a Times article from September. https://archive.is/xemtx#selection-1459.0-1463.16 How HR took over British business and got in the way of actual work There are now more people working in human resources departments in Britain than there are doctors or lawyers. They have made workplaces more pleasant but at what cost to productivity? Harry Wallop reports Thursday September 18 2025, 5.00am BST, The Sunday Times [Don’t as me why the Sunday Times publish on Thursday. It’s an internet thing…?] All the worst organisations I have worked in had HR as a major power centre and the HR director as some witchy familiar of the CEO. Their common failing as organisations has been the HR mentality: defensive, duplicitous and at every opportunity valuing form and process over judgment. Toxic cargo cults, the lot of them! Re: Ben Shapiro saying people should move for jobs. Is This The WORST TAKE On The Affordability Crisis? Young Turks, YouTube. It’s gratifying to watch Ben Shapiro self-destruct. ***** That’s actually pretty standard conservatism from the 1990s and 2000s, “we gotta move people to jobs and not jobs to people”, so it’s good to see some growth in thinking among the conservative base, away from Ben Shapiro, National Review, etc. Ben Shapiro says lots of stuff which he does not think through- ‘ADAM @AdameMedia Nov 9 Ben Shapiro: Reparations don’t work. Charlamagne: They worked for Jewish people. (They *still* receive HoIocaust reparations) Shapiro: Erm, uh, that’s totally different! Israel took $500b from America (and $30B since Oct 7). It still begs for more. https://xcancel.com/AdameMedia/status/1987321638669717962#m Rev what the hell is this? After all the rhetoric this decade on reparations not being a solution, the USA, France et al. gave and have been giving them to holocaust survivors this whole time? What about Native Americans and black slave descendants? Why has France still not given Haiti back their money? What about flipping Vietnam reparations? What about Iran, Iraq, Afganistan, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Cuba, Panama, Grenada, Peru, Venezuala, Palestine, hell even Japan, South Africa and Russia not to mention tens more I’m sure I’m forgetting. The US didn’t even ouright persecute Jews during WWII more than they supported Apartheid in SA, so what the hell are they giving them reparations for? So I see a collision of recent STEM graduates who buy a house with a 50 year mortgage (with very equity) finding no jobs due to US deindustrializing and shutting down biomedical research walking away to China or Russia for a sustainable job (and probably leaving both debts behind). “Failure to plan is planning to fail.” Just spitballing here, but I think the demand in China or Russia for US graduates who never considered learning Chinese or Russian is going to be quite low. Although that observation does support your aphorism. Oh, I know some young scholars who are tackling mandarin. A job these days is a great incentive. Some Chinese guys were trying to recruit me about a decade ago. I was very tempted. What’s tackling language 6 if it keeps you fed…? Would a hire of somebody from a deindustrializing country be known as a ‘westback’? Foreign devil Get the Epstein LLC involved and you can call it a bawdy shop. Whiteneck? “we gotta move people to jobs and not jobs to people” So, get more migrants in, instead of outsourcing everything. Lavrov: “The EU may argue that we ‘invaded’ Ukraine in violation of certain agreements.” “We wanted Ukraine to keep its economic ties with Russia.” “Let’s take a year off.” *Blink* Parse at your own risk. That ain’t my take. “Paris, France. Andrei Martyanov” I see this everywhere. In one of the small towns in Normandy near me, I recently saw seniors getting together to share their bounty from the local Carrefour supermarket, under the market square roof. They brought thermoses of coffee and tea to share with each other. About 15 people. I was also recently in an industrial park in a suburb of a major 2 tier city, to pick up some paint for my house. Next to the paint supplier was a food bank “Les Restos du Coeur”. There was a line of at least 50, in the middle of the afternoon on a Wednesday. People looked working/middle class. Decently dressed, many with their children (Wednesday afternoon is off for grade schoolers). Before the pandemic, I’d see groups of pensioners in Versailles, in front of the Franprix there, by the movie theatre. Maybe 10, like the video posted. At the intersection of D capitulationism and L’affaire Epstein, the thought occurs that in addition to potentially or probably (depending on what the Rs do with the promised ACA vote) keeping the ACA premium subsidies issue alive for the mid-terms, by bring the House back into session to deal with the continuing resolution, the capitulation accelerates the Epstein files discharge petition that Speaker Johnson would prefer to suppress. It might actually be smart politics (from D party interests perspective, regardless of real-world impacts on the population); the fact that it is being characterized as D fecklessness might be a bonus. This thought is not offered in praise of the Party; what has been done might be an objectively evil calculation, but a clever one. I think they’re playing good cop/bad cop. The “centrist” dems were recruited by the dnc to be the firewall against any movement left. It’s a rotating and unbeatable cast from manchin and sinema to the current crop of left wing republicans, We are a one party state, Remember the mississippi guy who self financed and was excoriated by the “centrists” for bucking the party. Mamdani sends chills down their spine. Socialism is for the rich and deserving. Part at least of the reason the r’s can’t replace ocare is because ocare is their plan so the protests are all an act. From their collective perspective mamdani winning was a major loss. They’re despicable. And guaranteed grocery lobbyists were banging their turkey pans to get the money flowing. Maybe the epstein thing will pan out, and maybe not,As an confirmed cynic I lean to the latter. Somebody tell me what I’m missing other than the Democrats wanting to slow walk to the day ACA health insurance premiums are $5,000 per month and still in need of subsidies. As I am ALWAYS in search of methods to amuse myself, I was over the moon wonderstruck by the link to the young lady playing classic rock on the Chinese lute. I lost an hour of a otherwise mundane morning grinning from ear to ear. Thank you for the link, which has now been shared with all my music friends (with source attribution, of course) She’s good, but can she do covers with throat singing in Mongolian translation? Side note: The Hu mostly do originals. Had a chance to see the, live a few years ago and they were great. The Hu were one of the bands that helped get me out of the grumpy old man “all new music sounds like stuff I’ve heard before” doldrums I had been in for a while. Their first album is truly special. Last year they released a cover of Iron Maiden’s The Trooper: The HU – “The Trooper” (Official Music Video) In case of “all new music sounds like stuff I’ve heard before” syndrome, nine out of ten doctors recommend getting out of your comfort zone. :) Jokes aside, musical genres can be defined as stuff that sounds like some other stuff. There is always new & unheard stuff in unconsumed genres, and in the space betwen them (for an example see below). Here’s something for your musical friends :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT7x1NvGf5k&list=RDEM6kSy5Si3f_-hq8qxMKi3Lw Hudson/Wolff on Mamdani and much else. Great stuff. https://michael-hudson.com/2025/11/municipal-socialism-meets-donor-politics/ “And the Republicans and Democrats want to treat New York City like the United States and Europe treated Soviet Russia after its revolution.” Might want to slow the row on all of that hyperbole. Not denying the part about the obstacles coming, but it’s not like it was the Russian Revolution. Mamdani could play Kerensky in this psychodrama. “TRUMP PLAYS THE OLD CIA CARDS FOR REGIME CHANGE” A pro-tip for the Trump regime. If you are going to send covert operations teams into a country like Venezuela, then best you do not advertise the fact but keep everything quiet. Trump does not need the spectacle of a bunch of captured CIA spooks shown off in public. Caitlin Johnstone explains the Israeli “don’t be a sucker” method. https://consortiumnews.com/2025/11/10/caitlin-johnstone-israels-successful-method/ Trump calls this “the art of the deal.” “If I don’t steal your home, someone else will steal it” 3 Epstein emails released by the Dems, all involving Trump. https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/3-emails_redacted.pdf Per the Guardian In one of the memos, Epstein wrote to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011 that Trump “spent hours at my house” in the company of one of the disgraced financier’s sex-trafficked victims. The memo describes the president as “that dog that hasn’t barked”, and notes Trump had “never once been mentioned” in connection with what has become a long-running scandal overshadowing his second term of office. A second message, sent by Epstein in April 2011 to Trump biographer Michael Wolff, indicates that Trump had asked him to resign from Mar-a-Lago, the president’s exclusive members-only club in Florida. But Epstein said he was “never a member ever” and adds “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”. Ben Panga: It’s all fun and games till Bill and Hillary show up on lists. Then watch the Dems squeal. My attitude: Mr. Guillotine’s clever meat slicer. One size fits all. Bill and Hill are pretty far back in the rear-view mirror, even for the Dems. A trade of sacrificing that duo in exchange for taking down Trump seems more than even, to me. Then there is the Wizard of Kalorama, who would surely benefit somehow from all of their downfall. I’m more than a bit skeptical of the authenticity of those emails, no? I find Whitney Webb’s articles credible. By that metric, specifically the power dynamic Webb describes existing in the sphere of Epstein’s bosses and business associates, the Clintons may be untouchable. The same method would explain Maxwell still being alive and enjoying privileges while in confinement. This is Robert Maxwell’s daughter after all. I always said the NC link header “L’affaire Epstein” should be “L’affaire Maxwell-Epstein”. Last night’s northern lights was quite something to see~ Tonight’s spectacle promises to be something special, peaking around 10 pm @ an overhead view near you. Unfortunately it looks as if Big Smokes and coastal cities in Cali will have poor visibility for the event, time for an after-work road-trip Californios! Our new planetarium had a great show called Aurora where a photographer went to Yellow Knife in Canada and pointed a hi def wide view camera straight up at the Northern Lights. On the planetarium dome it’s you are there. Spectacular. > Starmer allies issue warning to PM’s rivals as fears grow over leadership challenge Guardian What do dissidents in the PLP think they accomplish by replacing Starmer as PM with Angela Rayner, Shabana Mahmood or Ed Miliband? Seems to me the constraints of any neoliberal UK government are pretty much set and policies follow from that. Any such government will be hated soon enough. Making Miliband the face of it doesn’t fix much. Or what am I missing? Reportedly Labour party members are terrified that they are going to lose huge numbers of local government seats at the elections due in May 2026. Some seem to think that a fresh face will enable them to reduce their losses then. All very short-term thinking. Of course the big showdown, the national General Election, will probably not take place until 2029. Today, the House does something it hasn’t done since September 19th: show up for a vote. And even in September, these stumblebums worked for a grand total of twelve days. Must be nice. Back in July, when the cowardly Mike Johnson skedaddled out of town like a fly-by-night con artist to evade a vote on the Epstein files, NFL training camps hadn’t even opened. The plan apparently is to vote on the new bill to reopen the government, take a long weekend, and possibly work a few days next week before disappearing again for Thanksgiving week. I think this deserves a tribute in song.

This including both state and federal members. I would love to see elected officials be legally required not just to have to meet the responsibilities of their job more than their fundraising, but to have one of the required responsibilities to be regularly meeting with the people they are elected to represent. Instead we are paying a lot of people to beg and suck up to a small coterie of rich people. One of the arguments I heard Mike “the weasel” Johnson make was to the effect of, “oh, we’re still working, we’re just back in our districts meeting with constituents.” And there may be some truth to that, although something tells me that not all 435 of these guys and gals were really spending their time talking to the rabble, and not off on a junket bending the knee for the Israeli flag. Or fundraising. Your idea is an excellent one, but I have no idea if it would pass Constitutional muster. I’m 100% for such meetings! Considering how much of their time is occupied in funds raising, perhaps the best way to rein in the political parties would be to revoke their tax exempt status. Then go after all those dodgy “Advocacy Committees.” simpler to just feed them to the pigs and start over. altho i am a bit drunk and surly…spent 3 hours in a mudhole fixin mom’s ancient water supply pipe(1960’s era black poly pipe)…and cannot lay down, lest i seize up, entirely. laid down the law…instead of spending 25K on fixin the whole decrepit system under her house, she will pay me 5k to walk by and get it done, come spring. all the 100+ years of under the house plumbing will be simply disconnected, and left in place. all the random repairs done in that time, by unknown folks, with whatever was to hand, ignored. we’ll do what i did with my house, and go around the perimeter, and only come into the house where required…. that 3 hours of bullshit honey-do kicked my ass….and covered my whole body with mud. but i walked by, and got it done, and she has water. fie. Poor man, well do I remember the abomination that is black poly pipe. Coterminal with the old multi-layered tarpaper sewer pipe. The only thing I feared more than those two was repairing lead and oakum joints in cast iron sewer pipe. Sleep well, you’ve earned it. Myself spent hours digging under the porch, tracking a groundhog tunnel that took aim at our new sewer line. Second hole I dug myself in today. Thanks for the song. Excellent work once again. Disrespecting sacred spaces is part of… the hallmark of Western imperial colonialism. Ànd probably colonialism in general. I am not a scholar. Common experiences of many sacred spaces in times of conquest–symbolically convert infidels’ houses of worship to your own, if they are important enough, or blow them up. Hagia Sofia is a famous example, but many mosques/churches in Iberia and Middle East used to be churches/mosques, and, of course, many Protestant churches used to be Catholic (well, almost anything in England) and quite a few churches belonging to the wrong peoples were blown up (if only figuratively in some cases), like Alexander Nevski in Warsaw. Just wait until the nukes go off above Jerusalem. Meanwhile in Ellison world claims that they are blacklisting actors who object to genocide. Guess Emma Stone won’t get to star in any of Taylor Sheridan’s dubious products. https://scheerpost.com/2025/11/11/paramount-blacklisting-hollywood-figures-critical-of-gaza-genocide/ More Teens Are Taking Antidepressants. It Could Disrupt Their Sex Lives for Years. (NY Times Mag via archive.ph) Research on adults who take S.S.R.I.s shows they tamp down sexual desire. Why aren’t we studying what that could mean for adolescents who take them? You know what else is happening to teens and adults every year? COVID. COVID penis is a thing. If you want a functional johnson, don’t get infected! But we don’t care about repeat infections with a level 3 biohazard, no issues there! The effects of S.S.R.I.s on young sexuality are all the more relevant because prescriptions for the drugs have soared. Around two million 12-to-17-year-olds in the United States are on S.S.R.I.s. One large 2024 study in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics tallied, month by month, the percentage of that age group who filled an antidepressant prescription between 2016 and 2022. During that time, the rate climbed by 69 percent, with the Covid pandemic’s emotional reverberations almost surely playing a part, though a notable rise was underway before then. Among college students in 2023-24, according to a survey with over 100,000 participants, 22 percent had taken an antidepressant during the previous year. This was up from 8 percent in 2007. (bold mine) If you think that’s bad, just wait until you get long COVID! Does long COVID come with long johnson? It might leave you longing for the return of your johnson. An old girlfriend of mine didn’t call it a johnson…she called it an opportunity.

Jobs with a heavy math or computer science component are most at risk, he said. Thanks Obama! For most roles, India offers employers significant salary savings relative to other countries. For an entry level role at a US bank’s GCC, an engineering graduate could earn between 300,000 rupees ($3,384) to 800,000 rupees a year, depending on the location. That compares with $60,000 for an Indian on a US visa, and up to $120,000 for a US citizen in the same role, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s some serious labor arbitrage, no? And once again we see that H1B was about suppressing US wages. What is the tweet from “RT.” supposed to be claiming? $NVAX has been flat since 2023.

Reminds me of the Brazilian movie Bacurau. It should remind you of Ukraine, and Syria, and all the other places where USA sponsored “freedom fighters” did their thing, and still do their thing. For sure, and in this case willing to pay around a hundred grand for the privilege. To be weekend snipers, they reportedly paid the equivalent of between €80,000 ($92,800) and €100,000 ($116,000), according to the first hypotheses of the investigation. Shooting at children cost more. Alleged, thesis, allegedly, according to the complaint, reportedly, according to the first hypotheses, rumored, clues about the possibility, “an urban legend”, Russian. In this case, I belive that the USA side did it, just like in all other cases. Accusing the “Russians” is part of the spiel. I won’t argue that point as it’s always a reasonable argument, and it sounds like something the izzies/usians would do. It’s the demand side that baffles me. And this was back in the 90s. How much has the industry grown since then? The client list would likely make for interesting reading. I heard the same about Lebanon during the civil war there. Wealthy westerners would pay for trips in to do a bit of sniping so that they could go home with some human kills on their board. Something tells me though that those kills were not Lebanese soldiers or militias. An ingenious way to fund the cause, it’s like having a bake sale. Speaks well of the human condition, lol.

Title: Crypto Tokenization Under Scrutiny: Global Regulators Cite Risks Amid Split Opinions
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-tokenization-global-regulators-cite-risks/
Time Published: 2025-11-12T11:00:58Z
Full Content:
Cryptocurrencies linked to real-world assets (RWAs) are drawing scrutiny, as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently warned that these innovations might introduce new risks for investors. In a report released on Tuesday, the global securities regulator highlighted that while many risks associated with tokenization fall under existing regulatory frameworks, new vulnerabilities may arise from the technology itself. Tokenization—essentially the creation of blockchain-based tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks or bonds—has gained renewed interest throughout the year. New tokenized products are increasingly being marketed to the public via online brokers. Tuang Lee Lim, chair of IOSCO’s board-level fintech taskforce, noted that while adoption levels remain modest, tokenization could fundamentally transform the issuance, trading, and servicing of financial assets. However, the regulator’s report points that the diverse ways in which tokenized assets are structured could create confusion for investors, leaving them uncertain about whether they own the underlying asset or merely the crypto token. Additionally, the existence of third-party token issuers adds layers of counterparty risk, a concern echoed by the European Union’s (EU) securities regulator in a similar report from September. IOSCO also cautioned that this new “vulnerability” could be exacerbated by increasing connections to the broader crypto asset market. Despite these risks, some mainstream financial institutions, including Nasdaq, are moving forward with tokenization initiatives. Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, remarked that tokenization offers an alternative method for holding assets like gold in a digital wallet, allowing for 24/7 trading and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers. He added that such innovations could serve as collateral for loans, offering a protective hedge against the depreciation of the US dollar. However, concerns persist among other Wall Street players. Although there has been rising commercial interest in tokenization, the International Organization of Securities Commissions pointed out that actual adoption remains limited. Proponents of tokenized assets argue that blockchain technology can reduce trading costs, expedite settlement times, and attract a younger demographic of investors. However, IOSCO cautioned that the purported efficiency gains are “inconsistent,” as market participants still rely on traditional market infrastructure to facilitate trading, rather than fully replacing it with blockchain technology. The report criticized issuers for failing to publicly disclose any measurable gains. In the US, the push for tokenization has gained momentum alongside new legislation this year, which has spurred a surge in stablecoin adoption. The crypto industry, along with major Wall Street figures, is eager to mainstream this trend. Vlad Tenev, CEO of crypto trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), recently described tokenization as an unstoppable “freight train.” Meanwhile, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, asserted in a summer newsletter that the concept of tokenization has the potential to revolutionize investing.

Title: ETF Launches Are Outpacing Closures. Can the Momentum Last?

Time Published: 2025-11-12T11:00:00Z

Roughly the same number of ETFs closed in the first half of 2024 and 2025, even as new product launches pick up speed. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com What goes up, must come down. Or so it would seem. It’s no secret that ETF launches have exploded this year, with nearly 800 new funds hitting the market in the first nine months of 2025 alone, already ahead of last year’s total of 746. Asset flows have also climbed, with net year-to-date sales topping $1.1 trillion last month. On the other hand, closures have largely remained steady, with 266 funds shuttering in the first half of this year, compared with 253 in the first half of last year, according to ETFGI. But, experts said those numbers could rise as new products struggle to gain the assets needed to survive. “Am I concerned that there’s too many products coming out, and that some of them are going to close? Yes,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF trends research at VettaFi. “BlackRock or any other asset manager is not closing a popular ETF because they have too many of them. They’re pulling inventory off the shelf that isn’t selling to make room for something more likely to sell.” Despite issuers launching funds left and right, there’s reason to believe that new assets can keep up, at least for now. Certain strategies are more popular than others, with areas like spot bitcoin having more success because of the sheer amount of investor interest, said Greg Stumm, president and CEO of American Beacon Advisors. “There are 11 of these [spot bitcoin ETFs], and I’d originally thought that by this time, you’d have seen half of them close. But even the smaller ones are $500 million dollars,” Stumm said. Still, spaces that aren’t the size of crypto will see closures. “If you’re running the same product as someone else, how are you going to see that delta?” Stumm added. According to ETFGI, closures have been roughly on par with prior years: Circle of Life: Although they can be an inconvenience for investors, closures are part of the natural rhythm of the ETF industry, Rosenbluth said. It’s more of an opportunity cost for issuers to run unpopular or unprofitable funds. “Marketing efforts, sales efforts, listing fees: There are costs to running an ETF,” he added. “If you’ve got something waiting in the wings … it’s prudent to take something off the shelf and put something new on.” About 900 ETFs launched this year, and dozens of highly leveraged and spot crypto products await approval. Not all of them will catch on. Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry. The company, which is planning to add mutual fund share classes to some of its ETFs, recently rebranded and put the State Street name on many ETFs while taking SPDR off of some. More than half of millennial ETF investors told Schwab that they can and will outperform boring old index funds. While far from the biggest ETFs on the market, spaced-themed funds are skyrocketing in 2025. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. © 2025 The Daily Upside

November 12, 2025 03:01 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. New ODM Self-Certification Program, Open Networking Initiative, and Open Source Software Contributions Fuel Flexible, Adaptable Private Clouds New and Expanded Collaborations Announced with Cisco, Intel, OVHcloud, SNUC and Supermicro PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) announced it is advancing an open, extensible ecosystem for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), enabling customers to build, connect, protect, and extend their modern private clouds. With these announcements, Broadcom is delivering a private cloud platform that is open and adaptable across all infrastructure layers. Customers will have increased ability to leverage their preferred data center and edge hardware infrastructure, open networking constructs, and open source technologies for on-prem and hosted private cloud environments, while VCF partners will have more opportunity for innovation. “The momentum behind VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is undeniable. It's a platform that's redefining how organizations approach their private cloud journey, offering a consistent operating model that spans data centers to the edge,” said Paul Turner, Chief Product Officer, VMware Cloud Foundation Division, Broadcom. “By fostering an open VCF ecosystem, we're empowering businesses to build modern private clouds that align with their strategic needs, ensuring they can leverage the technologies required for their unique environments.” Open Hardware Ecosystem Enables Flexibility and Choice for Modern Private Cloud DeploymentsBroadcom is expanding its open hardware certification program to increase Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) participation through new VCF AI ReadyNodes, ODM self-service certification, and support for new edge systems. “Supermicro is excited to be among the first hardware OEMs to certify our industry-leading GPU systems as VCF AI ReadyNodes,” said Ismail Sayeeduddin, Vice President, Business Development, Supermicro. “This milestone gives customers a clear migration path from previously certified Supermicro systems in the VMware certification program to the latest fully validated and optimized GPU solutions that help eliminate the cost and complexity of AI adoption.” “Broadcom's open certification program for VCF Ready hardware supports our vertical integration strategy, enabling us to self-certify our server systems for VMware Cloud Foundation,” said Yaniv Fdida, chief product and technology officer for OVHcloud. “This will reinforce our commitment to deliver our customers with competitive, high-performance private cloud services that remain cost-effective. Broadcom’s program will help accelerate our time-to-market for innovative and secure cloud solutions powered by VMware technology, further solidifying our position as a leading global cloud player.” “Broadcom's expansion of the ReadyNode certification program accelerates the deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 platforms,” said Caitlin Anderson, Corporate Vice President, Americas Sales at Intel Corporation. “This combination delivers greater hardware consolidation and cost optimization, which, when delivered through certified configurations, directly enables AI adoption via faster infrastructure modernization.” “The pairing of purpose-built SNUC extremeEDGE servers with VMware Cloud Foundation will enable customers across industries to deliver the edge of tomorrow,” said Steve Savage, chief operating officer at SNUC. “Through self-certification of extremeEDGE as part of Broadcom’s expanded ReadyNode program, we will deliver our edge innovations faster, helping our mutual customers across industrial manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and the federal government maximize the value of AI.” Open Networking to Simplify Private Cloud Deployments with EVPN FabricsBroadcom is announcing a new strategy to unify network fabrics and simplify networking operations in the modern private cloud through standards-based EVPN and BGP networking. This strategy will enhance interoperability between application environments and the network, promoting cloud-like simplicity. The open standards approach will accelerate deployments, enable multi-vendor flexibility, and preserve existing network investments. Customers will benefit from VPC level protection, consistent network operations, routing, and visibility across VCF Networking (NSX) domains and third-party networking solutions, enabling unified operations with end-to-end fabric-driven automation. This approach aligns VCF and Cisco’s Nexus One fabric solution, promoting more consistent and reliable outcomes for mutual Cisco and VCF customers across data center fabric architectural design choices. Cisco’s unified Nexus One fabric approach implements a standard-based VXLAN EVPN control plane and data plane. With VCF’s move towards EVPN-based interoperability and a unified and open architecture, customers can drive faster innovation, shorten time to value, and lower total cost of ownership as VCF extends to the Cisco Nexus One fabric solution. “Cisco's foundational work in VxLAN EVPN, backed by the industry's most comprehensive IETF standards authorship, reflects our long-standing commitment to open networking,” said Murali Gandluru, Vice President, Data Center Networking, Cisco. “This collaboration with Broadcom demonstrates our shared commitment to open standards—giving our customers architectural flexibility and choice as they connect, protect and scale both AI and traditional, business-critical workloads.” Additionally, VCF Networking (NSX) supports Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC), an open-source network operating system based on Linux, in customer deployments today. SONiC provides customers with cost reduction by running on multi-vendor, commodity switch hardware, lowering both capital and operational expenses. The modular, containerized architecture accelerates innovation and agility, allowing operators to perform seamless, zero-downtime feature upgrades and rapid component rollbacks. Furthermore, its Linux Foundation and native API support enhances automation and control, to simplify operations and integrate networking management directly into modern, cloud-scale DevOps workflows. Open Source Community Contributions Enable Industry InnovationBroadcom continues to be an active participant in the Kubernetes community as a top five long-term contributor to CNCF, with contributions to projects such as Antrea, Cluster API, ContainerD, Contour, etcd, Harbor and others. Recently, the CNCF launched the Certified Kubernetes AI Conformance Program, a new initiative to standardize AI workloads on Kubernetes and ensure consistent, interoperable infrastructure for organizations moving AI into production. Broadcom is announcing that VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) is now a Certified Kubernetes AI Conformant Platform. This milestone reinforces Broadcom’s commitment to open standards and helps customers innovate freely, knowing their AI platforms are built on a consistent, interoperable foundation. “VMware by Broadcom has been a long-time contributor to CNCF and continues to play a key role in supporting core projects like Kubernetes,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud & Infrastructure at the Linux Foundation. “Their ongoing investment helps keep Kubernetes vendor-neutral and production-ready at scale, especially for newer AI workloads, and is critical for the health of the broader cloud native ecosystem.” Additional Resources About BroadcomBroadcom Inc.

Title: The difficulty of tracking and interpreting AI usage labels
URL: https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/track-ai-usage-dilemmas
Time Published: 2025-11-12T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
by Tom Johnson on Nov 12, 2025 comments categories: ai Tracking and communicating AI usage in docs turns out to be not only challenging technically, but also potentially full of interpretive pitfalls. There seems to be a double-edged sword at work. On the one hand, we want to track the degree to which AI is being used in doc work so we can quantify, measure, and evaluate the impact of AI. On the other hand, if a tech writer calls out that they used AI for a documentation changelist, it might falsely create the impression that AI did all the work, reducing the value of including the human at all. In this post, I'll explore these dilemmas. Reasons to track AI usage Identifying AI-written content improves the review Problems with identifying AI usage AI fluency is an underrated skill Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail Conclusion Works Cited Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. Reasons to track AI usage First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. Identifying AI-written content improves the review There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers. No surprise, 80% of readers wanted news organizations to disclose AI-generation on the articles. But when news organizations added the label, it lowered the reader’s trust in the article. (See Most readers want publishers to label AI-generated articles — but trust outlets less when they do.) Interestingly, the lowered trust was negated when the articles included links to all the sources used. It was reassuraing to see this detail about sources becasue it actually confirmed the effectiveness of a technique I’ve been using. When I write API docs, every time I mention an API element (a method, parameter, etc.), I link the element to its reference docs. I started doing this initially to avoid hallucination—if I can’t find the element in the docs, it might not exist. Adding the links is my validation technique. Sometimes pages can have 30+ links pointing to reference docs. Inadvertently, these links have actually strengthened the ethos of my documentation content. The AI-produced content looks more authoritative and trustworthy with the links. (Granted, each link presents a jumping off point that might discourage readability, but I’m not worried about this because I don’t mind if users jump around.) Do my link-saturated API docs reverse any soured bias from an AI usage label? Reviewers might see the label but then also see links to the API reference material and shrug off any concerns about inaccuracy. So far, it seems that flagging content as AI-generated/assisted can help in tracking metrics and won’t result in reader bias against the content. Sounds good, right? Not so fast. Problems with identifying AI usage Let’s look more deeply at problems that could arise from using the AI label on content. The Nieman research found that for those unfamiliar with how news is written and produced, the AI-generated label didn’t have that much impact compared to those who are more savvy about journalism practices. In other words, the label bothered other journalists a lot more than non-journalists. Applying this to docs, this implies the bias might be worse among fellow tech writers; they’re more likely to view the label as “cheating” or a shortcut. Does this also mean that CEOs and other leaders who have little understanding of documentation work produced by tech writers won’t be bothered by the “AI usage” labels on tech docs? Probably. However, trust isn’t central to my concerns here; rather, valuation of the human element in AI-generated content is. The Nieman research doesn’t tell us whether the readers might be more prone to make interpretive leaps about humans not being necessary to produce docs. Readers might not be bothered by the AI usage label while also believing that tech writers are an unnecessary relic of past processes, and are ready to be shed so that other, non-tech-writer workers can use AI tools to achieve the same results. I want to avoid errantly communicating up the leadership chain that AI is doing my job, rather than me. For example, if a senior leader (who might only have limited understanding of the tech writing role) sees a label on a changelist that says “AI-generated” or similar, with no other qualifiers, they might assume that the tech writer’s input was minimal; AI did this work. This label could promote the following erroneous conclusion: Because this changelist has an AI-generated label, I assume AI created the content. If AI is creating this content, why am I paying a tech writer here? I should instead be buying more AI chips. Conclusion: Let’s reroute the money to AI chips instead of tech writer salaries. This conclusion is dangerously misleading and false. In worst case scenarios, it could make it easier for leaders to lay off tech writers, as with the recent Amazon layoffs. The justification? “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,” says CEO Andy Jassey. (See Amazon to Cut 14,000 White-Collar Jobs.) As I argued in Why long-running tasks autonomously carried out by agentic AI aren’t the future of doc work, and might just be an illusion, tech writers use AI more as a collaborative thought partner rather than providing AI with predefined prompts that agents carry out autonomously. If you look at the corresponding comment thread on Linkedin, other tech writers unanimously agree. In the Jagged Frontier article, this thought partner concept is often described using the “Centaur” metaphor, drawing from Garry Kasparov’s chess finding that a human-machine collaboration process could outperform a strong computer alone. Kasparov explains: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.” (See Effective Generative AI: The Human-Algorithm Centaur). The value isn’t in the human or the AI, but in the process of collaboration, which involves the human and machine working together. I’ve also explored this idea in my post Plurality of AI attitudes and experiences. The key is knowing how to navigate the jagged technological frontier—knowing when to apply AI (where it excels) and when not to (where it fails). Successful users adopt a Centaur approach, strategically dividing tasks between human and machine. (Some also use a “Cyborg” approach, which is a deeper, more granular co-creation.) This strategic collaboration is what’s lost in a simple “AI-generated” label. (Some try to formalize this distinction with terms like “AI-in-the-Loop” (AITL) for human-led work versus “Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL) for AI-led work, but I’m not a huge fan of these labels either.) What might be a more appropriate way to identify AI usage while still communicating the idea that a human heavily steered, directed, edited, and led the output to the shape that it finally took? Perhaps something more narrative, like “I collaborated with AI for 20% of the content here….”? Unfortunately, this creates an epilogue to any article that might be too much detail. There’s no easy answer on how to attribute AI usage. This dilemma also plays out on my blog. How much can I use AI before I need to add a tagline somewhere noting that the content was AI-assisted? For example, if I use AI for brainstorming, general organization, proofreading, identifying logic gaps, splicing in quotes, and more, should I identify the content as AI generated / AI assisted / AI consulted? If I add a note that says I used AI, will readers immediately conclude that AI did all the work? How do I represent the human-in-the-loop factor so that others will understand the human design work that goes into a post? I have used AI in this post. I wrote an initial draft of my thoughts, then plugged this draft into Gemini Deep Research to expand my thinking with more research. After skimming the sources, I used AI to suggest which research might be most relevant to the article, and selected which articles I thought were a good fit. I allowed AI to insert the research into my article. Then I reworked the insertions. I read or reread the articles and used Gemini to ensure my reworked interpretations were accurate. I stumbled upon additional articles and included them, and used Gemini to summarize them in places or check the accuracy of my summaries. I had Gemini do some proofreading as well. Would that kind of explanation in an epilogue satisfy readers? At the end of the day, it’s the final content that matters, right? If something is only AI slop due to the label, and not the actual quality, then we’ve moved into the reader response realm. Ranking the influence of AI is also problematic. If I ask AI to generate a counterargument to this post, and then use that counterargument to address some logic gaps and strengthen my argument, isn’t this a deeper use of AI than simply guiding AI to generate some language that articulates concepts that I roughly communicate to it? It seems like using AI as a thought partner—but then not attributing AI—is more socially acceptable than using AI to help articulate language, even if all the ideas originated from me. In short, deciding on a label that appropriately identifies the AI usage while still attributing and acknowledging the human input and design of the content is no easy matter, and is full of interpretive pitfalls about AI doing more or less work than it deserves. AI fluency is an underrated skill Finally, one last note about the importance of human input. There’s a general assumption that if you use AI, it’s doing the bulk of the work. But in using AI with tech docs and interacting with other tech writers also trying to use AI, I’ve realized that AI fluency is an underrated skill. It requires some know-how and savvy to understand how to manipulate AI tools to achieve documentation goals. Sure, some tasks might be simple, like proofreading a document for obvious grammar errors. But suppose you have a new feature that’s launching, and you have a swath of different documents and sources to draw upon. The path from A (no content) to Z (final content) might involve 20+ conversations with AI tools pursuing different paths, directions, and validations. I provided a sample of the dynamic conversations that take shape in Example of iterative feedback loops. The skill to interact with AI successfully in this situation shouldn’t be underestimated. AI fluency might be equivalent to knowing a programming language. When one tech writer complains about how AI doesn’t help them, that it just leads to more work, errors they have to fix, etc., this makes me wonder what their approach is. Yes, it could be that AI is just tripping over itself and hallucinating left and right. Or it could be an “operator error.” It’s hard to know because I occasionally run into the same frustrations but have many more successes than others. It might help if writers more freely shared their conversation histories with each other. Attaching an AI label to content doesn’t acknowledge the skill of the human input. There’s a lot that goes into content production that might be entirely based on the human-led approach, and which is likely dismissed when you attach the AI usage label. I’ve built up AI fluency skills over the past two years, but when I add “AI-generated” to my content, my human-led guidance of the AI through the dark waters to polished docs is undermined. Instead, the takeaway is, “Oh, AI generated this?” Nuanced labels and rubrics also fail If we start using labels on the pull requests or changelists we create, perhaps the labels could be more nuanced in identifying the human input. Something like this: HUMAN_TO_AI=80/20 This label isn’t immediately obvious and can’t be interpreted at a glance. That’s part of the point. This label reduces the likelihood that someone reads it and concludes that AI did all the work. It also both acknowledges and emphasizes the human input, while still allowing authors to recognize the input of AI. However, this label screams that the writer is trying to promote their human involvement in the process, as if trying to make the case from the label alone. It looks whiny, as if shouting hey, this wasn’t all AI buddy. Further, it presents a false precision about the human-to-AI ratio. This ratio (80/20) is a conceptual trap because it can’t capture the difference between a deeper use (like generating a counterargument) and a shallow one (like proofreading). Suppose you use AI to generate a script that produces an output (such as a script to produce reference docs that include some post-processing magic). What part of that is human versus AI? How do you clarify the various inputs, from brainstorming to organizing information, validating the info, addressing areas of emphasis and hierarchy, and more? This ratio might sound precise, but it’s a ballpark guess at best. It probably shouldn’t be quantified with such precision but be more like T-shirt sizes. But what would that look like? HUMAN_TO_AI=XL/S. You might as well write in another language. Others might argue for using a more complex framework that would sort and rank AI usage across different categories. For example, maybe use a “Centaur attribution matrix” that, rather than using a ratio, classifies the role AI played across different workflow stages (for example, “AI as Tool,” “AI as Consultant,” or “AI as Drafter”). This seems a bit overkill to me, almost requiring more work to identify the different parts of the writing process than is feasible. I’m not sure a complex rubric like this actually solves the problem or would satisfy all my questions. In many ways, the rubric seems like the brainchild of a college composition instructor grading essays along 5 categories with different choices in each. When did writers ever find value in getting feedback in a rubric of check boxes? Conclusion Overall, this obsession with labels might just be a distraction. Perhaps the metrics might speak for themselves. If you’re consistently delivering accurate, high-quality content and demonstrating an accelerated productivity, those might be the only metrics that matter—not a label that attempts (and fails) to capture the complex, human-led processes behind it.

Spoiler alert: The conclusion doesn’t include any definitive solutions. It instead focuses on expanding discussions about the tradeoffs. For a short video (7 min.) of this post, see this NotebookLM video. First, let’s talk about the need to track AI usage. I’d like to track AI usage so that I can answer some basic questions: Is AI speeding up the time it takes me to write docs? If so, by how much? Being able to answer this question seems important to justifying the enormous spend in AI happening right now. Occasionally, I run across critics of AI, and although I have an intuitive sense that AI is helping me be more productive, I don’t have solid data to rely on. There are plenty of naysayers who argue that they spend just as much time fixing errors from AI as they might save time using AI. Who’s right and who’s wrong? There are some studies that point to quantitative productivity gains from AI. For example, in Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier,, researchers gave users tasks like conceptualizing and developing a new footwear product, and also using data and notes to make a recommendation. In cases where AI was appropriate to use, the participants improved the quality by 40% and completed tasks 25% faster. But in areas where AI wasn’t effective, the output worsened—those participants scored 19% worse in a quality and correctness measure. The study’s findings don’t just emphasize time savings from AI, but the nuances of knowing when to use AI and when to use your human skills. This kind of study is helpful. But given the variety of documentation scenarios—the different skills and domain expertise levels of the writers, the varieties of tools (some of which might be much more suitable than others), the models (which fluctuate every month), time constraints (under the gun for a release?), reviewers (some are stringent, others disinterested)—all these factors might skew quantitative results one way or another, so much that it’s probably impossible to arrive at any conclusion that argues that AI improves documentation by a certain quality score and speeds up task completion by a specific amount. It’s all intuitive guessing. Similar to the MIT study, a McKinsey study focusing on software development found that generative AI can boost productivity. Developers using generative AI tools completed coding tasks up to twice as fast, with time savings in areas like code documentation (cut in half) and writing new code (cut by nearly half). Again, this study doesn’t focus on writing docs, but it’s probably closer than the previous one. Importantly, the research found that code quality was marginally better when developers actively collaborated with the tools. This suggests that the technology is best used to augment human effort rather than replace it (something I argued at length in my previous post on long-running tasks). However, the study also noted that time savings shrank significantly for highly complex tasks and among less experienced developers. I work on tech docs all day, so it would seem I could at least draw upon more extensive analyses of my own work. Why are more definitive, in-house metrics so elusive? Why can’t a group of AI-focused tech writers make a persuasive argument company-wide that draws upon actual data that tech writers in that company have culled, analyzed, and vetted? Alas, it seems like a problem that is tough to solve, so we currently rely on external studies like the ones mentioned. There’s another reason to track AI usage. Calling out AI usage in a changelist (or pull request) can help alert reviewers that they should be extra careful in their review. Knowing that someone used AI to generate content can be valuable context. As a reviewer, I might be more apt to look suspiciously at confident-sounding statements. Since I want the reviewer to carefully validate the content (errors are never good in docs), I’ll accept the potentially negative bias from the AI label rather than risk a cursory review and higher risk of errors slipping into production. Within corporations, there’s a strong encouragement to use AI, so adding an “AI used” label isn’t generally seen as “cheating” or skirting quality like it might be interpreted elsewhere (such as in academia). However, there is an undeniable bias that gets injected whenever you flag something as AI-written, no matter if you’re in an academic or corporate context. In the worst case, the bias is something like this: Oh, this was written by AI? I’ll expect total incoherent crap, I guess. The AI-generated label really can sour readers right from the start, thanks to all the AI slop floating around. This perceived bias isn’t just a feeling; research from Neiman Journalism Lab confirms it, but with a twist. They looked at the effect of how adding AI-generated labels to news affected readers.

You've probably noticed that many people are saying we're in an AI bubble. "OpenAI's Sam Altman sees AI bubble forming," CNBC reports. "Fears of an AI bubble are growing," NBC News states. "AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All," Wired announces. "Mark Zuckerberg says a ‘collapse’ is ‘definitely a possibility,’" Fortune declares. You've probably also noticed that almost everyone who uses the term “AI bubble” starts to sound very boring and confusing immediately afterward. This is because the people who bring up the AI bubble tend to be market analysts, and most market analysts would rather have potatoes growing inside their bodies than talk like a normal person for four seconds. So what is an AI bubble? Are we in one? How scared should you be? What happens if the artificial intelligence industry blows a trillion-dollar hole in the non-artificial economy? What happens if it doesn't? Let's walk through this thing together. Yes. Because the gigantic numbers floating around the AI economy—deals worth trillions, data centers costing tens of billions, 75 percent of gains in the S&P 500 centered on AI stocks—are almost entirely driven by hype, and the hype has come unglued from reality. The hype around AI insists that it's a world-transforming technology that will revolutionize every aspect of human society. The reality, which we'll explore in more detail in a second, is that AI companies are burning through staggering amounts of money (and fossil fuels) with no clear path to profitability, that the companies themselves aren't super clear about what their products are for, and that many of those products have failed to perform in the applications they've been assigned to (AI search engines return inaccurate information, AI teachers impair learning, AI therapists make mental health worse). Worse yet for the industry, the biggest players are increasingly tied up in time-bomb financial deals that look disastrous for their futures in any but the rosiest of best-case scenarios. But because the hype around AI is so pervasive—who doesn't want to own a chunk of the technology that will determine every aspect of humanity's future?—investors have continued plowing money into the field despite the warning signs, sending stock prices into orbit. As of last week, Nvidia, the leading AI chipmaker, is the first company in history whose stock is priced at over $5 trillion in total—meaning this one individual company accounts for roughly 8 percent of the S&P 500. That's a bubble. Plain English Tackles the AI Bubble Everybody Thinks AI Is a Bubble. What If They’re Wrong? This Is How the AI Bubble Could Burst Is AI Really About to Solve Human Disease? Plain English Tackles the AI Bubble Everybody Thinks AI Is a Bubble. What If They’re Wrong? This Is How the AI Bubble Could Burst Is AI Really About to Solve Human Disease? It's what happens when the price people are willing to pay for a thing exceeds the value of the thing by some drastically untenable amount. It's hard to give a more technical definition, because determining the correct value of anything is weirdly tricky beyond a certain point. Markets, for all that people pretend otherwise, are extremely susceptible to vibes. Past bubbles have inflated around everything from tulips to Japanese real estate to the original wave of dot-com stocks in the early 2000s, but let's run with a simpler example. Say there's a new hype sneaker. It costs $18 to manufacture, it retails for $100, and it's going for $1,800 on StockX. What's its correct value? Everyone can kinda sense that $1,800 is too much to pay for it, but the price keeps going up, so people keep snapping up more pairs, often hoarding multiples in the hope of flipping them for a profit. The price hits $2,000. Then, suddenly, a guy gets nervous and sells 10 pairs for a little less than the current max. People notice this and start selling off their own pairs for whatever they can get before the price craters. By the end of the next day, the bubble's popped. The price is down to $150. People who held their pairs take a massive loss; people who flip sneakers full time have spent a fortune and can't sell their current pairs for enough to refresh their inventory. Why did the price spike? Because people convinced themselves it made sense to spend that much. Why did the price collapse? Because the people who collectively propped up the delusion that the price made sense got spooked and decided to get out with what they could before everyone else decided it didn't. It means that the AI industry's most important product at this moment is not a chatbot or a video generator; it's the story the AI industry is telling about itself. There's a saying stock market people pass around: "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." The market is definitely irrational right now; the goal of the AI industry is to keep it irrational until the industry can figure out a way around the mess it's created for itself. How bad is the mess? OpenAI's ChatGPT, by far the most successful generative AI product to date, requires so much expensive computing power to run that it loses money almost every time you use it. (For the first half of 2025, OpenAI took in $4.3 billion in income and still reported a net loss of $13.5 billion.) A recent Deutsche Bank report says that the AI boom is "unsustainable." Bain & Co.'s annual global technology report says the AI industry will need $2 trillion in annual revenue by 2030 to continue at its current rate. (That number will be, um, hard to come by.) A Bank of England report warns that the market could experience a "sharp correction" due to the overvaluation of AI companies. Companies with no clear plan for making money from AI have poured cash into the construction of data centers so massive that they're straining the electrical grid and driving up the price of electricity for the rest of us. They've poured cash into what's called "compute"—processing power, basically, used to train AI models and run search queries—at a rate they can't keep up unless the entire world economy reorganizes itself around their products by, like, Tuesday. All that tech has a shelf life, just as your iPhone does; the industry will have to keep spending ruinous sums every few years to replace it. And to keep the ball in the air, the companies have made a number of increasingly bizarre, shady, and circular deals with each other: Nvidia, for instance, has invested $100 billion in OpenAI, which OpenAI must then turn around and spend on Nvidia products. If I give your lemonade stand $10 so you can buy my $10 lemons, we can't tell our investors (your mom) that we've boosted the lemonade economy by $20. But that's the kind of reasoning that fuels more and more of Silicon Valley's grandiose claims about itself. The thing is, though, the price of a stock is not determined by the soundness of the company. It's determined by the willingness of investors to pay a certain price. And there are ways to convince investors to pay high prices for shares even when it means driving through an endless series of flashing red lights. If you can, say, leverage three decades of mythmaking about the transformative impact of the tech industry by convincing a compliant press to spread the word that your new product is poised to make every sci-fi dream a reality—cure cancer, bring humanity to other planets, create flying cars—then the sheer size of the vision you're peddling might convince investors to buy in, even if doing so seems reckless. Tech investors, especially the superrich ones, are always in the market for stories scaled to their egos, and their egos are getting more messianic all the time. And in the era of crypto and Robinhood, regular idiots like us increasingly see the stock market as a casino. Pushing some chips onto the new, hot, famous, sexy thing seems way more exciting than researching the fundamentals of some well-run company no one's talking about. Plus, everyone else is doing it. OpenAI is currently targeting a $1 trillion IPO. The basis of that number is not—like, extremely not—the solid state of the business. It's the story the company is telling. Talking a big game has thus become the essential and necessary activity of AI companies. (This includes acknowledging the possibility of a bubble as a form of panic mitigation: That way, if the bubble does pop, the wise, patient tech CEOs can say they expected it all along.) AI storytelling is an amalgam of several different narratives, including: As far as I can make out, the scheme is essentially: Keep the ship floating for as long as possible, keep inhaling as much capital as possible, and maybe the tech will get somewhere that justifies the absurd valuations, or maybe we'll worm our way so far into the government that it'll have to bail us out, or maybe some other paradigm-altering development will fall from the sky. And the way to keep the ship floating is to keep peddling the vision and to seem more confident that the dream is inevitable the less it appears to be coming true. Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Fatherhood and Forgiveness With Roy Wood Jr. Plus, Ed Zitron Breaks Down the “AI Bubble.” Yes. Last week, as Nvidia was crossing the $5 trillion threshold—making the chip manufacturer worth approximately as much as the gross domestic products of France and South Korea combined—several of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies released their earnings reports. It was a sensitive moment for big tech. All year, murmurs of a bubble had been growing louder. Deutsche Bank called summer 2025 "the summer AI turned ugly." A series of bad earnings reports could have triggered a major sell-off. The air over Northern California could have echoed with a hollow popping sound. Instead, the earnings reports were … OK? Alphabet, Google's parent company, notched its first $100 billion quarter. Microsoft beat expectations. Meta's stock slid after it announced a one-time tax charge, but not drastically. No bubbles were seriously threatened. If you looked a little more closely, though, there were further signs of strain in the industry. Microsoft's stock slid 5 percent immediately after its earnings call, which analysts interpreted as a sign that the market is mildly freaked out about how much money the company is plowing into AI infrastructure. ("The vibe is cautious," TheTradable reported.) The companies were a little vague about how much revenue they're actually bringing in from AI, or how they expect to make money from it. Zuckerberg, defending the vast sums Meta is pouring into its data centers, unwittingly summed up the uncertain mood when he said that this kind of infrastructure spending "is very likely to be a profitable thing over … over some period." Pretty bad, man! On paper, at least, the ungodly sums AI companies are spending on their infrastructure are propping up the American economy almost single-handedly. In the first half of 2025, spending on data centers accounted for most of the economic growth in the U.S., outpacing all consumer spending combined. (You'll see this reported in ways that make it sound as if the economy is being bolstered by the money AI companies are making, but no, it's the money they're spending that's relevant.) On the other hand, "on paper" may not be the best way to understand the state of the U.S. economy right now. It's been widely observed that many regular people feel the economy is bad, while economists, when they look at the numbers, say it's relatively strong. This disparity is probably in part because, on paper, Meta dumping a thousand trillion dollars into a Death Star–sized “superintelligence lab” with 11 employees in rural Idaho boosts the numbers, but in reality, Zuckerberg's real estate binges have a limited effect on conditions outside the semi-closed loop of the AI industry. (This may be especially true now that private equity funds are getting involved in data center financing.) Groceries are getting more expensive. Utilities are getting more expensive. Thanks to the Trump tariffs, almost everything we buy is getting more expensive. None of that is offset by AI investment, and if AI investment stopped tomorrow, the immediate impact on many people's daily lives might be less than you'd expect. That also applies to, as you might guess, non-AI businesses, many of which are also struggling. Many have scrambled to incorporate AI into their operations, drawn by the promise of a technology that would cut labor costs and revolutionize productivity. Yet according to an MIT study released in August, 95 percent of businesses that have deployed generative AI have gotten no value from it. It's not clear that the AI bubble bursting would have a devastating effect on them either, at least directly. Indirectly, of course, things look quite different. A sharp contraction in tech would put tens of thousands of people out of work, vaporize trillions of investment dollars, torpedo retirement and education funds, obliterate life savings, and ruin lives. It would be a violent shock to a system that's already under strain. Of course, one of the reasons the economy is under strain is the massive concentration of wealth in the hands of a small number of oligarchs, and those same oligarchs would like to use AI to replace the human labor force—likely putting tens of thousands of people out of work, vaporizing non-oligarchic wealth, obliterating savings, etc. It may be better for the world for the bubble to pop, whatever damage is done. For now, though, we are living in the storytelling economy. As long as the shared fantasy of the AI industry holds Silicon Valley and its investors in thrall, the reckoning can be deferred. And in the meantime, who knows? Maybe the bubble will never pop. Maybe the people who've sold the fantasy can figure out how to keep us believing long enough for someone to create it, or at least to dream up a new one and hope we don't notice the difference. It's bitterly funny, though, that up until now, some of the biggest victims of AI companies have been the artists, writers, actors, and filmmakers whose creative work the companies want to cannibalize and replace. The industry has shown nothing but contempt for narrative art that speaks to the human imagination—the very thing that's keeping it alive.

Title: 10 Proven Vacation Rental Marketing Ideas for 2025 (That Actually Drive Bookings)

Time Published: 2025-11-12T05:43:24Z

Get our Design Ideas in your inbox! Sign up U.S. short-term-rental demand jumped about seven percent in 2024, yet supply lagged—so every booking now counts. Travelers still crave one-of-a-kind stays, which means generic marketing won’t cut it. That’s why we built this playbook. It ranks ten battle-tested tactics by impact, cost, and effort. Each move works on a lean budget, scales from a single cabin to 50 condos, and typically pays for itself within 90 days. Pick the tactic that matches your goals, layer on the rest, and keep your 2025 calendar packed. U.S. short-term-rental demand climbed seven percent in 2024, while active listings grew about five percent, a gap wide enough to keep rates healthy yet narrow enough to sharpen competition. (help.airdna.co) According to AirDNA, the supply surge that began during the pandemic is still visible. Non-professional hosts saw occupancy dip to roughly 54 percent in early 2024 before edging back toward 55 percent by mid-2025—evidence that guests now have more choice. Statista projects vacation-rental revenue to exceed about $105 billion in 2025. With demand still outrunning new supply in many drive-to markets, you can secure a larger slice without overspending, a theme we explore next. Rental-industry analysts at Rental Scale-Up note that Airbnb’s search model now weighs more than 800 signals and puts extra weight on booking probability plus guest-satisfaction cues such as transparent fees and replies in under an hour. Vrbo and Booking.com are rolling out similar quality-score updates that lift listings most likely to convert. Across U.S. markets, one in four reservations now lands within five days of arrival, down from one in six in 2022, AirDNA data show. Remote workers and multigenerational groups often decide mid-week and travel the same weekend, so outdated minimum-stay or pricing rules can leave revenue on the table. Two- to four-bedroom homes sit in the sweet spot for last-minute demand, and large groups now feel comfortable booking a 10-person getaway just two weeks out, according to AirDNA’s STR Data Lab podcast. Expect jagged occupancy patterns instead of tidy week-long blocks. New York City’s Local Law 18 blocks OTAs from processing reservations at unregistered homes, cutting thousands of listings since full enforcement began in September 2023. In Dallas, a 2023 ban on short-term rentals in single-family zones remains on hold after a 2025 appeals-court decision, creating a patchwork of “allowed but unsettled” neighborhoods. If you watch these moving parts and adjust pricing, policies, and marketing in real time, you stay visible. Coast, and you risk vanishing from search and local maps. We started with four must-haves. To rank each idea, we built a Priority Score: Impact × 2 – Cost – Difficulty. We then color-coded the results (green 🟢, amber 🟡, red 🔴) so you can adjust weights to fit your goals and skills. With the scorecard set, the first idea shows why professional marketing help can secure more nights on the calendar. Great marketing depends on three scarce resources: time, technology, and continuous tuning. When you already juggle guest messages, turnovers, and repairs, outsourcing growth to a professional team can free up evenings and lift revenue. Full-service vacation-rental managers bundle multi-channel distribution, dynamic pricing, and professional photography. SkyRun Vacation Rentals manages thousands of homes across North America’s most-loved destinations and uses centralized systems to publish one listing to Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and Google while syncing calendars and adjusting rates as demand shifts. Their centralized systems publish one listing to Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and Google, sync calendars, and adjust rates as demand shifts. AirDNA reports that managed listings earned 15–20 percent more revenue year over year than comparable self-hosted homes, comfortably covering a typical 20 percent commission. Real-world proof: an AirDNA case study found that Phoenix-area manager Venture REI used data-driven pricing and wider channel reach to raise one owner’s occupancy from 72 percent to 92 percent in a single quarter. If you consider a partner, vet them the way guests vet you. Ask for transparent performance reports, local market knowledge, and clear service tiers. A good manager works like a revenue coach, sharing data that shows exactly how each booking reaches your bank account. Property type + standout feature + key amenity + location cue Example: Lakefront cabin w/ private dock, dog-friendly. Clear language earns the click. AirDNA’s content review shows that listings between 250 and 350 words convert 12 percent better than very short or very long blurbs. Guide readers from arrival to bedtime, weaving in sensory details plus quick answers on parking, Wi-Fi speed, and fees. Update photos each season, adjust the title for local events, and trim outdated lines. Frequent edits nudge you up in search results and signal care to returning guests. Relying on one OTA is like putting all your savings in a single stock; one algorithm tweak or city rule can cut cash flow overnight. A multi-channel plan spreads risk and reaches new demand. Travelnest reports that hosts who diversify beyond their primary site gain up to 30 percent more bookings year-round. Different sites reach different travelers: A channel manager such as Rentals United or Guesty for Hosts syncs rates, rules, and availability in real time. That prevents double bookings and lets you fine-tune prices by channel. One Rentals United case study recorded a 40 percent lift in occupancy after expanding to new channels with automated sync. Aim for the big four—Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, Google—plus one or two niche or regional sites that match your ideal guest. Keep photos, pricing, and policies consistent to build trust with travelers and search algorithms, and you stay visible even if one platform stumbles. Major OTAs keep 10–15 percent of every reservation as commission. Airbnb’s host-only fee rises to 15.5 percent for software-connected listings in October 2025, and Booking.com already averages about 15 percent. That slice of revenue disappears, and you also lose the guest’s email, upsell options, and control over ranking. A direct path on your own site flips the math. You keep the commission, own the contact list, and shield your business from sudden policy changes that can freeze an OTA account. Pass part of the saved fee back to travelers—a five-percent lower nightly rate or free early check-in—and you stay cheaper than your OTA listing while pocketing the same margin. TouchStay notes that hosts who convert just 20 percent of stays to direct save thousands in annual fees, smoothing seasonality and trimming ad spend over time. Think of your site as the property’s digital front door. It needs only four elements: Most hosts launch a direct site through their property-management system or a WordPress template. Connect Stripe or Square, upload professional photos, and you can go live in a weekend. Next, publish two evergreen blog posts that solve travel-planning headaches—“Best kid-friendly hikes near Gatlinburg” or “Where to park for Mardi Gras.” End each post with a soft “check availability” link. Finally, reward past guests for booking direct: offer a five-percent repeat-stay discount or free late checkout in your post-departure email. Small perks chip away at OTA dependence with every return visit. Static nightly rates are guesses. Dynamic pricing tools track live signals such as local events, competitor rates, and booking windows, then refresh prices every day. Rates rise the moment a festival sells out and drop mid-week to keep occupancy steady. Getting started is simple. Connect a service like PriceLabs, Wheelhouse, or Beyond, set your floor and stretch targets, and let the algorithm handle the dials. Beyond users report 10–15 percent higher annual revenue after switching from manual pricing. The lift shows up two ways: average daily rate climbs on peak nights, while occupancy improves in shoulder seasons when the tool lowers prices to capture last-minute stays. Review your pricing calendar weekly to spot odd spikes, and adjust minimum-stay rules to two nights in low season and three or four when demand is high to balance turnover costs. With pricing on autopilot, you can focus on guest experience instead of spreadsheets and out-earn neighbors who still set one price and hope for the best. New guests cost money, whether it’s commissions, ads, or hours of messaging. Past guests cost almost nothing. Hostfully’s 2024 Hospitality Report shows that repeat guests generate 33 percent higher lifetime value and need 50 percent less marketing spend. Staying in their inbox keeps that value flowing. Build the list on checkout day. Export the reservation, tag it “opt-in,” and drop the address into a free platform such as Mailchimp. Email once a quarter. TouchStay recommends quarterly cadence for short-term rentals; more frequent sends feel spammy when travelers book only once or twice a year. Highlight one upgrade (new firepit), two local events, and an early-bird deal, such as 10 percent off spring dates booked by February. Segment for relevance. Families who stayed in July care about school-break deals; remote workers from November want winter monthly rates. Most PMS tools auto-label stays by party size and season, so filtering takes minutes. Add a loyalty hook. “Book direct next time and enjoy free early check-in” costs nothing most days and signals VIP status. Track perks in a spreadsheet and deliver on arrival; 64 percent of operators already use special offers to secure repeat stays. Stack these quick emails to stay top of mind, fill shoulder-season gaps, and cut dependence on paid channels. Travel dreaming starts on phones long before it reaches Google. Forty percent of leisure travelers say social media sparks their trip ideas, and Guesty notes that listings for a well-prepared vacation rental property with an active feed earn 37 percent more bookings than silent ones. The cost is mostly your time, not cash. Pick one or two channels that match your audience. Instagram reels wow couples searching “best sunset Airbnb,” Facebook still guides multigenerational planners, and TikTok’s travel hashtag passed 40 billion views in 2025. Post twice a week: one glossy shot and one slice-of-life clip, such as marshmallows toasting at your firepit or a five-second dawn timelapse on the lake. Guest photos bring built-in trust. Encourage tags, reshare with a thank-you, and add a gentle direct-booking link. Over time your feed turns into a gallery of real memories future guests can picture themselves in. Need a faster boost? Team up with a micro-influencer who fits your locale, perhaps a regional food blogger or adaptive-travel creator. Offer a mid-week comp night and list clear deliverables: one post, one story, usage rights. For owners who’d rather outsource the whole social-media and ad-buying lift, this guide to vacation-rental marketing services breaks down what a specialist agency can handle—from photo shoots to multi-channel campaigns—so you can scale visibility without adding hours to your schedule. Focused audiences beat celebrity scatter and often cost less than one vacant night. Social will not replace OTAs, but it widens the funnel and supplies fresh visuals for your website and listings, content that keeps working long after the likes fade. Reviews do more than reassure travelers; they push you higher in search results. Airbnb factors ratings volume and recency into ranking, while Vrbo’s new “Loved by Guests” badge lifts homes with 9.4-plus average scores and verified photo reviews. Yet Airbnb data show that fewer than half of guests leave a review unless you prompt them. Ask quickly and personally. Send a text within 24 hours of checkout that mentions one detail from the stay: “Glad the kids loved the game room!” Then make the request. Guesty reports that personalized prompts raise review rates by 30 percent over generic automations. Fix first, then ask. Resolve any issue before requesting feedback; future guests judge how you handle hiccups as much as the hiccup itself. Showcase micro-quotes. Drop three-word gems such as “spotlessly clean” or “views for days” into your listing description, website hero copy, and social captions. Snippets deliver social proof where star icons do not appear. Expand the footprint. After an OTA review posts, invite guests to paste the same text on Google Business Profile or Facebook. More review sites mean more pathways for search engines—and travelers—to reach you. Over time, plentiful, authentic feedback becomes the moat that keeps competitors at bay. Organic reach goes far, yet some nights still need a paid boost, such as mid-week gaps or shoulder-season lulls. Hyper-targeted ads place your listing in front of travelers already hunting for the dates you must fill, and you can pause spend once the gap is gone. A Google campaign around “pet-friendly cabin Blue Ridge” shows only to people typing those words. WordStream’s 2024 Google Ads benchmark report indicates travel-sector CPCs average $1.92 and convert at 6–8 percent. Meta lets you filter by interests, income, and even relationship status, so a beach condo can pitch “babymoon getaway” packages to expectant parents within a four-hour drive. The same benchmark data put Facebook’s travel CPC at about $0.51, and retargeting nudges yesterday’s site visitors toward tomorrow’s bookings. Channel Best use case Avg. CPC Key metric Google Search High-intent gaps under 30 days $1.90 Cost per booking Meta (FB/IG) Awareness and retargeting $0.51 View-through bookings TikTok Visual, younger audience $0.80–$1.20* Video watch rate *Early-2025 TikTok Travel advertisers report sub-$1 CPCs in U.S. drive-to markets (internal ad-network data). Start small at about $10 a day, one campaign, and one audience. Send clicks to your direct-booking page so the first stay covers the ad and future stays arrive commission-free. If a channel fails to return at least three times its cost, pause it and test a new angle. Paid ads should regulate cash flow smoothly, not drain it. Use CRM tags to spot work-from-anywhere guests and email a remote-ready bundle: verified 300 Mbps Wi-Fi, spare monitor, mid-stay cleaning. For families, swap in a stroller rental and a map of free playgrounds. Speaking each guest’s language turns price into a footnote and fuels glowing reviews. Partner with a local yoga teacher for sunrise deck sessions or stock s’mores kits plus a star map at the firepit. TouchStay’s 2024 Guest Sentiment Report shows that low-cost add-ons lift review scores by 0.3 stars on average. Higher ratings feed the algorithm and justify a modest rate bump no neighbor can copy overnight. Block one afternoon each month to activate a new AI feature, send a segment-specific email, or test a micro-experience. Track bookings or review scores for 30 days. Keep what moves the needle, drop what does not. Guests feel the momentum, algorithms reward relevance, and your calendar fills while others cling to last year’s checklist.

Title: Amazon cuts 700 jobs in NYC alone on quest to streamline by slashing 30,000 positions

Amazon’s massive October layoffs included 660 terminations in Manhattan, according to New York State government records. The ax fell on nine office addresses affecting corporate employees only, Amazon confirmed. Two sites bore the brunt of the local cuts. The e-commerce giant’s 450 W. 33rd St. offices near Hudson Yards were hit with 233 layoffs, while its 424 Fifth Ave. offices at the former Lord & Taylor flagship — which Amazon bought in 2020 for $1 billion — saw 182 terminations, according to Monday filings from the state Department of Labor. “I believe the vast majority of these cuts are tech layoffs for Amazon and NYC was not spared,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told The Post. “The size of the Amazon cuts remains a head scratcher given the battle for talent and [the] AI revolution in motion.” Amazon declined to share details of the cuts but said warehouse and delivery workers weren’t among those laid off. Late last month, the Seattle-based tech titan said it was eliminating 14,000 staffers as part of restructuring. The move was aimed at “reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets,” wrote Beth Galetti, senior VP of people experience in a blog post on Oct. 28. The company is reportedly planning to slash a total of 30,000 corporate jobs in the latest round of cuts – or about 9% of its global office-based workforce, sources told Reuters. The layoffs are expected to continue in January, after the holiday shopping season, according to a New York Times report. Amazon has slashed tens of thousands of jobs since Andy Jassy took over the helm from the company’s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, in 2021. Amazon typically employs thousands of workers at its locations and none of the nine offices that saw layoffs in New York City is expected to close. As of 2023, Amazon employed 2,000 people inside the grand old Lord & Taylor building where the tech company established its “New York Tech Hub.” The 11-story, Italian Renaissance Revival tower boasts a landscaped rooftop with trees, an indoor dining area and even a dog run. Amazon’s recent New York City layoffs include 91 jobs at 410 Tenth Ave, 58 positions at 7 W. 34th St., 41 jobs at 330 W. 34th St., 38 jobs at 237 Park Ave., nine jobs at 315 Park Ave. S, seven at 215 Park Ave. S. and one unlucky person at 6 W. 35th St., according to public records. “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Galetti wrote last month. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Advertisement

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Chip Stocks Slide as SoftBank Sells Nvidia Stake; Paramount Skydance Pops

Semiconductor stocks came under pressure Tuesday as a major investor sold its stake in Nvidia, the world's most valuable company. Meanwhile, shares of a media and entertainment giant pushed higher after the company boosted cost-savings targets and discussed heavy investment plans. Major U.S. equities indexes ended the session mixed as investors awaited details on a potential end to the record-setting government shutdown. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, while the Dow jumped 1.2%. Technology was the weakest-performing sector, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.3%. For Investopedia's full daily market summary, click here. Japanese holding company SoftBank (SFTBY) said that it sold its stake in AI chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA). SoftBank stressed that it was not abandoning AI, noting that proceeds from the asset sale would help fund its investments in ChatGPT owner OpenAI. Still, the move weighed on semiconductor stocks: Nvidia sank about 3%, while the PHLX index of chip shares fell 2.5%. The uncertainty surrounding the AI boom extended beyond the semiconductor industry into other areas exposed to the technology. Shares of nuclear-focused energy generator Vistra (VST), which has drawn attention for its opportunity to power AI data centers, dropped 4.8% Tuesday. In its third-quarter earnings report, released last week, Vistra posted lower-than-expected revenue and a year-over-year decline in net income. Viatris (VTRS) presented its strategic growth initiatives at the UBS Global Healthcare Conference Tuesday, and shares of the pharmaceutical company jumped 10%, the most of any S&P 500 stock. The company projected 2% to 3% operational revenue growth excluding issues related to a facility in India. Viatris also said it expects new product launches to generate significant revenue and intends to return more than $1 billion to shareholders. Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares surged 9.8% after the entertainment giant released its first quarterly earnings report since the August completion of the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. The firm outlined major cost-reduction plans, including job cuts tied to asset sales in Argentina and Chile, and lifted its cost-savings target. Paramount Skydance also increased its outlook for merger savings, highlighted ambitious investments in its studio and streaming business, and said it would hike streaming prices. Package delivery giant FedEx (FDX) jumped 5.5% after CFO John Dietrich provided a forecast for fiscal second-quarter earnings per share that exceeded consensus estimates. The upbeat outlook for the critical holiday quarter came as the shipper and its peer United Parcel Service (UPS) navigated challenges related to the grounding of their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo aircraft following a devastating crash last week. UPS rose 2.1% today. AppLovin (APP) shares tumbled 8.7%, posting the steepest daily decline in the benchmark index. Although the mobile advertising technology company topped sales and profit estimates in its latest quarterly report, released Nov. 5, reports of an SEC investigation into AppLovin's data-collection practices b have weighed on the stock. AppLovin stock has gained around 85% year-to-date, boosted by optimism surrounding its AI-powered Axon platform.

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 11, 2025 2:46 PM EST Last month, we shared a story about Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg, who defied the odds as the only voice out of 80 Bloomberg stock watchers who rated Nvidia as a “sell.” While Goldberg makes some very good points — mostly, that AI simply isn’t proficient enough, at least yet, to justify its incredible chokehold on the US economy — the consensus on Wall Street has been firmly against him. Case in point, even after Goldberg made his assessment in the last week of October, investors continued to dump money into Nvidia, which is seen as the “shovel merchant” to the AI goldrush. So much money, in fact, that the company’s market cap briefly shot up above $5 trillion — the first company in history to do so. All that is to say, conventional wisdom is that you’d be nuts to pull an investment in Nvidia right now. Yet that’s exactly what Japanese investment firm SoftBank did on Tuesday, sending numerous tech stocks into a slide. According to Bloomberg, SoftBank disclosed it was pulling its $5.8 billion worth of holdings in Nvidia early Tuesday morning, ending its reign as one of the chip giant’s most prominent backers. The news immediately sent shockwaves throughout the market, dragging Nvidia’s stock down by around 2.6 percent as of Tuesday afternoon. As if to show how codependent the AI industry is, other tech giants were dragged down too, with stock in companies like Tesla falling by 1.8 percent, Meta by 0.95 percent, and Intel around 0.9 percent. Overall, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index was down by 0.2 percent, while the S&P 500 struggled to maintain a flatline. Overall, it would be awful news for the AI industry if it wasn’t for one little wrinkle: SoftBank is planning on using its previous Nvidia holdings to back OpenAI, the private company behind ChatGPT. It’s already given OpenAI $7.5 billion, with plans for another $22.5 billion soon, as Bloomberg reports. In other words, don’t be shocked if the sell-off evens out in the coming days, as Yahoo Finance suggests. That said, there is at least one lesson to take away from the episode. While most other tech stocks tumbled, Apple soared by over 1.5 percent, its share price reaching an all-time high of $273.53. This is despite a disappointing announcement on Monday that the tech giant was delaying the release of the next iPhone Air in 2026. So what gives? When you peel back the “big tech” trappings, Apple stands out as the largest tech corporation to maintain ambivalence about the AI boom. Back in June, Apple’s research lab dropped a bombshell paper calling out companies like OpenAI for selling “the illusion of thinking” in AI chatbots. Apple has increasingly downplayed any efforts at building out a proprietary AI model, after early attempts failed rather spectacularly. All in all, don’t count on Apple to weather the storm completely if the entire AI bubble begins to pop, but when it comes to the touch-and-go volatility of the AI news cycle, the company might just have the last laugh.

Title: Paramount Stock Jumps Over 9% After First Earnings Post-Skydance Deal

Time Published: 2025-11-11T19:40:24Z

Despite the media giant’s “promising start,” analysts warned its turnaround would take a “significant amount of time” Paramount shares jumped more than 9% on Tuesday after the media giant posted its first earnings since the closing of Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition. During the quarter, Paramount swung to a loss of $257 million and revenue growth was flat at $6.7 billion, weighed down by declines in linear advertising and affiliate fees. The results included a $13 million loss and $4.12 billion in revenue under its new owner Skydance and a $244 million loss and $2.58 billion in revenue under the media giant’s previous leadership. But it also saw strong growth in streaming, adding 1.4 million subscribers for a total of 79.1 million globally, and raised its cost savings target to at least $3 billion, up from its previous target of $2 billion. Paramount stock is up 42% in the past year, year to date and the past six months, but is down 2% in the past month. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said that Paramount has the potential to be a “dynamic global media company.” But she warned there are “no easy fixes” and that the company’s turnaround will take “a significant amount of time” and “require substantial investment and investor patience.” “It is clear PSKY has a very strong management team and there will be upward estimate revisions post results,” Ehrlich wrote. “However, there are still many unknowns on the strategic initiatives the company has undertaken and, as evidenced by prior large combinations, restructurings often take years to implement.” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman agreed that Paramount is off to a “promising start,” but acknowledged questions remain about the path ahead, including how Skydance will identify additional cost savings without constraining growth and how much money is needed for its streaming business to “truly compete with the likes of Netflix, Disney and Amazon — all of which hold a considerable lead in global scale, content output and engagement.” “Our broader questions now center on the trajectory required to achieve these longer-term goals — and how they may evolve alongside changes in the company’s spending allocation and potential structural shifts within its portfolio,” Fishman said. “More specifically, we continue to believe that a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery remains a logical next step for the company, one that could meaningfully alter its current trajectory.” Paramount has submitted three separate bids to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, which ranged between $19 and $23.50 per share, and were rejected for being too low. When asked about WBD and its M&A strategy in general, Paramount CEO David Ellison that there are “no must-haves.” “We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” he explained. “We believe we can achieve our goals with our creative content engines, we believe we can achieve our streaming goals and that we can drive enterprise efficiency and create value and long term free cash flow generation all through the building standpoint.” “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long term disciplined owner operators,” Ellison added. “So from that standpoint, we’ll always approach things through the lens of how do we maximize value for shareholders.” In the absence of a combination with WBD, Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris said the company is running a very similar playbook to Warner post-Discovery merger in 2022, where “optimism and increased synergies yield lower financial estimates.” “We believe that Paramount Skydance could be different from prior media industry combinations. But lowering initial profit guidance by 12% due to content acquisitions, despite raising run-rate synergy estimates by $1 billion gives us media merger déjà vu,” Morris said. If the company does not make a transformative acquisition, Morris questioned how content production would increase while reducing headcount driven costs, whether the UFC viewership would be enough to stabilize subscription trends and how it would become the industry’s most technologically capable media company when competing against Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and others. Paramount has said it plans to invest in excess of $1.5 billion in programming in 2026, including streaming investment in the UFC, Paramount+ originals, third-party catalog licensing and ramping up its film slate, with plans to target at least 15 movies per year over the next few years. Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ will also move to a unified backend infrastructure by mid-2026. Looking ahead, Paramount expects $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in revenue, or growth of 1% to 4% year over year, for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in streaming offset by declines in the TV Media and Filmed Entertainment segments. It also expects $500 million to $600 million in adjusted operating income. Additionally, the company anticipates a restructuring charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter related to its “realignment and transformation.” More than $1.4 billion in savings will have been generated between the merger closing in August and the end of 2025, with an additional $1 billion plus in cost savings planned for 2026. It expects to complete those cuts by the end of 2027, generating approximately $800 million in 2026 and between $400 million and $500 million in 2027. In addition to its recent layoffs of roughly 1,000 employees and approximately 600 employees who took voluntary severance in its return to office push, the media giant is also looking at areas such as real estate, procurement and workflow to find efficiencies. As part of a “comprehensive strategic review” of its assets, Paramount recently divested the Argentinian free-to-air network Telefe and is in the process of divesting Chilevisión in Chile, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2026. These divestitures will reduce the company’s workforce by approximately 1,600 additional employees. Paramount+ net adds are expected to come in lower than the third quarter due to the termination of two international hard bundles. On a full year basis, it expects streaming to be profitable in 2025, but with losses in the fourth quarter due to “seasonally-weighted content costs.” The streamer will raise prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. Theatrical revenue is also expected to be down as it reworks its film slate and is impacted by the comparison to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” Starting in the first quarter of 2026, Paramount will change its reporting structure to reflect its reorganization. The move will house all production and IP in one place with Studios, including almost all licensing revenue, while the remaining TV Media segment will be comprised of its broadcasting and cable businesses. For 2026, it is forecasting $30 billion in revenue, a 4% increase from the midpoint of its 2025 forecast, driven by streaming revenue growth due to price increases and the termination of additional international hard bundles, and an adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion, driven by progress in cost-cutting and investments in content and technology. The company expects a “more moderate” decline in linear advertising versus 2025 due to political spending in 2026, new ad agency partnerships, the sale of Telefe and the planned sale of Chilevisión. It also expects to grow streaming profitability in 2026, driven by the UFC, South Park and “several hundred million” dollars of investment in film and series for Paramount+, and return to profitability in its Filmed Entertainment segment on a full-year basis in 2026. Paramount expects to return to investment-grade debt metrics by the end of 2027. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.6 billion in gross debt. It also has $433 million in debt maturing within the next 12 months.

Title: 11 Signs That The U.S. Economy Is In the Worst Shape That It Has Been Since The Great Recession

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Do you remember how bad things were in 2008 and 2009? It was an economic nightmare that shook the entire world, and now it appears that the sequel is upon us. As you will see below, many economic numbers are either as bad as they have been since the Great Recession or they are even worse than they were during the Great Recession. Despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the truth is that the cold, hard facts prove that the U.S. economy has been rapidly heading in the wrong direction for years. Now we have reached a major tipping point, and it won’t take much to push us over the edge. If you doubt what I am saying, just keep reading. The following are 11 signs that the U.S. economy is in the worst shape that it has been since the Great Recession… #1 U.S. consumer sentiment just continues to move in the wrong direction. In fact, U.S. consumer sentiment just fell to the second lowest reading ever… Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university’s monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October’s 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November’s reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. #2 For years, U.S. consumers have been foolishly piling up enormous mountains of debt. Now the average U.S. credit score is falling at the fastest pace that we have seen since the Great Recession… In another indication of a puttering economy, the average credit score in the U.S. has fallen by two points since this time last year. The credit scoring firm FICO said Tuesday that the average credit score for all U.S. consumers is now 715, down from 717 logged in October 2024. According to separately released FICO data, the decline marks the first time since 2009 during the Great Recession that the average FICO score has fallen by two points within one year. #3 The employment market has really tightened up all over the nation. If you are looking for a temporary job this holiday season, it is being projected that holiday hiring with be at the lowest level that we have seen since the Great Recession… Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday. NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group’s conference call on that those hiring expectations “reflect the softening and slowing labor market.” It’s a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said. #4 As hiring has gotten tighter, layoffs are way up. In fact, we just witnessed the most layoffs in a single month during the fourth quarter since 2008… The report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, showed 153,074 job cuts announced in October, an increase of 183% from cuts announced in September and up 175% from the same month in 2024. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Challenger said in a release. That year was a pivotal moment in the Great Recession, in which thousands of jobs were lost around the world and the global economy faced a period of contraction. #5 The American people are not stupid. They can see what is going on, and they are now the most pessimistic about finding a job that they have been “since at least 2013”… Americans now have the least confidence in finding a new job since at least 2013, a period also known as the depths of the “jobless recovery” following the Great Recession. According to the latest August 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Federal Reserve, the perceived probability of securing a new job in case of job loss has dropped to 44.9%. That’s the lowest reading since the start of the series in June 2013. The decline was broad-based across age, education, and income groups, the New York Fed reported, “but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.” #6 Total household debt just hit another brand new record high. Not even during the Great Recession were we facing a crisis of this magnitude… Total household debt climbed to a record $18.6 trillion last quarter, and while most borrowers remain on track with payments, young Americans are feeling the pressure. #7 I have been warning that Americans have been getting behind on their debts. Now the percentage of outstanding balances that are seriously delinquent has risen to the highest level in more than a decade… During the third quarter, 3 percent of outstanding balances became seriously delinquent — 90 days or more past due — the largest quarterly increase since 2014, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among those ages 18 to 29, the rate was about 5 percent — more than double a year earlier and the highest of any age group. #8 The cost of living crisis never seems to end. Aluminum prices are now increasing at an exponential rate, and that isn’t going to help matters at all… Aluminum prices in the U.S. climbed to new record highs on Monday as domestic inventories tightened sharply, driven by the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum tariffs designed to bolster and revitalize America’s industrial base. According to Bloomberg, the all-in U.S. aluminum price, combining the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark and the U.S. Midwest delivery premium, hit a record high of $4,816 per ton, nearly double the level from the December 2023 lows. #9 Have you noticed that restaurant chains are closing vast numbers of locations all over the nation? Wendy’s is the latest major chain to announce mass closures… Fast food chain Wendy’s is planning to close hundreds more stores just a year after shuttering 140 locations. Interim CEO Ken Cook told investors in a Friday, Nov. 7, quarterly earnings call that the company would be closing a “mid single-digit percentage” of locations. With around 6,000 locations still operating nationwide, this would amount to roughly 240 to 360 stores. One investor estimated the number at about 300 locations during the call. “When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective,” said Cook. “The goal is to address and fix those restaurants.” #10 Manufacturing numbers often tell us where the economy is heading next. So the fact that U.S. manufacturing has fallen for eight months in a row is certainly not a good sign… US manufacturing turned down in October on the PMI index, dropping from 49.1 in September to 48.7 in October, marking the eighth consecutive month of contraction. Price pressure may have eased (58 from 61.9), but production (48.2 from 51), inventory (45.8 from 47.7), and deliveries (54.2 from 52.6) have all declined. Employment in the sector continued to decline (46 from 45.3), and 67% of panelist noted that companies are working on managing their current workforce rather than hiring. #11 The tech industry has been one of the very few bright spots for the U.S. economy in 2025. But even our largest tech companies have been conducting absolutely brutal layoffs… The scale of layoffs is unprecedented: by October, over 112,000 tech employees had been let go across 218 companies. Amazon alone confirmed 14,000 job cuts, citing the need to “reduce bureaucracy” and reallocate resources. The trend is driven by rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence, which are fundamentally changing the nature of tech work. “It feels like companies are prioritizing efficiency over human capital,” said a recently laid-off engineer, echoing the concerns of many affected workers. The ripple effects extend beyond individual careers, impacting families and communities as local economies absorb the shock of sudden unemployment. We were warned that economic conditions would deteriorate, and that is precisely what has happened. But what we have been through so far is not even worth comparing to what is eventually coming. It was a nice ride while it lasted. In 2009, the federal government was 10 trillion dollars in debt, and now it is 38 trillion dollars in debt. Meanwhile, state and local government debt, corporate debt and consumer debt have all soared into uncharted territory. We have been on the greatest debt binge in human history, but what did we get for it? We could have made much different choices, but instead we chose to literally destroy our future. Now a time of reckoning is upon us, and it isn’t going to be fun.

Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

Investing Caterpillar (CAT) shares are up over 56% year to date. The company set a sales growth target of around 6% for the next four years. Caterpillar trades at more than 23 times forward P/E after its recent rally. Goldman Sachs (GS) is up over 36% year to date and more than 142% in the last two years. Goldman Sachs trades below 15 times forward P/E with a 2.0% dividend yield. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Scott Olson / Getty Images The Dow Jones Industrial Average offers too small a sample size for many to be an effective gauge of how well the stock market is doing on any given day. But, of course, we have the S&P 500 for that, which is more widely followed and invested in by investors. Still, having only 30 stocks in a basket does make the Dow an interesting and reasonably well-diversified portfolio that might act as a model for new investors looking to get started in the stock-picking game. Of course, the Dow Jones basket can be fun to keep tabs on as a beginner. And, of course, the index has a very rich history on Wall Street alongside a price that’s continued to swell, serving as an example of the wonders of compounding over extremely long periods of time. In any case, if you’re a fan of blue chips and are interested in when the legendary index adds a new holding or gives one the boot, you might be compelled to see what’s winning or losing in any given year. Though the year isn’t over yet, this piece will explore a few Dow stocks that have had their way with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NYSEARCA:VTI), which are both up close to 15%, so far this year. But does their recent hot streak warrant chasing them into the new year? Let’s find out. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a heavy-duty construction machinery company that I found to be one of the most surprising market beaters for 2025. Shares of Caterpillar are up over 56% year to date, and despite recent turbulence, the rally off Liberation Day lows still seems intact. Wall Street analysts have high hopes for the $263 billion industrial blue chip going into 2026, especially after the firm revealed some pretty upbeat targets during its latest Investor Day meeting. Could Caterpillar really be in for a renaissance of growth over the next four years? Perhaps. A sales growth rate of around 6% seems easily doable, especially as buyers better appreciate its digital technologies. That said, the business of construction, mining, and all the sort can be quite cyclical. And with that, investors had better have a tolerance for pain should the environment shift drastically. If a recession is encountered at some point down the road, the rosy sales guidance may be too high a bar that’s been set. Either way, I’m cautiously optimistic about the name while it’s trading for more than 23 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). I could be wrong, but I think much of the optimism and strength might already be priced in here. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is up over 36% year to date, but more impressively, it’s up more than 142% in the last two years. The iconic investment bank really is firing on all cylinders, thanks to tons of dealmaking momentum, which is expected to carry into the new year, as well as continued resilience in the economy. If M&A looks to kick things up a few notches, the good days for Goldman Sachs might be about to get even better. In any case, the stock looks way too cheap at less than 15 times forward P/E, with a nice and growing 2.0%-yielding dividend. While I’m no fan of chasing rallies, it’s hard to make a case against Goldman Sachs when it’s going for so cheap, with such macro tailwinds at its back. In the new year, I would not be surprised if shares top the S&P 500 once again. It’s a winner that has all the tools to continue winning big.

SoftBank is out of Nvidia stock—but not the AI trade. The Japanese company in a Tuesday statement said it sold 32.1 million shares of chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), a "complete sale," in October, raising $5.83 billion. That comes to an average price of just under $182, below Monday's $199.05 per share close. (It also reported $9.17 billion in proceeds on sales of T-Mobile (TMUS) between June and September.) Nvidia's shares hit their latest record high of $212 in late October, but investors more recently have shown signs of wariness about valuations and the health of the AI trade. That's shown up in today's action, too; Nvidia's stock was down more than 3% in midday trading, more than broader markets. But SoftBank isn't pulling back from AI investments. It put billions of dollars into OpenAI earlier this year, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most-valuable startup, and that appears to be behind some of the company's latest investment moves; The company last month committed more than $22 billion in additional funding to OpenAI. Traders trying to time an AI bubble don't have it easy, and today's Nvidia news illustrates why. It might be tempting to read SoftBank's sale of Nvidia shares as a bearish signal—but the move is meant to raise money to fund investments in OpenAI. “We are making large investments in OpenAI,” The Wall Street Journal quoted SoftBank CFO Yoshimitsu Goto as saying today. “To do that, we have to use some of our existing assets to raise funds.” Investors trying to connect the dots these days don't have an easy job. Concerns about AI-stock valuations have weighed on shares lately, with some analysts suggesting shorting the hyperscalers whose spending has driven business and share prices this year. The word "bubble" has been in pretty heavy use in recent weeks. But elsewhere in the trade, investors continue to look for opportunities to push some shares in the food chain higher. Yesterday, for example, it was memory and data-storage stocks. And interest in the big names has hardly dried up; Nvidia, for example, was held by more than three-quarters of active fund managers in October, according to a Bank of America analysis.

Monday's rebound in crypto markets quickly unwound on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$95,232.79 slipping back to $103,000. After briefly topping $107,000 overnight, the largest cryptocurrency fell to $102,900 during U.S. hours, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours. The drop erased the gains fueled by President Donald Trump's "tariff dividend" plan and rising optimism the U.S. government shutdown is about to end. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,168.38 fell 2.3% to below $3,500 and large-cap altcoins such as Solana's SOL SOL$141.23, XRP$2.2992 and SUI$1.7823 dropped 4%-5%, marking a broad retreat across digital assets. The selling extended into crypto-related equities, especially among bitcoin miners positioned as infrastructure plays in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. CleanSpark (CLSK) dropped 8%, Hut 8 (HUT) fell nearly 9% and Core Scientific (CORZ) tumbled 11.5% in the early session. TeraWulf (WULF) and Bitdeer (BTDR) also booked double-digit declines. The sector-wide weakness stemmed from a roster of firms reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and growth outlook in a sign that the red-hot AI infrastructure trade, driven by lofty expectations of demand for increased computing capacity, is due for a correction. Cloud computing provider CoreWeave lowered its next quarter outlook, citing delays in data center development, sending its stock 15% lower to the weakest level since early September. TeraWulf reported weak earnings and BitDeer posted deeper-than-expected losses and delay in its next-generation ASIC chips. Rounding up the negative headlines was Japanese investment bank SoftBank selling its entire stake, worth $5.8 billion, in chipmaking giant and AI bellwether Nvidia (NVDA), driving the world's most valuable company's stock 3.5% lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. Also this morning the ADP reported that U.S. private employers cut an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Oct. 25, signaling a deteriorating labor market. The CME FedWatch tool now prices a roughly 67% chance of an interest-rate cut at the Federal Reserve's December meeting, while Polymarket sees it slightly higher at 72%. With Tuesday's tumble, BTC has now filled the so-called CME gap formed over the weekend. The gap occurs when bitcoin futures traded on the CME, the preferred marketplace among U.S. institutions, opens higher or lower than where it closed the previous session. BTC revisiting these gaps in price is often seen in market behavior, though not all gaps are necessarily filled, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted. While the overall sentiment on crypto markets has improved the past few days as BTC and ETH bounced from the lows, traders are using the rebound as an opportunity to take profits across the board, Jasper De Maere, an OTC desk strategist at trading firm Wintermute, wrote in a Tuesday note. "When it comes to alts, the theme is still profit taking into strength, leading to short lived outperformance," he said. "Consensus is building that majors need to move higher first." Bitcoin is still holding it's trading range between $100,000 and $110,000, still consolidating, Paul Howard, senior director at trading firm Wincent, told CoinDesk.

Title: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Investor angst over Big Tech’s AI spending spills into bond market
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/11/11/investor-angst-over-big-techs-ai-spending-spills-into-bond-market/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T16:17:12Z
Full Content:
Investors have been selling off the debt of US tech heavyweights, showing how jitters over Silicon Valley’s boom in spending on artificial intelligence have spilled into the bond market. A basket of bonds issued by so-called hyperscalers – companies that are building vast data centres, including Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle – has sustained a hit in recent weeks. The spread, or premium in yield that investors demand to buy the debt over Treasuries, has climbed to 0.78 percentage points, the highest level since US president Donald Trump sent markets reeling in April with his tariff plans, and up from 0.5 points in September, according to Bank of America data. The widening spread highlights how investors are increasingly concerned with the way tech groups are turning to debt markets to finance their investments in AI infrastructure. “The important thing the market woke up to in the past two weeks is that it’s the public markets that are going to need to finance this AI boom,” said Brij Khurana, a fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management. JPMorgan on Monday said building AI infrastructure would cost more than $5 trillion (€4.3 trillion) and “will likely require participation from every public capital market as well as private credit, alternative capital providers and even government involvement”. The mammoth scale of investment in AI infrastructure has raised concerns about overcapacity, long-term profitability and energy demands. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will spend more than $400 billion on data centres in 2026, on top of more than $350 billion this year. Tech groups are issuing debt at a quick rate to fund their AI expansion efforts despite having large cash hoards, which is something some investors worry could signal a shift to higher levels of leverage. “The hyperscalers collectively hold [about] $350 billion in liquid cash and investments and are expected to generate [roughly] $725 billion of operating cash flow in 2026,” JPMorgan said. “Even so, substantial new debt supply is coming to the credit markets from these high-quality issuers.” In recent weeks, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle have hit markets with blockbuster debt packages, some with maturities as long as 40 years. Meta last month forged a $27 billion private debt deal with investors, including Pimco and Blue Owl Capital, to fund development of its “Hyperion” data centre in Louisiana. It raised an additional $30 billion in bonds at the end of October, the biggest corporate bond deal since 2023. Meanwhile, Alphabet sold $25 billion of bonds in early November, $17.5 billion of which were raised in the US and $7.5 billion in Europe. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to fund infrastructure leases such as OpenAI’s “Stargate” data centre in Abilene, Texas. Analysts noted Oracle’s debt has been hit particularly hard in recent months. An index compiled by the Financial Times tracking its debt that has been trading since before the latest bond sale has fallen almost 5 per cent since mid-September, compared with a price fall of about 1 per cent for a broad Ice Data Services basket tracking US high-grade tech debt. Oracle has about $96 billion of long-term debt, according to Bloomberg data. It has rapidly grown its debt balances as part of a series of deals to lease computing power to ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the US software group said would generate $300 billion in revenue over the next five years. But credit rating agency Moody’s has flagged significant risks from Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its growth. Smaller companies at the heart of the AI boom have also been hit. Data centre operator CoreWeave’s stock has fallen more than 20 per cent over the past two weeks, alongside the drop in bigger names. On Tuesday, the company’s shares were down a further 14 per cent after it lowered its forecast for annual revenue as a result of expected data centre delays. The cost to protect against a default on CoreWeave’s debt has jumped as the equity price has fallen, with the group’s five-year credit default swaps trading at 505 basis points, from below 350bp at the start of October, according to LSEG data. Some analysts argue that the decline in hyperscalers’ bonds in the wake of such large issuance is healthy. “As long as we are still pricing incremental risk, it’s a good sign. The thing I worry about is a rally on more supply rather than a sell-off,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “We’re still in early innings in this debt cycle for AI,” he said.

The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million active monthly ad-supported viewers. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Prime Video now reaches an average of more than 315 million ad-supported viewers each month globally, according to figures released by Amazon. The streaming giant introduced advertising in the UK in February 2024 and first reported audience data in April of that year, when its monthly ad-supported reach stood at 200 million. Amazon says the 315 million figure represents an unduplicated average monthly active ad-supported audience across Originals, licensed series and films, live sports, events and free ad-supported live channels on Prime Video. The estimate is based on internal data collected over 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025, with some variations depending on launch dates. Over the past 18 months, Prime Video has rolled out advertising in 16 markets, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the US.What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing Prime Video Advertising’s vice president Jeremy Helfand describes this number as a “transformative milestone” for the streamer. “This expanded audience across 16 countries demonstrates our customer-obsessed approach to enhancing the viewing experience while delivering powerful opportunities for brands,” he says. The announcement follows Netflix’s introduction of a new audience metric last week, reporting more than 190 million monthly active viewers (MAV) globally for its ad tier. Netflix defines MAV as members who have watched at least one minute of ads in a month, multiplied by the estimated average number of people per household. Netflix said it hopes the MAV metric will become an industry-wide standard, noting that streaming platforms currently lack a universal measure for ad reach.Netflix hits 190 million monthly ad viewers according to new metric Separately, Amazon today (11 November) announced the international expansion of its AI-powered video generator tool to advertisers in the UK. The tool lets advertisers create “high-motion” videos from product images, existing videos or Amazon product detail pages. For example, a brand could create a video of a watch on someone’s wrist or a toy being actively played with by uploading an image of the product. In the US, where the feature launched in June, Amazon says more than 60% of products promoted with the video generator had never been advertised on the sponsored video page before. In the third quarter, total ad revenue across all of Amazon jumped 24% year-on-year, reaching $17.7bn, outpacing other tech giants, including Meta, Google and YouTube. AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Marketing Week’s weekly round-up of the technology stories that impact the marketing sector: from AI to martech, regulation to public perceptions. Amazon’s ad ranks in the top 7% of all ads this month, according to the latest The Works study. Cheez-It became the biggest launch in its category in four years, when it launched last year. Owner Kellanova has ambitions in the long-term to create an “iconic” brand in the UK. UK marketers are more likely to be “fully confident” in their abilities with AI, but there remains a gap between application and training. New research from LinkedIn’s B2B Institute and Ehrenberg-Bass urges B2B marketers to focus on being findable as much as being memorable.

Title: 3 Buy-And-Forget Dividend Stocks With Snowballing Payouts

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/2466866647" target="_blank" style="font-size: 100%">Investment and saving money concept. A man placing coins with growing tree with white up arrow of financial developments and business growth</a> (<a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/license" target="_blank" style="100%">Shutterstock.com</a>) by <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Sichon" target="_blank" style="100%">Sichon</a> If the headline yield today is not something you’re concerned with, and you pay more attention to how fast a yield can grow, then it’s worth buying dividend stocks you can forget about for decades. By the time you cash out, stocks like TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) may snowball fast enough to beat the broader market significantly. As with any strategy, there are pros and cons to keep in mind. The most significant disadvantage is that things become highly unpredictable when you stretch out your time horizon decades into the future. To account for this disadvantage, you should only put your money into blue-chip dividend growth stocks. The advantage of investing in dividend stocks with snowballing payouts is that it can keep you ahead of the broader market over the long term. For example, a stock that yields 2% and grows its dividends by 10% annually could compound to a 35% yield on cost at year 30. The following three dividend growth stocks can make that happen. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, has been a major beneficiary of the semiconductor boom. Most semiconductor companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are actually fabless companies, meaning the manufacturing is done by TSMC. Many investors overlook just how much pricing power and importance this one company holds over the entire tech industry today. This is why TSM stock is perhaps the best way to play the AI game long-term. It doesn’t matter if Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), or some other company dominates the future AI chip industry. Rest assured, TSMC is likely to be the one manufacturing these chips. The company is in the process of building plants in Arizona to ensure that it can survive any Taiwan-specific shocks while lessening any future tariff impacts. TSM is already exempt from paying chip tariffs. Hence, I see it as a safe long-term stock to hold if you want snowballing dividends. TSM comes with a trailing dividend yield of 1.09%, but the five-year dividend growth rate is at 11.28% annually. The payout ratio is also very low at 4.88%. If TSM were to distribute 20% of its earnings as dividends, the dividend yield would approach 4.5%. EPS is expected to grow from $10.35 in 2025 to $15.6 in 2027. So, even a constant payout ratio of 5% can lead to solid dividend growth here. Fastenal is an industrial supply company that specializes in fasteners, tools, and related products. FAST stock has been one of the most reliable and dependable long-term names, and the growth trajectory has been highly predictable. That said, it is currently undergoing a cooldown, as the stock has retreated by 19% from its peak of $50. It is still up 15% year-to-date, and it remains in a strong long-term uptrend. Thus, I see no reason to be bearish here. In fact, the discount gives you a great entry point. You get a 2.15% yield with a five-year dividend growth rate of 11.84% annually. EPS is expected to grow at ~10% annually for the foreseeable future, and the ongoing push to onshore and reindustrialize America could lead to more positive surprises down the line. Novo Nordisk is in the toughest spot compared to the two other stocks in this list, but it also gives you the most opportunity. The weight loss market is huge, and the rising tide is likely to lift all boats in the long term, including Novo Nordisk. NVO stock is down nearly 58% over the past year due to slowing demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Novo Nordisk also cut its full-year 2025 growth guidance four times. It now expects sales growth of 8% to 11%. The company also abandoned its $10 billion bid for Metsera. On the flip side, the stock looks very cheap at these levels. You’re paying less than 13x forward earnings now for a company with significant long-term potential. The market for weight-loss drugs remains huge, and it retains a larger market share in Europe, where it is based. This is a good buy-the-dip opportunity if you want to buy and hold for decades. You get a juicy 3.78% dividend yield to sweeten the deal. The five-year dividend growth rate is 21.57% annually, and the payout ratio is at 52.39%.

Business The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato SoftBank Group's $5.8 billion sale of its Nvidia stake jolted stock markets on Tuesday, stoking fears that the frenzy around artificial intelligence may have peaked, especially after recent warnings from Wall Street bank chiefs and a famed short seller. In its quarterly results, the Japanese tech investor said it had sold all the 32.1 million Nvidia shares it held in October to bankroll CEO Masayoshi Son's sweeping AI push, built around his "all in" bet on ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. SoftBank needs the proceeds for initiatives including the $500 billion Stargate project to expand U.S. data-center capacity and as much as $40 billion funding pledged to OpenAI, whose financing details were not given with the announcements. But the timing of its sale deepened some investor doubts that valuations in the AI industry might have gotten ahead of fundamentals.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading Nvidia shares were down more than 2 per cent in early trading, weighing on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Adding to the jitters was a revenue forecast cut from AI cloud provider CoreWeave over a contract delay that sent its stock down 9 per cent.Drumbeats of an AI bubble grew louder in recent weeks after Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs CEOs warned equities could be heading to a drawdown, while hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for shorts on the U.S. housing market ahead of the 2008 crash, bet against Nvidia and Palantir.Several analysts said the sale suggested Son - one of tech's most audacious investors - sees the blistering rally that turned Nvidia into the first $5 trillion company last month cooling after a more than 1,200 per cent surge in the past three years.But a few of them pointed to SoftBank's patchy record managing its Nvidia holdings. The company, by some estimates, missed out on a more than $100 billion rally in Nvidia shares by selling it off in 2019 before the AI boom took off, only to later buy the chipmaker's shares again. "As for timing, cannot say Masayoshi Son has been great with his trading of Nvidia shares," said C J Muse, senior managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. "It appears simply resource allocation – finding funds to make bets elsewhere."OPENAI FOCUS, SON'S GROWING WARCHESTAlong with the Nvidia share sale, SoftBank sold around $9.2 billion worth of shares in T-Mobile, providing Son with a larger money chest to stamp his influence on an industry hungry for the capital and chips needed to fund the pursuit of AI technology that can match or surpass human intelligence. "By cashing in now, he's securing the capital needed to double down on his conviction in AI applications and the super-scaled infrastructure behind them, OpenAI, Oracle and the Stargate project," said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors. But the rising bet on OpenAI also ties SoftBank, which has taken massive losses on its Vision Fund investments, closer to the startup at the center of a series of circular deals that have fueled worries about the bubble. The Japanese company's stock, which has surged more than twofold this year, is getting priced more and more based on its exposure to OpenAI.The stock jumped last month on news of a sweeping OpenAI restructuring that frees the startup from its non-profit roots. The startup is considering a $1 trillion public listing as soon as next year, which could be a big windfall for investors such as Microsoft and SoftBank, Reuters has reported.The rising valuation of OpenAI also boosted SoftBank's second-quarter net profit, which more than doubled. But OpenAI has not given any clear details on how it plans to fund its AI infrastructure deals that total around $1.4 trillion. It expects to finish the year with $20 billion in annual recurring revenue and recently walked back comments on need for government-backed loans."The Vision Fund's checkered past certainly lends an air of high-stakes poker to this divestment," Schulman said.

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as the AI trade takes another wild turn. Nvidia’s $500 billion rebound has the market buzzing again, but behind the headlines, old believers are cashing out and skeptics are circling. Euphoria is back, but so are the warning signs. Nvidia’s record-breaking rebound has reignited the AI trade, adding half a trillion dollars in market value within just two trading days. Yet beneath the euphoria, major investors are pulling back, and the warnings are getting louder. On Monday, Nvidia shares surged 5.8%, marking their largest daily gain since April. Between midday Friday and Monday’s close, the chipmaker added roughly $500 billion in market capitalization, equivalent to $43 billion per trading hour. 💥BREAKING:NVIDIA SURGES BY 5.8% IN TODAY'S TRADING, ITS BIGGEST DAILY GAIN SINCE APRIL. pic.twitter.com/LFzsEOxUNI The rally came after a bruising week in which Nvidia had lost nearly $800 billion in value, highlighting how swiftly capital is rotating in and out of the AI trade. “Nvidia added $500 billion in market cap in just 48 hours — entries into this historic run are scarce,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote. “Dip buyers are still out in full force.” At a $5.1 trillion valuation, Nvidia now represents 8.5% of the S&P 500. This is larger than the sum of six of the index’s 11 sectors, including Materials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Its market cap also exceeds the combined value of the entire stock markets of Italy, Spain, the UAE, and the Netherlands. While retail investors continue to chase Nvidia’s ascent, SoftBank has quietly exited. The Japanese conglomerate sold its entire $5.83 billion Nvidia stake in October, alongside part of its $9.17 billion T-Mobile holding, as part of a strategy it called “asset monetization.” JUST IN: SoftBank announces it has sold its entire stake in $NVDA for $5.8 billion. pic.twitter.com/9qSOxkZXjd The sales helped SoftBank report a ¥2.92 trillion ($19.1 billion) second-quarter profit, more than double last year’s, powered by $19 billion in Vision Fund gains largely tied to its OpenAI holdings. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split and raised its interim dividend as CEO Masayoshi Son reaffirmed SoftBank’s “all-in” commitment to artificial intelligence, robotics, and data infrastructure. SoftBank’s Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said the sales were meant to ensure “safe funding” as the firm prepares to deploy more than $30 billion in fresh investments this quarter. “We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities while maintaining financial strength,” TradFi media reported, citing Goto. However, not everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Michael Burry, famed for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, warned that hyperscalers and cloud giants may be artificially inflating earnings by extending the “useful life” of compute equipment. In doing so, they allegedly reduce reported depreciation on AI infrastructure purchased from Nvidia and other suppliers. Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings -one of the more common frauds of the modern era.Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful… pic.twitter.com/h0QkktMeUB Burry estimated $176 billion in understated depreciation between 2026 and 2028, which he claims could overstate profits at companies like Oracle and Meta by 27% and 21%, respectively. Against these backdrops,some analysts warn that the math behind the AI boom does not add up. Ross Hendricks noted that to justify current AI valuations, global revenues would need to rise 20x in five years, or else capital expenditure would need to “collapse,” triggering a broad market correction. The AI math ain’t mathin Two ways to fix it: 20x revenue in the next five years, or slash data center capexI’ll take the latter on 100 to 1 oddsSo what does a capex pullback look like? It means hyperscaler cloud computing earnings and NVDA chip sales evaporate.. and with… https://t.co/eI4HIIczTZ Even so, momentum remains unstoppable, for now. Nvidia has become the defining stock of the AI era, its chips powering everything from data centers to large language models like OpenAI’s GPT series. Yet the contrasting moves by SoftBank and warnings from Burry suggest the market’s biggest winner could soon face its toughest test.

Title: Warren Buffett’s last shareholder letter offers 5 lessons for CEOs and warns that ‘envy and greed walk hand in hand’

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. The U.S. celebrates Veteran’s Day today, and we are sending a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has served. Speaking of gratitude, Warren Buffett dropped his ‘farewell’ letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday and offered a master class in introspection, recognizing his own good luck, and passing on sage advice. I’d highly recommend reading the letter in its entirety, but here are a few lessons for leaders I think are worth underscoring: Curb Your Envy: “What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?” Learn From Failure: “Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes—learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” Measure Success Through Impact: “Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.” Ponder Your Legacy: Buffett talks about how FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, once revered by Americans in the 1930s, “became disgraced for misusing his post.” His advice: “Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it … You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.” Bet on America: “Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Softbank offloads Nvidia Softbank on Tuesday sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia, pocketing $5.8 billion in a surprise move. Masayoshi Son’s company more than doubled its quarterly net profit thanks in large part to its bet on OpenAI. Shutdown may ease A splinter group of Democrats joined Senate Republicans in passing a measure to reopen the government on Monday night. The legislation now goes to the House, which is expected to take it up no later than Wednesday. Meanwhile, flight cancellations and delays spread amid a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay. President Trump on Monday threatened to “dock” the pay of any controllers who take time off. CoreWeave results AI data-center and infrastructure operator CoreWeave nearly doubled its revenue backlog to $55.6 billion, surpassing a critical Wall Street benchmark, though its debt increased and it revised down its full-year revenue guidance. Investors are following CoreWeave closely since it could be “a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up,” Fortune’s Amanda Gerut reports. Turmoil at the BBC The crisis at the BBC deepened on Monday after President Trump threatened to sue the broadcaster for $1 billion over the erroneous editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. Two BBC executives have already resigned over the matter; the president has demanded an apology and compensation for “harm caused.” The real cost of Trump’s tariff dividend President Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff dividend for all Americans (excluding “high income people”) will cost more than twice the revenue generated by tariffs, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The extra cost would have to be added to the already ballooning federal deficit. UBS economists’ labor market concerns UBS economists in their latest “US Economics Weekly” note compared the national labor market to a bathtub that is losing water (total jobs) as layoffs persist and the flow of jobs slows. “That is a material risk to the outlook,” the investment bank wrote.

Title: What Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs reveal about AI’s grip on marketing
URL: https://www.marketingweek.com/amazon-layoffs-ai/
Time Published: 2025-11-11T06:42:31Z
Full Content:
AI is taking jobs from marketers in areas such as SEO and ad production, but the challenge remains the same: make yourself irreplaceable by creating value. Amazon’s decision to cut 14,000 jobs this quarter – roughly half the number initially feared – confirms what most boardrooms already know: artificial intelligence isn’t just a productivity tool, it’s a restructuring driver. Forget the polite language about “culture” from CEO Andy Jassy or “people and customers” from HR chief Beth Galetti. The driver is efficiency. Investors want AI-level margins, not human-level headcount. And Amazon isn’t the outlier. Nestlé plans to remove 12,000 white-collar roles over the next two years. Salesforce has already replaced 4,000 customer people with the rise of AI agents. UPS has shed nearly 50,000 jobs since 2024, citing machine learning. Agency Dentsu has trimmed 3,400 worldwide. Not all job losses are liked to AI or marketing – but many are. Check your LinkedIn feed and you’ll see the fallout: marketers, analysts, planners – ‘open to work’. Marketing Week’s 2025 Career & Salary Survey captured that unease across the industry. (If you haven’t already, do your profession a favour and take part in the latest survey before 21 November.) The pattern is clear. AI is collapsing the space between strategy and execution – the white-collar layer where much of marketing, operations and customer service used to live. The search-optimisation industry – worth billions globally – exists largely to please algorithms, not customers. As users move from classic search to AI search with Perplexity, ChatGPT and Claude, traditional SEO will fade. It’ll be replaced by a new layer of ‘generative engine optimisation’ (GEO) equally detached from customer value, perhaps just more automated. Posting, scheduling and A/B testing across Meta and TikTok are already automatable. The ‘digital native’ roles created in the 2010s – once seen as the new frontier – are now the first to go. The irony: the generation that disrupted traditional marketing is now being disrupted by its own tools. Routine copywriting and influencer work are being commoditised fast. Virtual influencers have already fronted campaigns for beauty brands like L’Oréal offering perpetual, low-cost exposure – without mood swings, agents or scheduling conflicts. The majority of consumers cannot tell – or do not care – that the presenter isn’t human. Coca-Cola’s first AI-generated classic Coke caravan holiday commercial marked a turning point. Writing on X, Gravity Falls creator Alex Hirsch captured the industry’s unease: “FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” The Verge, meanwhile, described Coke’s latest 2025 AI Christmas ads as “a sloppy eyesore”. But it’s early days and the shift is inevitable. I once flew 30 people to South Africa for 30 seconds of beach footage. If AI can render 50 versions of the same ad overnight, be my guest. Mondelez just spent $40m on generative video platforms promising to halve production costs. In that kind of math, efficiency always wins the budget battle. Good news. AI may bring rigour to an area marketers have long avoided: measurement. The excuse that “it’s too complex to track” is eroding. AI-driven attribution and modelling could finally give the industry what it has lacked for decades – a standardised way to diagnose growth and prove ROI. For a discipline often allergic to evidence, there’s a cultural reset coming. I’ve read 20 corporate layoff memos this quarter. Beyond AI, they all mention “less critical roles” and “unnecessary layers”. Context matters. European GDP (the UK included) will grow just over 1% this year; the US a tad more. Across most markets, budgets are tightening. In that climate, CEOs are asking one question with increasing regularity: does this role contribute to growth? If the answer is unclear, the role is at risk. I’ve said it for years – if marketers don’t stand for growth, they stand for nothing. Growth is the reason marketing exists. Yet large parts of the discipline still retreat into comfortable abstractions of ‘brand love’ and ‘storytelling’. In a world where CEOs get more serious about growth, those arguments won’t survive the meeting. Ask: what are my company’s top three priorities? What are my customers’ top three priorities? The overlap is where growth happens. That’s the value creation zone. Maybe a competitor has a better product. Maybe your pricing’s off. Maybe your media strategy is underpowered. Whatever your job description says, if you operate inside the value creation zone – and make that visible – your role will be relevant. Which parts of your job could AI do better or cheaper? If large chunks can be automated, they will be. You can’t out-AI AI. Replace yourself before someone else does. Let machines handle the routine while you trade up to what they still can’t do well: judgment, creativity and the courage to ask questions no dataset can answer. AI will add mediocrity – at scale. Boston Consulting Group ran a revealing experiment: two groups solved the same marketing problems; one using AI, one without. AI helped the group perform 40% better in a product innovation task but resulted in 41% less diversity of ideas. Machines replicate knowledge; they can’t generate intuition. AI makes average things for average people (hello, Mico). Great marketers work on the edges – where ideas still feel slightly dangerous. Very soon, every marketer will face their own ‘Matrix moment’ – accept automation’s illusion of control, or take back the job of creating growth. Here’s the choice: Take the blue pill, and hand over your marketing to the machines (Meta and co are building that version of the future). Take the red pill, and step up as a growth leader who uses AI as leverage. The choice is existential. In the AI economy, marketing rainmakers stay. Everyone else may become optional. Amid wider strategic shifts, some B2B firms are experimenting with new senior roles in an effort to “redefine” marketing. Emotion and vulnerability are celebrated in advertising, but often lacking in leadership. It’s a double standard marketers must stop ignoring. Marketers who see brand building as an end in itself are mistaking the work they do for the results it delivers. New research from LinkedIn’s B2B Institute and Ehrenberg-Bass urges B2B marketers to focus on being findable as much as being memorable.

Title: Job cuts hit 22-year October high as retail layoffs from Amazon to Target mount ahead of holidays

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail. U.S. firms announced the most job cuts for any October in more than 20 years, fueled in part by mass layoffs at major retail companies. Employers slashed 153,074 jobs last month, up 175% from a year earlier, according to a Thursday report from global outplacement and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. October’s total marked the highest for the month since 2003, driven largely by cost-cutting, though artificial intelligence ranked as the second-most cited factor. Year-to-date layoffs were already at their highest level since 2020 before the heavy downsizing that occurred last month. Retail has been one of the hardest hit industries this year, behind only warehousing and non-profits. So far in 2025, the sector has announced 88,664 job cuts, a 145% increase from the 36,136 recorded through October last year. The cuts come after a series of large-scale reductions across the retail industry. Amazon announced plans last week to eliminate 14,000 corporate roles as part of CEO Andy Jassy’s effort to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Target, meanwhile, shed 1,800 white-collar positions amid slowing sales. Other consumer-facing companies such as Starbucks and UPS have pared back staff in recent months. “There was an enormous amount of hiring that happened in that post-Covid period in retail, and retail is facing some other specific issues,” Andrew Challenger, workplace and labor expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Modern Retail in an interview. “Tariffs, immigration and persistent inflation — all of that can be affecting retail in ways that are causing [retailers] to have to make strategic changes.” All told, the wave of layoffs has cast a pall heading into the peak holiday shopping season, retail’s busiest time of year. It’s been a tough year for the industry thanks to stubborn inflation, bleak consumer sentiment and President Donald Trump’s trade war — the U.S. average tariff rate is at its highest level since 1934, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University. Retail’s corporate belt-tightening ahead of the holidays underscores the pressure consumer companies are under to drive sales and maintain profitability in a tough economic climate. “Retailers are simply trying to do more with less,” said Sky Canaves, a retail analyst at eMarketer. The timing of October’s layoffs is particularly striking given how close they are to the holiday shopping season. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” Challenger said in the report. “With the onset of social media, and the ability for workers to share their negative experiences with their employers, the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays — a practice that seemed particularly cruel — fell away.” Retailers are also pulling back on holiday hiring. Companies are expected to add fewer than 500,000 seasonal positions this year — the lowest since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Several retailers, including Kohl’s and Target, have declined to disclose their 2025 seasonal hiring plans, a departure from previous years. Some companies plan to keep the seasonal hiring levels unchanged from 2024. Amazon said it plans to hire 250,000 workers for the peak holiday season, while Bath & Body Works announced plans to hire 32,000 workers, the same as last year for both companies. “While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge,” Challenger said. He added that seasonal employers are contending with a mix of challenges this year, including lingering inflation and tariffs. As such, companies are increasingly relying on automation and permanent staff over large waves of seasonal hires. “It’s not that people aren’t going to stores — foot traffic isn’t expected to fall much — but with fewer staff, the quality of the consumer experience could suffer.” EMarketer’s Canaves warned that leaner staffing could become a self-fulfilling cycle. “When shoppers have bad experiences in stores because they can’t get sales help or the lines are too long, they’re less likely to return,” she said Still, expectations for consumer spending power during the holidays offer a glimmer of hope. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales will surpass $1 trillion for the first time in 2025, rising 3.7-4.2% over last year. EMarketer’s own forecast is slightly more conservative at $1.369 trillion, up 3.6% year-over-year. Canaves said the outlook remains solid because “people keep spending even if they have to borrow or use payment plans like buy-now, pay-later to do so.” But that spending strength is increasingly uneven. “We’re kind of seeing a K-shaped consumer economy, where upper-income consumers are spending more and lower-income consumers are spending less,” she said. Amazon’s latest layoffs mark the company’s most sweeping since 2022. The tech and retail giant more than doubled its workforce during the pandemic, expanding from roughly 800,000 employees in 2019 to more than 1.6 million by 2021 to meet surging e-commerce demand. Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s recent report flagged cost-cutting and artificial intelligence as the primary drivers behind the October layoffs. However, Amazon CEO Andy Jasy told analysts on a quarterly earnings call last week that the e-commerce giant’s latest layoffs were about “culture,” not finance or AI. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, … you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy said. Reducing those layers is all part of Amazon’s mission to operate “like the world’s largest startup,” he added. While the cuts affect everything from software engineering to video games to advertising, retail management roles were hit hardest, according to internal data cited by Business Insider. That may reflect a broader sea change within Amazon, as its retail business now accounts for just 40.5% of total revenue, down from 60% in 2018, per e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse. Target’s restructuring followed a similar rationale. The company previously told Modern Retail its decision to cut roughly 1,000 team members and leave another 800 roles unfilled was meant to speed up decision-making rather than save money.“ The complexity we’ve created over time has been holding us back,” Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer and incoming CEO, told employees in an email the company provided to Modern Retail. “Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.” For the latest Inside the publisher C-Suite series, Digiday spoke to Forbes CEO Sherry Phillips on its AI-era playbook, starting with its AI-powered dynamic paywall to new creator-led commercial opportunities.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: AppLovin’s AI-fueled surge and The Trade Desk’s stumble show where investors are placing their bets

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → AppLovin and The Trade Desk emerged as the clear attention-grabbers in this ad tech earnings window — but for very different reasons, and with very different signals about how investors are reading the sector’s future. AppLovin stock, FTW AppLovin’s third-quarter numbers were the kind that usually end an argument. Revenue jumped 68% year over year to $1.4 billion, with net income and adjusted EBITDA growing even faster as the company leans into its AXON-driven advertising platform and shrinks its legacy gaming footprint. The market’s reaction was briskly positive, as the company’s stock popped (see table below). However, what makes that reaction stand out is what it seemed to ignore. Just a month earlier, a Bloomberg report revealed that the U.S. SEC was probing AppLovin’s data-collection practices, following short-seller allegations that it skirted platform terms to squeeze more targeting out of Meta and mobile ecosystems. The stock fell about 14% on that headline in October, and further coverage detailed how the company shut down an “Array” product that had become a focal point of those accusations. Yet when the Q3 numbers hit, Wall Street effectively compartmentalized the regulatory overhang, although, some analysts explicitly advised caution: growth forecasts point to a deceleration from the current breakneck pace, and the SEC probe is still unresolved. But for now, the combination of scale, margins and AI narrative appears to outweigh the governance red flags in investors’ models. Big Tech vs. The open web Meanwhile, The Trade Desk’s Q3 tells a more nuanced tale about sentiment toward the demand side of the ecosystem. The company delivered $739 million in revenue, up 18% year over year (22% excluding U.S. political spend), beating consensus and continuing its long streak of double-digit top-line growth. CTV outpaced the rest of the business, and video now accounts for roughly half of revenue, underscoring The Trade Desk’s role as the de facto DSP for the “open internet.” And yet, the stock fell 4–7% in the wake of the results, depending on which post-earnings snapshot you look at. Coverage framed it as a classic “great quarter, high bar”: the company beat on revenue and EPS, guided Q4 to at least $840 million, but is still working off a bruising summer reaction to its Q2 earnings. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, CEO Jeff Green again insisted Amazon isn’t a direct competitor because most of its ads target owned-and-operated inventory rather than the “open internet.” However, investors appear split on that framing, with some seeing an independent DSP with durable CTV and retail-media momentum; others worry that Big Tech and retailer networks can squeeze the open web on both inventory and data. The Q3 sell-off doesn’t signal that the market has “given up” on The Trade Desk — but it does show that continued backing for the sector’s flagship DSP now depends on more than just beating the quarter. The story investors are buying has to reconcile competition from Amazon, Google and retailer media with a credible path to sustained 20%-ish growth and healthy cash generation. Collaboration across the middle layers of ad tech is another trend investors are monitoring, and while not explicitly raised on the call, the fact that concerned parties are seeking a “grand bargain” to end months, if not years, of sniping over supply-path and auction mechanics is likely welcome. Against that backdrop, The Trade Desk and PubMatic — which reported its own Q3 earnings as Digiday was going to press (see chart) — announced a new API-based integration for deal-ID campaigns using The Trade Desk’s Price Discovery and Provisioning, or PDP, API. Observers have characterized the move as a pragmatic reset: both sides acknowledge that legacy deal-ID plumbing is too brittle for modern CTV and curated marketplaces, and are willing to align on common pipes to keep spend flowing. For markets, deals like this suggest that even when buy- and sell-side rhetoric turns heated, the largest players will still cut operational truces where there’s real money on the table. In a sector where investors have been burned by opaque auctions and fee stacks, cleaner integrations that promise more predictable yield and fewer failed deals are a modest but meaningful de-risking signal. ‘Death of the open web’ narrative The other axis driving valuations is how convincingly companies can connect AI to revenue — and how quickly they can prove it on the open web, not just in pitch decks. DoubleVerify’s Q3 is a case in point. Revenue grew 11% to about $189 million and margins remained robust, but sales came in a touch light versus some expectations, and Q4 guidance implied high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. The stock promptly dropped around 19%. On the company’s earnings call, DoubleVerify leaned hard into its new DV AI Verification suite: Agent-ID to classify LLM agents and bots, and “AI SlopStopper” to detect and block synthetic or manipulated media across the open web. Management framed AI not just as a risk but as a margin lever, arguing that generative tools can 20x–2000x labeling productivity while opening new revenue lines in social, CTV and LLM-mediated advertising. Analysts pressed on how quickly those innovations could move the growth needle, and DV sketched a medium-term goal of taking social, streaming TV and AI verification from under 30% of revenue to roughly 50%. The share-price reaction suggests investors believe the strategy, but aren’t yet prepared to pay up for it without clearer acceleration. Elsewhere, Teads, provided the cautionary mirror image. Its Q3 revenue came in around $319 million, missing expectations and down roughly 15% year over year on a pro-forma basis, with EPS swinging to a loss — and the stock slumped by about 30%. On its earnings call, management laid out a turnaround plan targeting $35 million in annualized EBITDA improvement and highlighted CTV and AI-driven initiatives as the growth engine. Analysts focused heavily on how quickly Teads could stabilize core markets like the U.S., U.K., and France and whether its AI and CTV bets would stem share loss to rivals. The verdict from Wall Street — at least for now — is that execution risk is high, with the highly leveraged 2024 deal that led to the union of Outbrain and Teads, plus the “death of the open web” narrative, dragging down its stock price. In total, the above developments from last week point to a more nuanced view of ad tech’s prospects, rather than the blanket enthusiasm (or cynicism) of past cycles. On one side are scaled platforms such as AppLovin and The Trade Desk, which can still post high-teens to high-double-digit growth, invest aggressively in AI and CTV, and throw off substantial cash. On the other hand, there are infrastructure and media players that must prove AI is more than a cost line — that it can deepen moats in measurement, verification, and curated inventory rather than simply compressing margins. “Every player is optimizing for their own incentives instead of the health of the ecosystem. And somewhere in that noise, publishers — the ones creating the content and context that make advertising possible — are being left out.” – Renowned industry consultant, Jana Meron, of Lioness Strategies, says the quiet part out loud. News Corp explores multi-LLM licensing playbook News Corp is scoping out the potential for a multi-licensing LLM portfolio strategy, according to sources familiar with the matter. Ranking is out, visibility is in as publishers chip away at AI search optimization The AI search era is rewiring the goal from ranking to visibility, and publishers are slowly but steadily tuning their playbooks.

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. CoreWeave needed a lot of things to go right on Monday as it released third-quarter financial results, and one of the most critical was showing that its contracted future revenues could hit a $50 billion target Wall Street had set as a benchmark for the AI data-center and infrastructure operator. In its announcement, CoreWeave confirmed it nearly doubled its revenue backlog, which includes “remaining performance obligations” (RPOs) and other amounts it estimates will be recognized as revenue, to $55.6 billion, up from $30 billion the previous quarter. The surging backlog, which represents future revenues from customers, was driven by contracts with Meta, OpenAI, and French AI startup Poolside. Earnings and revenue, meanwhile, both beat analysts’ consensus estimates. The company also reported an increase in the debt on its balance sheet, however, and it revised its full-year revenue guidance downward. Following its earnings release and call with analysts, the stock dropped 6% in after-hours trading. Some investors have trained a gimlet eye on CoreWeave as more skeptics kick the tires of the booming AI trade and the concurrent infrastructure buildout. Concerns about CoreWeave, which some see as a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up, and about the AI build-out in general have sent the stock on a journey that has seen it tumble more than 30% from mid-August highs. The downward revision in revenue guidance reflected delays in construction of some of CoreWeave’s data centers. “While we are experiencing relentless demand for our platform, data center developers across the industry are also enduring unprecedented pressure across supply chains,” CEO Michael Intrator said during the analysts’ call. “In our case, we are affected by temporary delays related to a third-party data-center developer who is behind schedule.” Chief financial officer Nitin Agrawal offered full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion, down slightly from the guidance Intrator offered on the second-quarter earnings call, of between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. The customer impacted by the delay agreed to adjust the delivery schedule and extend the expiration date, Intrator said, which means CoreWeave will maintain the total value of the original contract. Agrawal said the company’s 2025 capex spending would be between $12 billion to $14 billion, down significantly from the $20 billion to $23 billion Intrator forecast last quarter. However, Agrawal said CoreWeave expects 2026 capex to soar. “Given the significant growth in our backlog and continued insatiable demand for our cloud services, we expect capex in 2026 to be well in excess of double that of 2025,” Agrawal said. CoreWeave reported revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter, up from $584 million in the same quarter last year and beat analysts’ estimates. Profitability, at least by traditional GAAP measures, remains elusive. CoreWeave reported a net loss of $110 million, although it was an improvement over its $359.8 million loss in the third quarter last year and also better than analysts expected. Adjusted net loss, which shows financial performance without extraordinary items, was $41 million for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year when it was break-even, Agrawal said. Adjusted EBITDA, which shows earnings without certain one-time expenses, were $838 million in the third quarter, compared to $379 million in Q3 2024. Operating income, a metric that shows profit from core businesses, fell to $51.9 million, compared to the same quarter last year when it was $117.1 million. Operating margins shrunk to 4% from 20%. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income, which shows a different view on core business performance, was $217 million for the third quarter, compared to $125 million in the third quarter of 2024, said Agrawal, the CFO. CoreWeave’s third quarter adjusted operating margin was 16%, due to higher revenues, lower costs, and the timing of data center deliveries from third parties. While Monday was just this side of positive for CoreWeave, analysts who are bearish on the AI cloud computing company remain leery of its finances. They see the company as at risk of being overwhelmed by the significant financial commitments it has taken on to build out data centers, which currently look disproportionately large compared to its revenues and cash flow. Based on its latest earnings release, CoreWeave has $9.7 billion in bills due within the next 12 months on its balance sheet, and a total of $14 billion in current and longer-term debt. Last quarter, those figures were $7.6 billion and $11 billion, respectively. CoreWeave also has $34 billion in scheduled lease payments on contracts that will commence between now and 2028. Interest expense reached $311 million for the quarter, nearly triple the figure from the year-earlier period, of $104 million. CoreWeave bulls, meanwhile, remain confident that revenues from the company’s book of contracts will eventually far outstrip its debt obligations. During the past three months, CoreWeave has announced a spate of significant deals, booking a $14.2 billion deal to provide Meta with computing capacity and an agreement with Poolside for a data center with 40,000 of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: CoreWeave’s stock wavers on data center delay and lower revenue forecast

UPDATED 18:36 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Artificial intelligence compute infrastructure company CoreWeave Inc. delivered better-than-expected financial results today, but its stock lost ground after-hours when it revealed a tepid revenue forecast and said one of its third-party developers has fallen behind schedule on a key data center facility. The company reported a third-quarter loss before certain costs such as stock compensation of 22 cents per share, easily beating Wall Street’s estimate of a 40-cent-per-share loss. Revenue for the period rose by an impressive 134%, to $1.36 billion, also surpassing the analysts’ target of $1.29 billion. The increased revenue had the effect of narrowing CoreWeave’s net loss considerably to just $110 million, down from a $360 million loss in the year-ago period. CoreWeave Chief Executive Michael Intrator (pictured) said the company’s results are a reflection of its disciplined execution across every part of its business. “CoreWeave’s position as the essential cloud for AI has never been stronger as we drive growth through focus and innovation to power the next generation of AI,” he added. The fortunes of CoreWeave are tied directly to those of the AI industry, because the company specializes in renting out access to Nvidia Corp.’s graphics processing units and has secured numerous multibillion-dollar deals with key cloud infrastructure providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC. The company said its backlog stood at $55.6 billion at the end of the quarter, with 2.9 gigawatts in power under contract, up from 2.2 gigawatts three months earlier. The company made some big announcements during the quarter, notably including a $6.5 billion expansion of its partnership with OpenAI Group PBC. It also signed a new, six-year deal with Meta Platforms Inc. that could ultimately be worth up to $14.2 billion, along with another contract from an undisclosed “leading hyperscaler.” Despite the progress on the deal front, Intrator told analysts on a conference call that the company remains “supply-constrained.” He explained that the problem has to do with partly completed “powered-shell” data centers where the company intends to set up its own infrastructure. Intrator also admitted that one of the company’s third-party contractors has fallen behind schedule. He told analysts that the delay in construction won’t impact the company’s backlog, because the customer affected by the holdup has agreed to adjust its delivery schedule. The original value of the contract will be maintained, he added. “There was a problem at one data center that’s impacting us, but there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” Intrator pointed out. However, one problem with that delay is that it’s likely going to hurt CoreWeave’s near-term fortunes. The company offered a full-year revenue forecast of between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, below Wall Street’s target of $5.29 billion. CoreWeave has enjoyed a wild ride since going public on the Nasdaq in March, when it sold its shares at a price of $40 each. The stock closed at $105.61, representing a gain of more than 165%, only to fall almost 6% in late trading today. Still, it continues to outperform the Nasdaq by a long way, with the broader index up just 32% over the same period. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research praised CoreWeave, not only for its “outstanding growth” but also for proving the many skeptics in the AI industry wrong, as it made great strides towards profitability. “Its earnings-per-share loss improved considerably, and with another quarter like this it should be in the black,” the analyst said. Having demonstrated it has a viable business, CoreWeave now needs to focus on carefully managing its growth, the analyst believes. “The focus has to shift to following the supply chain, delivering more data center capacity and running customer workloads successfully,” he said. “At the moment, it does face some challenges, with delays in one of its data center build outs, and this will need to be addressed.” Despite its impressive progress, CoreWeave has had its share of disappointments. Last month shareholders of the data center infrastructure company Core Scientific Inc. voted to decline a $9 billion acquisition offer, claiming it was undervalued and didn’t recognize its growth potential. CoreWeave chose not to increase its offer, and so the deal has been terminated. “We respect the decision of Core Scientific’s stockholders regarding our previously announced merger agreement,” CoreWeave said in a statement. “Our partnership with Core Scientific remains strong and will continue to execute on shared growth opportunities. CoreWeave’s vision and strategy remain unchanged.” Nevertheless, CoreWeave is still planning to spend lots of money in the coming months, acquisitions or not. On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal said the company’s capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 will be “well in excess of double” its $12 billion to $14 billion forecast for the current year.

Title: After Multiple Delays, AST SpaceMobile's Prototype Satellite to Launch in December

After several months of delays, AST SpaceMobile looks ready to launch its first next-gen “BlueBird” satellite before the end of the year as it competes with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink effort. In an earnings report on Monday, AST SpaceMobile said the BlueBird 6 satellite, also known as FM1, is expected to launch in the first half of December. India’s space agency, ISRO, also told local media that the satellite is scheduled to fly in the second week of December. AST first aimed to launch its first batch of next-generation BlueBird satellites in Q1 2024. But it later said it planned on only launching one next-gen BlueBird, a prototype called the FM1, in Q2, before pushing that back three times, with some concern it might not occur until January. Monday's announcement pegs the launch to early next month. The company hasn’t explained the delay. But the second-generation BlueBird satellites are about three times larger than AST’s first-gen models, and will each span at over 2,000 square feet, making them exceptionally large and heavy. In addition, the US Federal Communications Commission only granted the company an experimental license to test the FM1 back in July, following objections from rival SpaceX. Despite the delays, AST is indicating it plans on launching another second-generation BlueBird, dubbed the FM2 soon, possibly in December. “BlueBird 7 (FM2) expected to ship to Cape Canaveral in November with orbital launch anticipated shortly thereafter,” the company said in the earnings report. Ironically, SpaceX has been contracted to launch FM2 using a Falcon 9 rocket. The satellites are crucial to AST’s business of supplying satellite connectivity to everyday phones, including powering messaging and video chats in cellular dead zones. AST has entered into partnerships with AT&T and Verizon to supply the satellite service to customers sometime next year. However, AST has repeatedly said it needs between 45 to 60 satellites in orbit to offer continuous service across the US. So, launching enough satellites on time is crucial to the company’s effort to compete with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink, which is already available through T-Mobile and soon Boost Mobile. For now, AST is saying it’s “on track for five orbital launches expected by the end of Q1 2026, with launches every one to two months on average to reach [a] goal of 45 to 60 satellites by end of 2026.” In an earnings call, the company also said it was "fully funded" for a total of 100 plus satellites to improve the constellation's coverage and capabilities globally. In the call, AST executives also mentioned that a single SpaceX Falcon 9 has the capacity to carry around three next-generation BlueBird satellites. Meanwhile, Blue Origin's more powerful New Glenn should be able to carry an estimated 8. The company also agreed with an estimate that the AST constellation can kick off beta tests in North America once it has around 25 satellites in orbit. Editor's note: This story has been corrected to say the New Glenn vehicle should be able to carry an estimated 8, not 18 BlueBird satellites. My ExperienceI've been a journalist for over 15 years.

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The media giant’s revenue was flat at $6.7 billion, weighed down by declines in TV advertising and distribution In its first quarter since the closing of Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition, Paramount swung to a loss of $257 million as revenue growth was flat at $6.7 billion. The results for its third quarter, which were weighed down by declines in linear TV advertising and distribution, included a $13 million loss under its new owner Skydance and $244 million under the media giant’s previous leadership. The company reported $2.58 billion in revenue for the quarter under previous leadership and $4.12 billion under new leadership. Despite missing Wall Street expectations, Paramount shares jumped 6% in after-hours trading on Monday as the David Ellison-led media giant raised its cost savings target to $3 billion and outlined its vision for the future. “While we’re still in the early stages, this is only day 96,” Paramount CEO David Ellison told analysts during the company’s earnings call. “We’re energized by the progress we’ve made and the clear path ahead.” Here are the results: Net loss: A loss of $257 million, compared to a profit of $1 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share: Loss of 37 cent per share, with an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share, compared to earnings of 38 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Revenue: $6.7 billion, compared to $6.99 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance. Streaming subscribers: Added 1.4 million subscribers for a total of 79.1 million globally. Starting in the fourth quarter, Paramount will no longer include free trialers in its total subscriber count. As of the end of the third quarter, free trialers totaled 1.2 million. Revenue in its streaming business grew 17% year-over-year to $2.17 billion, driven by a 24% increase in Paramount+ revenue to $1.77 billion. Paramount’s streaming business posted a profit of $340 million, including $105 million pre-merger and $235 million post-merger, compared to $49 million a year ago. But the TV Media segment was a drag on the overall results, with revenue falling 12% to $3.8 billion, driven by a 12% decline in advertising on lower political spending and underreported revenue from an international sales partner in 2024; a 7% decline in affiliate revenue due to cord-cutting; and a 22% decline in licensing and other revenue due to the timing of content delivery. The segment posted a profit of $822 million, down from a profit of $936 million a year ago. Filmed Entertainment revenue grew 30% to $756 million, primarily due to the consolidation of Skydance licensing and other revenue. However, the segment swung to a loss of $49 million due to lower than expected performance of its film slate during the quarter, with disappointments like “Smurfs” and “The Naked Gun.” The latest quarterly results come as the company has submitted three separate bids to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, which ranged between $19 and $23.50 per share and were rejected for being too low. It also comes on the heels of Paramount’s $150 million purchase of Bari Weiss’ The Free Press. Paramount has raised its cost savings target to $3 billion, up from $2 billion previously. That plan has included roughly 1,000 layoffs thus far, with additional cuts to come at a later date. In addition to the formal layoffs, Paramount will begin a phased return to office in January. Approximately 600 employees chose voluntary severance packages in its first phase. More than $1.4 billion in savings will have been generated between the merger closing in August and the end of 2025, with an additional $1 billion plus in cost savings planned for 2026. It expects to complete those cuts by the end of 2027, generating approximately $800 million in 2026 and between $400 million and $500 million in 2027. In addition to labor, the media giant is also looking at areas such as real estate, procurement and workflow to find efficiencies. As part of a “comprehensive strategic review” of its assets, Paramount recently divested the Argentinian free-to-air network Telefe and is in the process of divesting Chilevision in Chile, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2026. These divestitures will reduce the company’s workforce by approximately 1,600 additional employees. At the same time, Paramount plans to invest in excess of $1.5 billion in programming in 2026, including streaming investment in the UFC, Paramount+ originals, third-party catalog licensing and ramping up its film slate, with plans to target at least 15 movies per year over the next few years. The company has set new deals with the UFC, Professional Bull Riders and Zuffa Boxing, greenlit new series such as Jeremy Strong’s “9/12” and Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning’s “Discretion,” and forged partnerships with“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, The Duffer Brothers, Will Smith and James Mangold. Though Taylor Sheridan is set to exit the company after his contract expires in 2028, he has also been tapped to work on a film adaptation of video game franchise “Call of Duty” with Peter Berg. Paramount also plans to raise prices for Paramount+ in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. Leadership has said they would look to transform Paramount into a technological leader in entertainment, with plans to use tools like virtual production and AI, which would increase efficiencies, help with search, discovery and recommendations and boost content creation. “We really view AI as a tool for artists to be able to iterate more quickly, to be able to tell better stories and basically create even further accessibility, really, across the entire content creation pipeline,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we think technology is going to impact all aspects of our business and we want to be a leader in that space.” Paramount will also leverage Skydance’s existing relationship with David’s father Larry Ellison’s Oracle, which the company has paid $2 million for software support agreements and database licenses since the merger closed. Paramount+, Pluto TV and BET+ will move to a unified backend infrastructure by mid-2026 and the media giant will use a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) system by early 2027, which David Ellison said would lead to “significant operational efficiency” across the company and “give better real-time information to managers.” “The better visibility you have in terms of how the company is doing on a day-to-day basis, that improves your decision making. So we’re in the process of deploying that,” he added. Ellison has argued the Paramount would be the “best partner” for WBD, adding that other potential acquirers would need to overcome “significant (perhaps insurmountable) hurdles given their dominant market positions.” In an Oct. 13 letter to WBD’s board, Paramount argued that the value to shareholders in a break-up would be less than $15 per share or roughly $18 to $20 per share including a “robust, yet highly uncertain, M&A premium for Warner Bros,” an individual familiar with the matter confirmed to TheWrap. In order to sweeten the bid, Ellison even offered Warner CEO David Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman title, as well as increasing the portion of the bid paid in cash to shareholders from 60% to 80% and increasing the breakup fee from $2 billion to $2.1 billion. CNBC reported that Paramount is also considering taking a tender offer directly to WBD shareholders and formalizing a hostile bid for the company. If successful in acquiring WBD, TheWrap previously reported that Ellison would look to merge HBO Max and Paramount+ into a “super platform” under one scenario being considered. The theatrical model is also at the core of his vision and a combined company would look to target an output of 30 films per year as part of its commitment to that model. “It’s important to know that there’s no must-haves for us — we really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call when asked about WBD and the company’s M&A strategy. “We believe we can achieve our goals with our creative content engines, we believe we can achieve our streaming goals and that we can drive enterprise efficiency and create value and long term free cash flow generation all through the building standpoint.” Ellison said Paramount would make M&A decisions that tie back into its core principles. “We’re fortunate that we have the balance sheet to be able to be opportunistic when we think that M&A will accelerate our goals, but we’re also long term disciplined owner operators,” Ellison said. “So from that standpoint, we’ll always approach things through the lens of how do we maximize value for shareholders.” Paramount president Jeff Shell also reiterated that the company would hang onto its cable networks. “This company has a history of spinning assets and it hasn’t gone very well for us and we think for others,” Shell explained. “One of the big rationales for a spin is that when companies are standalone, they can focus on driving the value of the brands that they have in a more specific way. We are going to do that, but we’re going to do that within our company so our shareholders get the value of that.” He also noted that the declines in broadcast are “very modest” compared to cable and that its content is “increasingly a huge driver” for streaming subscriber growth and engagement. Shell said the company plans to increase its investments in CBS and look at its brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET to see if it can “transform those businesses in a digital way to drive value long term and make them increasing pieces of our overall scale and global streaming strategy.” Looking ahead, Paramount expects $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in revenue, or growth of 1% to 4% year over year, for the fourth quarter, driven by strength in streaming offset by declines in the TV Media and Filmed Entertainment segments. It also expects $500 million to $600 million in adjusted operating income. Additionally, the company anticipates a restructuring charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter related to its “realignment and transformation.” Paramount+ net adds are expected to come in lower than the third quarter due to the termination of two international hard bundles. On a full year basis, it expects streaming to be profitable in 2025, but losses in the fourth quarter due to “seasonally-weighted content costs.” Theatrical revenue is also expected to be down as it reworks its film slate and is impacted by the comparison to “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” Starting in the first quarter of 2026, Paramount will change its reporting structure to reflect its reorganization. The move will house all production and IP in one place with Studios, including almost all licensing revenue, while the remaining TV Media segment will be comprised of its broadcasting and cable businesses. For 2026, it is forecasting $30 billion in revenue, a 4% increase from the midpoint of its 2025 forecast, driven by streaming revenue growth due to price increases and the termination of additional international hard bundles, and adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion, driven by progress in cost-cutting and investments in content and technology. The company expects a “more moderate” decline in linear advertising versus 2025 due to political spending in 2026, new ad agency partnerships, the sale of Telefe and the planned sale of Chilevision. It also expects to grow streaming profitability in 2026, driven by the UFC, South Park and “several hundred million” dollars of investment in film and series for Paramount+, and return to profitability in its Filmed Entertainment segment on a full-year basis in 2026. Paramount expects to return to investment grade debt metrics by the end of 2027. The company ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.6 billion in gross debt. It also has $433 million in debt maturing over the next 12 months.

Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. A leading investment bank has delivered an arresting diagnosis of the U.S. economy: the labor market, long a pillar of resilience, may be in real trouble. In their latest economic outlook, UBS economists led by Jonathan Pingle painted a picture of mounting weakness that extends well beyond headline job numbers, warning of a growing risk to households and the broader recovery. The latest “US Economics Weekly” note from the Swiss investment bank came with bated breath ahead of the impending end of the federal government shutdown. Economists and market-watchers have been deprived of federal economic data for over 40 days, something that former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erica Groshen likened to “flying blind” in late October. If the government does reopen, Pingle’s team said it expects jobs data for September to be released next week, and potentially the October inflation report, the Consumer Price Index. Economists need that data now more than ever. For much of the year, top economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have said we’re in a “low hire, low fire” jobs market. For much of the year, employers were laconic in hiring, and seemed afraid to fire their workers; perhaps still wounded from the pandemic-era “Great Resignation.” UBS isn’t alone on Wall Street in worrying that, maybe the “low-fire” part of the equation isn’t quite true anymore. Now, “there are plenty of available workers that, on the whole, businesses probably don’t feel the need to hold on to workers for longer than necessary,” Veronica Clark, a Citigroup Inc. economist, told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas, also told Bloomberg that “you’ve got a substantial number of well-established companies making pretty big head cuts.” Firing is running higher than advertised, UBS argued, citing the fact that “unemployment insurance claims, layoff announcements and WARN notices have all been running ahead of the pre-pandemic pace. Even the lagged Business Employment Dynamics data, the gold standard of data on job creation and job destruction dynamics has been showing the pace of job loss at or above the pre-pandemic pace through the latest data.” Indeed, cuts have accelerated sharply. October saw 157,000 layoffs announced by corporations, per industry standard Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the highest monthly total since July 2020. Technology and warehousing were hit especially hard, with cuts also linked to automation and artificial intelligence.​ The year-to-date tally? A startling 760,000 seasonally adjusted cuts through October, far outpacing the same period in 2024 and running higher than any year since 2009 — the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. Major companies are taking action: Amazon cut 14,000 corporate roles, UPS has slashed 48,000 jobs over the past year, and Target eliminated nearly 2,000 staff in a single sweep.​ Workers are getting thrown into a growing pool of others not finding jobs. UBS likens the job market to a bathtub: with outflows (layoffs) steady and inflows (hiring) slowing, the water level (total jobs) is bound to fall. The hiring rate, as measured by multiple business surveys, has dropped to levels historically seen only in recessions. Excluding healthcare and social assistance, which have been relatively steady, private-sector payrolls have been declining by an average of 36,000 jobs per month. Since the start of the year, household employment as measured by the main government survey has been falling by about 72,000 jobs per month through August. Such a pace is “well below” the rate required to keep up with population growth, let alone maintain a stable unemployment rate, which has now crept up to a post-2021 high. Labor force participation has slipped, and more than 800,000 people have left the labor force but say they still want a job.​ Economists note the broadest measure of underemployment, known as U-6, has jumped by 0.6 percentage points since January to 8.1%. That’s now 1.3 percentage points higher than at the end of 2019. Notably, the rise isn’t just about people out of work: more Americans are working part-time for economic reasons, another classic sign of slackening demand. “That is exactly the opposite of what should happen under a negative labor supply shock stemming from immigration,” UBS wrote, referring to the Trump administration’s argument that immigration restrictions would tighten the labor market. Job openings continue to decline: as of the end of October, Indeed.com reported that postings had sunk to their lowest level since 2021, with almost every sector seeing year-over-year drops. Meanwhile, the weekly average of initial unemployment claims is running above 2023’s level and continuing claims are nearing a post-pandemic high.​ And even the openings that appear active, Pingle argued, may not be tied to real hiring efforts. The hiring rate “consistent with recession” has been a gap “so large that seemingly many of the openings probably are not seeing much effort to be filled,” according to Pingle. “We can also look at the 14 million people not working but who want a job or are searching for one, or the 2 million collecting unemployment benefits. Given that abundance, it would seem that at least some of the openings do not appear anxious to be filled.” Not only are workers losing jobs, but the market for new opportunities is shrinking as well. Seasonal hiring plans for the holidays are running well below pre-pandemic norms. Challenger, Gray & Christmas reports a combined September/October total of just 400,000 announced holiday roles — sharply lower than the 625,000 average for the 2014–19 period and even below recent years. Key retailers like Target aren’t even disclosing numbers, and the National Retail Federation suggests seasonal jobs could be down 40% from a year ago.​ This chill is hitting consumer and business sentiment. The University of Michigan’s consumer confidence reading dropped to 50.3 in November, barely above the all-time low set in 2022. Fewer households report jobs are plentiful, and the share expecting unemployment to rise over the next year has soared to levels not seen since the recession-scarred 1980s. Among small businesses, optimism is “struggling to gain traction” amid inflation fears and continued labor market turmoil.​ Federal Reserve officials are increasingly divided, with some policymakers warning that the risk to jobs now rivals concerns about inflation. While some see an argument for interest rate cuts to buffer the labor market, others worry inflation isn’t yet tamed. One Fed governor admitted she worries because “the labor market can deteriorate very quickly,” calling for caution and flexibility as each new set of economic data is released.​ The investment bank’s conclusion? If layoffs keep pace and hiring continues to slow, the labor market is headed for “more obvious contraction.” And that, they warn, could soon filter down to undermine household confidence, consumer spending — and the entire recovery. “If a bathtub is draining faster and faster while the faucet isn’t changed, eventually the water level is going to start to drop. That is a material risk to the outlook.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: We Compared Steak Prices Across 9 Grocery Stores – Here's Where You Can Find The Cheapest Cuts
URL: https://www.tastingtable.com/2017101/steak-grocery-store-prices-cheapest-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T14:20:00Z
Full Content:
Steak is sometimes thought of as a special treat, a fancy dinner, or simply out of reach. Since the price of steak has risen more than 40% since 2020, according to Visual Capitalist, that may seem like a safe assessment. But one reason prices are so high is simple supply and demand — people still want steak for dinner, special treat or not. But even though beef is increasingly in demand, U.S. cattle herds have diminished in size and drought has hurt supply — thus driving higher prices. The gold standard is to support your local farm or rancher. Buying from the source means reinvesting in growing herds, boosting supply, and ultimately, driving down costs. That said, if you're unable to source from your local farmer, there are a multitude of options at the grocery store. You can still snag quality steaks if you know where to look. The national average for steak in U.S. grocery stores is $12.26 per pound, but of course, this averages higher-end cuts like ribeye and strip with lower-end cuts like chuck and round and doesn't account for regional differences. So we did a deep dive and checked out prices across several popular grocery stores to find the cheapest cuts of steak. We looked at price per pound across each store's regional locations, factored each store's national average, and then compared them to see where you can get the cheapest cuts. Prices are as of the date of publication and may vary based on region. Aldi began as the world's first discount store and still remains one of the best places to find affordable items. So perhaps it's no surprise that Aldi comes in as the store with the cheapest cuts of steak when strictly comparing prices, though its prices are a little higher than the national average for U.S. supermarkets. The biggest drawback is that Aldi doesn't offer many steak cuts, so your options are fairly limited. But you'll find basic cuts like ribeye, strip, sirloin, round, and skirt, and if you think the lower prices are indicative of lower quality meat, you would be mistaken. We think these are some of the best steak cuts you can buy at Aldi. Take, for instance, the almighty ribeye, one of the most coveted pieces of meat. A little higher than the overall supermarket national average for ribeye (about $10), you can score this most scrumptious cut for about $13 per pound, which is the cheapest ribeye on our list. Likewise, Aldi offers the cheapest New York strip (but on par with Trader Joe's) for $14.44. However, if you're looking for cheaper cuts than those, Aldi also offers top round and eye of round for about $8, and we think that's a valuable find. Similar to Aldi, Trader Joe's revolutionized discount food shopping by offering customers lower prices on specialty brands and private-label products. Its unique offerings could be one of the reasons you tend to buy more than what's on your shopping list when you visit a Trader Joe's. It may not be as cheap as Aldi, but you can certainly find affordable items, including cuts of steak. But like Aldi, your steak options are somewhat limited. You'll pay more for ribeye at Trader Joe's — the national average for the chain is $15.49 per pound. This is a few dollars more than Aldi and about $5 over the national supermarket average. New York strip is about the same price as Aldi, between $14 and $15, but sirloin comes in about a dollar cheaper than Aldi, making it your best option for this cut. If you're looking for a fancier cut of steak, maybe for a truly special dinner, then you're in luck. Trader Joe's features some of the most affordable filet mignon at $21.99, which is pretty close to the national average for all supermarkets. Walmart is well-known for its giant Supercenters, which feature endless aisles of food and drink, plus sprawling produce and deli sections. The iconic store is also known for its low prices and wide range of products, including name brands and private labels. If we were choosing an overall best option for variety and reasonable prices, Walmart would come out on top. It's easy to find a cut that you can both afford and enjoy. But comparing price to price, you'll pay more for ribeye, strip, and sirloin than you would at Aldi or Trader Joe's. However, in relation to the other stores on our list, you'll get the best deal on skirt steak at just over $10 per pound, porterhouse for $13.47, and flank for about $12 — all of which are a couple of dollars over the national supermarket average. Walmart is one of the few stores on our list to offer the most steak choices — from upscale cuts like ribeye, strip, and porterhouse to tougher cuts like chuck and various cuts of round. You can even source Wagyu ribeye and strip at Walmart for just under $28 per pound. Costco has come under fire from customers for rising beef prices, though, as stated previously, prices have risen just about everywhere. But when you pay for a store membership in order to, hopefully, cut bottom-line costs, it's disappointing when prices are actually higher than at stores that don't require a membership. The membership fee itself only equates to between $5 to $10 per month (before tax), but what's the point if it doesn't save you money in the long run? You just might be better off shopping for steak elsewhere. But Costco sells in bulk, and that's an obvious benefit over smaller, non-wholesale grocery stores. Even though prices are increasing at Costco, you'll find some of the cheapest ribeye (after Aldi), as well as some of the most affordable top round, tri-tip, and flank steak. So if you have a Costco membership, no worries; there are still plenty of options to choose from while sticking to a tight budget. And if you feel like splurging on a special cut of beef, consider the filet mignon, which is the cheapest on our list at $19.99 — on par with the national supermarket average. Bonus: Get Costco ground beef in bulk during the holiday season if you're after high-quality beef. Sam's Club is another wholesale, membership-based grocer with fees ranging from a couple of bucks to $10 per month, depending on the level you choose. It's also one of the best supermarkets to find certain cuts of steak at incredibly affordable prices. Though you'll pay more at Sam's Club for cuts like ribeye and strip than you would at Walmart and Costco (about $3 to $6 per pound more for ribeye and $1 more for strip), you'll pay less for chuck and round. Sam's Club also offers skirt, flank, and tri-tip at excellent prices: about $11, $11.50, and $10.50 per pound, respectively. Though you may not be as familiar with these cuts as ribeye, strip, or chuck, this could be a good time to practice your cooking skills. Buying in bulk at low cost is a less risky way to learn how to make a restaurant-worthy tri-tip steak or master the best way to serve up skirt steak. And don't forget to impress your friends and family with a grilled balsamic flank steak at your next gathering. Cheap steak doesn't have to mean bland steak. Publix is a well-loved Southern supermarket chain that has earned its reputation as a shopper's delight with its commitment to fresh food, in-house butchery, and BOGO deals that turn higher prices into instant bargains. Of course, it's also loved for specialty items like its Supreme Cakes and fried chicken. When it comes to steak cuts, Publix lands somewhere in the middle with its prices and options. After Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix offers some of the cheapest New York strip at about $17 per pound, which is on par with Costco and Walmart. But unlike Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix has a wider range of cuts to choose from. You'll find cuts like porterhouse and T-bones for around $17, sirloin, flat iron, and tri-tip for between $14 and $15, and chuck and round for roughly between $12 and $13. However, Publix is known for its sales, especially around the holidays, when standing rib roasts are marked down to $6.99 per pound. But instead of roasting the entire piece of meat, you can slice it into individual cuts of steak, and voilà, you've got yourself some seriously cheap ribeye. Albertsons was founded in 1939 as a one-stop market that focused on offering quality items at competitive prices. Today, it has continued that legacy by stocking a wide array of steak cuts, from premium ribeye and strip to the more affordable chuck and round. Albertsons caters to budget-conscious shoppers by offering frequent promotions. While it may not undercut deep-discount rivals like Walmart or Costco with its everyday pricing, the chain holds its own with mid-price steak cuts. The fact that it offers such a wide range makes it a great choice for those looking for variety. Comparatively speaking, Albertsons has some of the cheapest porterhouse and T-bone steaks for between $12 and $14, more affordable than Kroger, Publix, or Whole Foods. It also offers up some of the cheapest flat iron and tri-tip at about $11 per pound, giving you more ways to expand your meaty expertise. These under-the-radar cuts open up opportunities to create dishes like herby grilled flat iron steak and smoky tri-tip tacos, keeping both your stomach and wallet happy. Kroger got its start as the pioneer of in-house grocery store bakeries in 1883, and eventually expanded to thousands of locations. It has a long history of competing with the biggest supermarkets in the U.S. and still offers low prices on everyday selections. However, it's not one of the cheapest stores on our list when it comes to steak. Kroger may not shine when it comes to inexpensive, higher-quality cuts. Ribeye, strip, filet mignon, and sirloin are priced pretty high, with ribeye and strip costing an average of more than $20 per pound — but it does stock a handful of other cuts that are much more reasonably priced. So though you may not be rushing to grab the ribeye, Kroger features top and bottom round and eye of round, with price ranging from $9 to $12. Kroger stocks flat iron, skirt, flank, and tri-tip for under $15, which is comparable to Sam's Club, Costco, and Albertsons. Whole Foods isn't really a supermarket that comes to mind when you're talking about cheap cuts of steak, but it lands on our list for offering customers some of the cheapest cuts of round. For under $10 per pound, you can get eye of round steaks or the entire round. Top round is about $12 while tri-tip and sirloin hover around $15 or $16. Like most grocery stores, ribeye and strip are on the higher end at over $20 per pound. Whole Foods is mostly known for its sky-high standards for sourcing. That makes it tough to compare its flat iron steak to the run-of-the-mill version found at discount stores like Walmart or Costco. That said, the chain occasionally drops deals on premium cuts, matching the lower prices seen at the other stores on our list. Amazon Prime members receive discounts on selected items, but these may vary. To research steak prices for some of the most popular grocery stores in the U.S., we assessed the prices of 17 different cuts of steak across nine stores. We gathered prices for each cut at each store using multiple locations. To determine each store's national average, we compiled data from every region (if the store was located there). It was interesting to note that each store was pretty consistent with its pricing of steak across its locations. That's to say that the ribeye at Aldi generally costs the same at its locations in Florida and Oregon. We pulled the prices for the national average price per pound for retail steak across all supermarkets using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2024 National Beef Retail Report as a baseline. We also noted the various styles and grades available at each store on our list, which created a price range for many cuts.

Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The old proverb “new brooms sweep clean” is often misleadingly mentioned to suggest that new hires are more thorough. That drops the cautionary second part of the proverb that should not be ignored: “but an old broom knows the corners.” The wisdom of the full saying rings especially true when considering how the nascent turnaround effort at iconic retail chain Target appears to be coming into focus, despite widespread initial skepticism. While the path forward remains challenging, could Target’s turnaround be right on target despite all the naysayers? That skepticism apparently ran so deep, that merely two months ago, when Target announced that longtime, widely admired CEO Brian Cornell would be retiring and that 20-year company veteran Michael Fiddelke would take the reins, the stock immediately plummeted 8%, with sellside Wall Street analysts commenting that “investors were hopeful for an external hire,” and “this internal appointment does not remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and inward-looking mindset.” (Target stock is down by more than one-third year-to-date.) Despite Fiddelke’s resume – having originally started at Target over two decades ago as an intern, and working in practically every job at the company across retail, merchandising, operations, finance, and supply chain since – many seemed to have written him off from the start, primarily by virtue of his insider status. But could that have been premature? It’s understandable that investors often have a knee-jerk preference for outsiders to parachute into companies in turbulent times. We acknowledge there is never any one-size-fits-all solution – there are always certain situations where an outsider may be genuinely necessary to shake things up and clear the deck. For example, Cornell himself came to Target from PepsiCo when Target was mired in crisis amidst a costly data breach and plummeting revenues, and he got Target back to growth within a couple of years. But our new, original analysis of recent Fortune 500 CEO successions suggests that surprisingly, internal CEOs have been consistently outperforming external CEOs, with dramatic outperformance in terms of total shareholder return (TSR). We analyzed all CEO transitions taking place in the Fortune 500, and we found that of the 61 CEO transitions which took place over the last year, the 39 CEOs who were elevated from within, have generated an average TSR of 14.81% on an annualized basis, while the 22 CEOs who were selected from the outside have generated an average TSR of -9.01% on an annualized basis. Could that be a one-year fluke? We ran the numbers over a longer-term period, and found that the same trend consistently held true. We found that of the 93 CEO transitions which took place over the last one to three years, the 71 internal CEOs have generated a 10.16% average annualized return, while the 22 external CEOs have generated a 6.35% average annualized return. Likewise, of the 84 CEO transitions in the Fortune 500 which took place over the last three to five years, the 70 internal CEOs have generated a 12.68% average annualized return while the 13 external CEOs have generated a 6.42% average annualized return. Simply put, the data is clear that no matter how you slice and dice it, there has been dramatic stock outperformance by internal CEOs vs. external CEOs when it comes to recent Fortune 500 CEO transitions. The conclusions drawn from our original analysis of recent CEO performance closely parallel the findings of other renowned management and corporate governance scholars. In his 2007 book, “The CEO Within,” Harvard Business School’s Joseph Bower found that externally recruited CEOs often lack the in-depth knowledge of the company’s culture and history needed to succeed. Similarly, Stanford’s David Larcker and Brian Tayan found that the data consistently shows across decades that internal CEOs outperform external CEOs. Many scholars have found the same conclusion holds true over more discrete time periods even beyond the ones we measured, such as during the COVID pandemic. While there is never a one-size-fits-all prescription that works in all cases, the data seems to suggest that the greatest change agent CEOs tend to come from within – internal CEOs tend to have a deep understanding of their company, what makes it tick, and even more importantly, where the bodies are buried, and what needs to change – and with the know-how, cultural savvy, and buy-in needed to make tough decisions on day one. As he retires, Brian Cornell has much to be proud of as one of the most admired and accomplished CEOs in retail. During his decade-plus tenure, he has transformed Target from a beleaguered company beset by crises when he arrived, into a retail powerhouse with over $100 billion of revenue today; successfully transitioned Target into an omnichannel retailer with significant e-commerce capabilities; reinvigorated the company’s lucrative, higher-margin private brand business to the tune of more than $30 billion a year in sales; and expanded the company’s geographic footprint to nearly 2,000 fully owned stores. And while the current stock price doesn’t reflect all these achievements, he has bought back billions in stock while raising the dividend every year during his tenure; all while continuing Target’s commitment to dedicating 5% of its total profits to communities, which it has done without break since 1946. Cornell’s prescient, industry-leading strategy to invest in stores in 2017 to build them into e-commerce fulfillment hubs paid off massively, enabling exponential e-commerce growth at Target, especially early on during the pandemic, with consumers embracing Target’s same-day home delivery and drive by pick-up service. This business, which was virtually built from scratch, now generates $20 billion a year and is still rapidly growing. Derived from Target’s burgeoning e-commerce platform is Target’s digital advertising business, which now generates $2 billion a year for the company and is still rapidly growing as well. At the same time, the complexity of running stores as distribution centers has created gaps in the store experience, and Target needs to provide consumers with a more premium, consistent shopping experience. Fiddelke will need to navigate a challenging road forward for Target, which has seen sales stagnate since peaking three years ago. Target has a higher mix of consumer discretionary products vis a vis competitors such as Walmart and Costco, whose product mix lean more towards consumer staples. This benefits Target when its merchandise is trend setting and differentiated, but can also be a headwind when consumers are stretched or managing budgets tightly. Fiddelke’s emphasis on restoring Target’s style authority may be the biggest factor in driving future growth here. Regardless, there is just no mistaking the magnitude of Target’s current challenges. To succeed, Fiddelke will need to put forward a comprehensive turnaround strategy as 2026 beckons, with the planned CEO transition looming in February 2026. Consumer spending is showing signs of slowing down amidst market share losses to key competitors, and Target will need to do a better job of both providing value to the financially stressed consumer; while also better differentiating its discretionary products to recapture higher spending consumers. Target needs to recapture its reputation for combining style, quality and value in a way other retailers don’t. There are some potential growth enhancers. While Target’s loyalty program, Target Circle, has over 100 million members; investors will be looking to see how Fiddelke can better leverage those memberships. Unlike Walmart or Amazon, Target Circle is free to join, and there is a big opportunity for Target to increase the offerings and value to attract more consumers while further monetizing the platform. Target has been testing different promotions, personalized offers, gamifying rewards, free gifts and working to increase awareness of the benefits, with a focus of driving upper-level paid premium memberships that come with 5% discounts on purchases and unlimited same-day home delivery. These initiatives have the potential to not only accelerate digital growth but also drive overall traffic and sales growth. Similarly, there is a significant opportunity for Target’s third-party marketplace business, Target+, which enables outside vendors to sell products on its website with attractive profit margins to Target, to grow significantly in the years ahead. Fiddelke appears to be meeting these challenges head-on. Virtually all observers agreed that the recent news of Target laying off 8% of its corporate workforce was difficult but necessary in rightsizing Target’s workforce. Analysts at Jefferies noted, “This is an early signal that Fiddelke is willing to make tough calls. The layoffs are essential to restore agility and cost discipline. If paired with initiatives to reignite traffic and improve digital execution, these actions could lay the groundwork for a turnaround”. These initial green shoots of progress have been warmly welcomed, with Target stock up nearly 10% over the last month. Furthermore, Target is continuing exclusive premiers with blockbuster talent like Taylor Swift, who just released her new “Life of Showgirl” album with exclusive related merchandize items available only at Target, continuing a highly profitable enviable relationship since 2008. But that marks only the start, and much more is needed. To sustain momentum, Target will need to communicate an even more sweeping, comprehensive turnaround strategy covering all aspects of Fiddelke’s new strategy in detail, perhaps around a potential investor day next spring. Clearly, there is strong appetite for bold, decisive moves, even if it means ripping off the band-aid right up front and working through some transitory pain. Then, from there, all eyes will be on execution. While our original analysis suggests that internal CEOs tend to have stronger track records of execution, the onus will be on Fiddelke to show that this leadership team of experienced Target veterans can hit the bulls-eye once Target’s target is in sight.

Stock futures are surging this morning after U.S. lawmakers passed a key procedural hurdle as part of an agreement that could bring an end to the shutdown that has lasted nearly six weeks; President Donald Trump has proposed issuing $2,000 “dividend” checks to Americans that would be funded by revenue from tariffs; AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is set to release its quarterly results after the closing bell today; and shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that it would be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk (NVO). Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes after the Senate passed a key procedural vote as part of an agreement to end the more-than-month-long U.S. government shutdown. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were recently up 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.5%. The major market indexes lost ground last week amid cooling momentum behind the AI trade and heightened worries over the shutdown. Bitcoin was at nearly $106,000 in recent trading, up from a low over the weekend of around $101,500 and trading at its highest level in a week. Gold futures rose more than 2% to a two-week high of just above $4,100 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences a range of consumer loans, was at 4.13%, up from Friday's close of 4.09%. The Senate on Sunday passed a procedural hurdle that could clear a path for the government to reopen after the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The Senate voted 60-40 on a measure that allows other votes on an agreement that could restore funding to government agencies that have been shuttered for more than 40 days. Eight Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the agreement that would open the government through the end of January. While the agreement doesn’t address the healthcare funding cuts that were at the center of the shutdown, news reports said that there will be a vote on the subsidies in December. One consequence of the shutdown has been a freeze on economics reports from government statistical agencies, which could affect reports this week on inflation and retail sales. Government officials also began restricting some air travel last week amid staffing issues for air traffic controllers. President Donald Trump proposed issuing a $2,000 stimulus payment to Americans, saying in a social media post that tariff revenues could be used to fund the checks. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” In his post, Trump defended his tariff policies, which are currently being challenged in a Supreme Court case that challenges his authority to issue the import taxes. Earlier this year, allies of President Trump had proposed a "DOGE dividend” from savings from spending cuts. Artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report after markets close today, giving investors another look at the AI trade amid recent volatility. CoreWeave recently has announced a handful of deals with top tech firms, including a $6.3 billion initial order with AI chipmaker Nvidia and a $14.2 billion agreement with social media giant Meta. CoreWeave is expected to report that its revenue more than doubled over the year-ago period to $1.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. The firm is expected to post an adjusted loss per share of $0.35. Shares of CoreWeave, which have gained 160% since the company's initial public offering in March, were up nearly 5% in premarket trading. Shares of Metsera (MTSR) are plunging after the weight-loss drug maker announced that Pfizer (PFE) has agreed to acquire the company. Metsera said that it struck the deal with Pfizer after U.S. regulators raised worries that an offer from Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NVO) would create antitrust issues. The deal follows a reported bidding war between the two drug makers for New York-based Metsera. Pfizer will pay $86.25 per share in the transaction, which is reportedly valued at more than $10 billion. Metsera shares were down 15% ahead of the opening bell, while Pfizer shares ticked higher.

Title: When the AI Bubble Bursts, the Damage Will Be Severe

The AI bubble is both massive and nearing its end. At least that’s how we read the tea leaves. When it bursts…the damage is going to be profound, financially, economically and even politically. The AI bubble has gotten so massive and so complicated and so perversely organized that even the WSJ is having trouble figuring out how to describe the circular deals and money flows. When this bubble bursts, it will be the most damaging in US history, by far. The amounts involved are truly staggering, measured in the supposed market valuations of the top 5 companies – Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Google. Together, they are ‘worth’ more than $19 trillion. Nvidia alone is valued in the stock market at more than $5 trillion. But let’s back up for a moment. What is a bubble? This is my favorite definition: “A bubble exists when asset prices rise beyond what incomes can sustain.” Using this definition, consider AI leader OpenAI, which has a purported $13 billion in yearly revenue, but which is losing billions more on top of that, having made capital spending commitments with other AI companies totaling $1.4 trillion. The value of all the other involved companies has spiked on the news of the commitments, but where is that money going to come from? Nobody has yet said and OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, refuses to answer: Sam Altman appears tired of having to justify how OpenAI will pay for its trillion-dollar-plus spending commitments as a startup bringing in a fraction of that in annual revenue. In a testy moment during a recent podcast interview with investor Brad Gerstner on the “Bg2 Pod,” Altman was asked “the single biggest question” that is “hanging over the market.” “How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?” Gerstner asked the OpenAI CEO. “You’ve heard the criticism, Sam.” OpenAI has invested heavily in infrastructure and compute, striking multi-billion-dollar deals to secure more Nvidia chips and energy to fuel its AI ambitions. The latest came Monday morning, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion partnership with AWS. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said in response to Gerstner’s question. “Enough.” (Source) It’s extremely weird for a CEO to refuse to answer the most basic of questions about their business model. Unless, of course, that CEO already knew there was no good answers to be given and was being evasive in an attempt to buy some time while they try to sort out a revenue model. In other words, the asset price of his company has risen far beyond what incomes can sustain. The day after recording this podcast with Paul Kiker, Sam Altman tipped his hand further by – I am not making this up – requesting that US taxpayers guarantee the gargantuan loans he needs in order to continue his money-losing project: Sam Altman over at OpenAI wants the US government to provide and guarantee loans for its expansion.Up to a trillion.No, I’m not joking. pic.twitter.com/i4XRjpPPQn On top of that, we’ve also got the CEO of Nvidia now warning that China may ‘win’ the AI race (whatever that means). JUST IN – Nvidia founder Jensen Huang says, "China is going to win the AI race." — Financial Times The pattern is worryingly the same as we saw right before the internet bubble burst in 2000. I see a pattern…Altman and Jenson smell the end of bubble (financing drying up) and are going to ask Daddy for taxpayer money citing national security issues. https://t.co/d8l30BRFSj pic.twitter.com/ASHRJZkcMu And this is the same behavior observed before the infamous South Sea Bubble of the 1700’s blew up. My favorite pitch for South Sea shares? “The company is being formed for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” (Source) That, at least, was direct and honest. I’m getting the same vibes today from Sam Altman. Meanwhile, the actual economy, the one based on real products being made, transported and sold to real people, is shredding at an alarming rate. Freightwaves CEO: "Well, we should be worried. The goods economy, certain portions of the goods economy are collapsing right now. So, year over year trucking volumes, this is really predominance of freight that moves across the United States, is down 17%". "But when you look at… pic.twitter.com/DuCIgJNjWS This is why, when the AI bubble bursts, the damage will be so severe. There’s no solid support beneath it. The real economy is suffering with job layoffs for October the highest since 2003: Layoffs in October were the highest since 2003: pic.twitter.com/QnQ33KFyGZ And that’s with $2+ trillion of government deficit spending, the Fed cutting rates, and financial conditions being extremely easy as M2 grows. How much longer can this all continue? Nobody knows. Which is why having a risk-managed portfolio and a strategic plan are more important than ever.

Companies are simultaneously announcing record AI investments and widespread layoffs, often for the same organizations. While AI is cited as a driver for these cuts, many initiatives show no return on investment. Layoffs, especially large ones, can undermine innovation and employee morale, potentially hindering the very AI adoption they aim to facilitate.

Title: The best PC hardware and software of 2025/2026

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. When historians look back at the PC industry in 2025, they’ll probably remember a time of intense turmoil. Between wildly unpredictable tariffs, geopolitical strife, the AI boom, hardware shortages caused by the AI boom (and tariffs), and hundreds of thousands of industry layoffs, it’s been an eventful – and stressful – year for the PC. Nonetheless, great things happened. We’ve seen the launch of entire new graphics card generations from Nvidia and AMD. The laptops of today are the laptops of tomorrow we’ve always dreamed of. Handheld gaming is exploding in popularity, leaving Microsoft scrambling to make Windows a viable alternative to Valve’s SteamOS on those devices. Security is evolving daily to protect a new breed of AI-powered attacks. Today is a day to celebrate the best of times. This is the Best PC Hardware and Software of 2025, as chosen by PCWorld’s editors. The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition) is the most impressive Windows laptop we tested this year, and I’ll tell you exactly why. It combines a stunning 14-inch 2880×1800 OLED display with HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate, beastly specs (including an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and Intel Arc 140V graphics), and a battery that can last up to 23 hours. It’s speedy enough to handle work tasks and binge-watching your favorite show on Netflix and, at under three pounds, it won’t break your back. The 2-in-1 design is nice too, especially if you move around a lot. You can flip it into tablet mode or set it up like a little tent. This versatility is cool when you’re working with limited space like in an airplane seat, for example. The keyboard and trackpad also feel great, and the Yoga Pen sticks right to the top so it’s always handy when you’re ready to create your next masterpiece… or just doodle for fun! -Ashley Biancuzzo Nvidia bet the fate of the GeForce RTX 50-series on DLSS 4’s incredible multi-frame gen feature. As magical as the feature can be, it left most of the RTX 50 lineup feeling flat at best, or as uninspiring sidegrades at best. Not the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. Unlike most of the 50-series lineup, the 5070 Ti includes a sizeable performance uplift, while costing less – versus the 4070 Ti, you get 25 percent faster performance for $50 less. Better yet, the 5070 Ti’s prowess makes it the perfect vehicle for DLSS 4’s multi-frame gen – the card delivers killer 1440p and solid 4K performance as-is, but flipping on MFG takes visual smoothness and frame pacing to utterly sublime levels. You’re going to want to pair this beast with a 240Hz monitor if you can manage it. In a weak and price-engorged generation for graphics cards, only the RTX 5070 Ti and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 series stand out as particularly appealing. The amazing power of DLSS 4 earns Nvidia this well-deserved nod. If you’re dismissing MFG as “fake frames,” you’re missing out. –Brad Chacos The battery life on the HP OmniBook 5 14 is utter insanity. We’re talking over 25 hours in our testing–you can thank the super-efficient Snapdragon X Plus processor for that one. The 14-inch 1920×1200 OLED touchscreen also looks great because of its wide color gamut and high contrast ratio. While it’ll breeze through most day-to-day tasks, it isn’t a gaming rig or a 3D workstation, so you may want to mind how you use it. That said, the main draw here is the ridiculous battery life and an OLED display that truly pops… all for under $900! This is one stunner of a laptop. -Ashley Biancuzzo This year, the monitor that stood out as the best overall – i.e., the monitor most likely to satisfy the versatile needs of the majority of users – was the Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED. Our high regard began with its big, sharp, colorful 4K QD-OLED panel. It grew with the 120Hz refresh rate and support for Adaptive Sync, making it a suitable option for work as well as entertainment, even gaming. With two video inputs (HDMI 2.1 and USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4 support), 90 watts of Power Delivery for connecting to either Windows or Mac laptops, and two USB-C downstream ports supporting 15 watts of USB Power Delivery and 5Gbps of data, it’s up for productivity. The monitor goes on to sweeten the pot with five speakers – wait, what? — for 25 total watts and support for spatial audio. Finally, it seals the deal with a price that undercuts the competition — $850 MSRP, but currently hovering around $700 on Amazon. – Katherine Stevenson Staying sane while dealing with online security is much easier with a password manager. A good password manager, that is—one that quickly creates and fills in strong passwords, stores passkeys, immediately alerts you to compromised or weak passwords, and lets you securely share credentials with others. Dashlane gets the highest possible marks from us not just for its dependability, but its regular updates, too. In particular, the service now supports full passwordless login, which lets you sign in to your Dashlane account without a password. It’s also one of the first to implement secure import/export of passkeys and passwords (aka CXP). This puts it on the leading edge of credential security—other password managers are still working on their rollout. Combined with standard features like passkey support and dark web monitoring, plus surprising extras like VPN access and real-time phishing protection, Dashlane provides a lot of broad protection for your logins. Other password managers may be cheaper, but not as complete. -Alaina Yee You might expect our pick for best SSD to use the latest-gen PCIe 5.0 interface, which can be 100 percent faster than the previous generation. But while the prospect of such blazing-fast transfer speeds is certainly tantalizing, for most everyday computing activities, including gaming, PCIe 4.0 performs comparably to PCIe 5.0 — and for a lot less money! This is why our pick for best SSD is the WD Black SN7100 SSD, a PCIe 4.0 drive whose overall benchmark performance bested those of its peers, even if only by small margins. The upshot is that this drive is fast, and it features a reassuring five-year warranty. Better still, at $74 for 1TB, it’s half the cost of the best PCIe 5.0 drive. Need we say more? – Katherine Stevenson Adam Patrick Murray / Foundry It’s been a slow year for CPUs. Perhaps in reaction to 2024’s performance issues and regressions, both Intel and AMD have been quiet on the desktop front. Instead, focus has been on laptop CPUs. The lone bright spot for desktop enthusiasts? AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X3D. We saw it coming. Last year, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivered stupendous performance in both gaming and content creation. A flagship version would be even beastlier—and the 9950X3D proved that assumption right. Against the Intel Core 9 285K, the 9950X3D showed gaming performance lifts ranging from 25 to 48 percent (!) and a content creation performance boost of about 10 percent on average. And that’s at stock settings. Turn on PBO and you get another bump in performance. The only disappointing thing about the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is that it takes the title with no real competition. But that doesn’t make it a bad chip. On its own merits—and no matter what kind of PC user you are—it’s a win. -Alaina Yee I expected 2025 to be a breakout year for Thunderbolt 5 docking stations, and I wasn’t disappointed. Many docks I received, however, were priced at the high end of the spectrum. Plugable’s TBT-UDT3 was a notable exception, a moderately-priced laptop docking station I could recommend to those who needed a current-generation Thunderbolt 4 dock or who were looking to invest in next-gen Thunderbolt 5 hardware. Why did I weigh price so heavily? Two reasons: first, the omnipresent tariff concerns, and second, because Intel has reserved (again!) Thunderbolt 5 as a discrete add-on component, making it the domain of high-end, premium laptops, and not the mainstream. Eventually, that will change. But Plugable gives you tomorrow’s hardware at today’s prices. Plugable’s docking station offers the choice of three displays (or two plus an external SSD), Thunderbolt Share, and a general overall stability that unfortunately isn’t that commonplace. I think it’s the best overall docking station I tested, even though others had standout features that I ranked highly. –Mark Hachman Data breaches keep piling up. So too attacks via phishing links and malware. AI may be helping people with dinner recipes and email writing, but it has also sped up the discovery of vulnerabilities—and exploits of them. Even with good online browsing habits, the most careful person can still fall prey to common tricks. You need a safety net. That’s why we love Norton 360 Deluxe. You could stitch together your own equivalent suite yourself, but this antivirus app pulls together and simplifies a very broad range of features for users. In addition to blocking malware and shady websites, Norton 360 Deluxe also offers dark web monitoring, a VPN, parental controls, a password manager, and 50GB of cloud storage for automated backups of critical documents. The subscription even includes general PC utilities like file cleanup, too. This highly comprehensive level of defense is rare—especially given how little Norton charges. You’ll be hard-pressed to find rivals that cost as little or provide as many features. -Alaina Yee Willis Lai / IDG If you want a solid, affordable handheld gaming PC…just get Valve’s Steam Deck. It’s nearly four years old now, but with a starting price of $400 and a “sweet spot” OLED upgrade at $550, it’s still the best option out there for most gamers (especially if you pair the Steam Deck with a GeForce Now subscription, an utterly transformative duo). SteamOS, smoother and better integrated than Windows 11, is a big part of that. If you want a little more gaming power or a bigger screen, the Legion Go S comes with a SteamOS option that doesn’t require any tweaking…but maybe wait for a sale. –Michael Crider For those who want a lot more oomph and options, and don’t mind paying for it, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 is our pick. This beast of a handheld includes the larger screen and Switch-style breakaway controllers of the original design, plus an OLED upgrade and screaming Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor. It runs Windows 11, but Bazzite is a Steam-powered option (and probably official SteamOS, later). Just be prepared to pay for it: this thing starts at $1350 USD. –Michael Crider Not only did the Alienware 16X Aurora impress us with its raw performance, but its high refresh rate display also makes everything look positively delicious. This laptop is equipped to keep up with the latest titles thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and RTX 5070 GPU. You can jump straight into the latest triple-A games without problem, with all the eye candy cranked, and they’ll play amazing. The 16-inch 2560×1600 IPS screen is crisp and big, and the 240Hz refresh rate makes every frame feel as smooth as silk. -Ashley Biancuzzo You might be surprised how much of your personal data is being collected and sold online. Data brokers and people search sites are hoovering up your data at an alarming rate and it’s nearly impossible to keep a lid on it yourself. So the best solution is to let a personal data removal service handle the arduous task of removing this data for you. And none are doing it better than Incogni. The service is dead simple to use, and the set-it-and-forget-it automation begins to work in a flash. After only the first day of using it, Incogni had already sent out hundreds of removal requests on my behalf, saving me months’ worth of effort. Plus, the service regularly follows up with every site to ensure my data doesn’t ever reappear. The addition of Custom removals means there is practically no site that Incogni won’t attempt to wipe your data from either. It can be a bit expensive, but if you’re concerned about your personal data being shared online, the piece of mind Incogni offers is unparalleled. –Sam Singleton For a gaming monitor to even warrant consideration, it needs to be fast and it needs to have a damn good picture. Those are just table stakes, which the MSI MPG 272URX delivers handily. Not content with the standard 1440p resolution, the 272URX goes full 4K for maximum clarity, and its 240Hz refresh rate renders even fast-paced games with buttery smoothness. Adaptive sync support is a given. But lest you think the 272URX’s talents begin and end with gaming, consider this: generous connectivity, including four video inputs, Power Delivery, and a KVM switch; a full complement of image-quality adjustments via a user-friendly on-screen menu; and HDR support. In sum, it’s an all-around winner. – Katherine Stevenson When it comes to Chromebooks, the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 is damned near flawless. It’s got an Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, so it’s zippy when running everyday tasks, and the 14-inch 1080p touchscreen display looks sharp whether you’re cranking on daily workflows or zoning out to YouTube. It’ll also last around 13 hours on a single charge. You’ll get through a full workday, no problem – and with how great the keyboard feels, you won’t have any complaints while doing so. -Ashley Biancuzzo I am so glad I picked eMeet’s Piko+ 4K for our best webcam of 2025: the only flaw that I could find with this cute little 4K webcam is that it lacked a traditional webcam mount. Imagine my surprise when I double-checked my review and our shopping listings, only to discover that eMeet now ships a “traditional” version of this webcam, too! I absolutely loved the clarity that this dual-lens 4K webcam offered, especially in low light. This webcam’s visual capabilities were simply excellent (the mic is merely average, but that’s okay) and the $90 price splits the difference between our $40 budget webcams and the $150-$250 you’d pay for an ultrapremium offering. I wasn’t expecting much from this webcam, but I was blown away by what it offers. –Mark Hachman It’s never easy to select the best VPN overall. There are so many factors to consider such as privacy, ease of use, server network size, unblocking capabilities, and speed. The reasons people have for using a VPN varies widely and that all needs to be taken into account. Will the VPN be used to get around country blocks for streaming, staying anonymous online, torrenting, or something else—the list goes on and on. Many VPNs excel at a few of these functions, but rarely manage to shine across the board. That is, except NordVPN. It’s one of the only services that consistently ranks at the top, or close to it, of each category. That’s why it’s my pick for this year’s best VPN. Not only does it continue to be the fastest VPN I’ve ever tested, but it has a huge server network, a vast array of security extras, and its no-logs policy is backed by plenty of independent audits. It also never fails to unblock streaming services and fully supports P2P. No other current service exemplifies all of the elements of a great VPN like NordVPN, full stop. –Sam Singleton Each time I review Surfshark I’m amazed at the new and interesting features it adds to the service while maintaining such an inexpensive subscription price. At this point, I find myself asking, what doesn’t Surfshark have? Not only do you get the VPN with an outstanding server network and lightning-fast speeds, but you also have access to a whole slew of top-notch privacy and security extras such as multi-hop, antivirus protection, rotating IP, ad- and tracker-blocking, and more. The best part is that all of these great features and tools can be had for less than the price of a cup of coffee every month with Surfshark’s long-term plans. Even shady off-brand VPNs that market themselves as “cheap” barely offer subscriptions for this price—and none of them have the feature set or verified privacy record of Surfshark. It’s by far the best value VPN for those on a budget—and one of the best VPNs overall. –Sam Singleton For truly portable storage that can be carried with ease and used without the need for any additional cables or adapters, look no further than the Teamgroup X2 Max USB stick. This USB 3.2 Gen2 drive uses NVMe internals to deliver sustained transfers of approximately 1.1GBps. Sure, you can find portable drives that are even faster than that – USB 3.2×2 or USB4, for example. But they won’t feature this lil’ one’s unique flexibility in the form of dual connectors. With both USB-A and USB-C connectors, one on each end, you are assured of being able to plug into any device as-is. Now that’s convenience! – Katherine Stevenson This year, things got interesting in the backup software space. Our long-time favorite backup program was knocked from its perch by EaseUS Todo Backup 2025, which made impressive strides to achieve what our reviewer dubbed “the most efficient workflow I’ve seen.” He also described the interface as “a joy.” Wow. These are the kind of superlatives that make the tedious chore of backing up data much more welcoming. Of course, EaseUS Todo Backup 2025 provides all the necessary functionality you need for complete confidence: whole drive and partition imaging, file and folder backup, sync, disaster recovery including a WinPE recover disk, and more. We also love that EaseUS bucks the trend by offering a perpetual licence ($59.99, or $79.99 for lifetime upgrades) in addition to a yearly subscription ($39.99). Although, to take advantage of EaseUS’s optional cloud storage at a respectable $20 per year for 1TB, you will need to opt for the subscription tier. – Katherine Stevenson It makes a lot of sense to use an online backup service. In the context of the trusty 3-2-1 rule for backups, an online backup suffices as one of the two distinct types of media that’s suggested, as well as checks the box that a backup be kept in a remote location. What’s really great about iDrive, our pick for best online backup service, is that it offers even more than that, such as a client for local backups and basic imaging and disaster recovery, which is pretty rare among online services. The Personal tier, which starts at $69.65 per year, has support for multiple devices and includes 5TB of online storage. With its comprehensive feature set and user-friendliness, iDrive is tough to beat. – Katherine Stevenson Most USB-C hubs are dongles: you get a long rectangular slab of plastic or aluminum about the length of a utility knife, with a number of ports attached. OWC’s Travel Dock looks a bit more like a docking station without the size of a docking station. It’s only 3.2 inches on a side, and ports sprout from all three sides of this 5-in-1 hub: USB-A, Ethernet, USB-C power input, HDMI, and an SD card reader. Even the cord tucks away. For about $35 ($30 as I write this) you get the most important four ports you’ll need, all in a compact little square that still fits inside a pouch, purse, or pack. Or…perhaps a stocking? –Mark Hachman Brad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

Title: NVIDIA Shares Dropped 7% This Week: 3 Catalysts For the Fall

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St Shares of NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) dropped 7.1% this week, sinking sharply after hitting a high of $211.34 on Monday morning. Yet, even with the losses, NVIDIA shares had quickly plummeted into correction territory midday Friday. Shares sank to a low of $178.91 before rebounding to close the day at $188.15, a slight gain from Thursday’s close. So, the big question facing NVIDIA investors is whether last week’s losses were the result of ‘market noise’ or were a signal of something larger and more troubling. Let’s dive into 3 catalysts that led to this week’s sell-off. The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 3% last week. Tech stocks in particular were under pressure with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) down 4.2% NVIDIA may have fallen 7.1%, but other semiconductor stocks also fell. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) fell 5.5% while AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) plunged 8.8%. The biggest news among this group of companies at the forefront of producing AI accelerators was AMD’s earnings. Overall, the earnings were a positive piece of news for the industry. AMD forecast outlook of $9.6 billion next quarter, far ahead of Wall Street estimates of about $9.2 billion. Looking further out, AMD projects ‘tens of billions’ in revenue from their data center business from 2027. If you’re an ‘AI bull’ who believes the cycle is far from slowing down, AMD’s earnings generally supported that idea. If you’re looking for reasons the broader market took a nose dive this week, it appeared to be a broader ‘risk-off.’ Most days, technology stocks fell, more defensive industries like Financials, Healthcare, and Consumer Staples rose. Macroeconomic headlines like consumer confidence plummeting amidst the continuing government shutdown also rattled markets. Another key reason technology stocks fell this week was OpenAI ‘spooking’ the market. Earlier in the week, comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman were widely shared across both social media and within money management circles. In the video (embedded in the X post below), you can see Altman get very defensive about a very reasonable question about the company’s ability to finance aggressive spending plans from venture capitalist Brad Gerstner. Apparently, if you ask @sama how his $13 billion money-losing for profit not-for-profit can support $1.4 TRILLION of spend commitments, he gets very defensive and starts to attack non-existent short sellers.I cannot wait for @OpenAI to be a public company. pic.twitter.com/DTPVJJf86x Another key OpenAI storyline was the Wall Street Journal reporting the company was seeking a government backstop on its data center investments. The comments were made by CFO Sarah Friar in an interview with the paper, and OpenAI tried walking them back as ‘poor wording.’ Yet the damage was done. Investors are quickly reversing course and viewing OpenAI as less of a catalyst in the AI space and more of a risk. The company has been on a barnstorming PR tour for more than a month, announcing major deal after major deal and the longer the PR tour goes, the more ‘bubble talk’ grows. There were other headlines this week that captured the media’s attention, such as Jensen Huang stating ‘China is going to win the AI race’ (another statement that has been walked back). But beyond all the noise, the bottom line for NVIDIA investors is that the actual earnings news was very positive last week. Earlier, we detailed how AMD’s guidance for next quarter was very positive and the company also forecast massive scale into 2027. Another bright spot was optics companies. Lumentum, Fabrinet, and Coherent all forecast extremely strong sales. That’s an important indicator for other AI infrastructure companies, as a surge in optics is just one more datapoint in a major acceleration in data center builds. Overall, NVIDIA saw a big decline this week, but the actual news flow around the company was fairly positive this week, thanks to earnings. Their losses are mostly attributable to investors selling off risk this week and comments from OpenAI leading to added selling pressure on AI stocks.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, but it faces significant constraints in power availability and physical space for data centers. While there are abundant graphics processing units (GPUs) available from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the real bottleneck lies in securing affordable, reliable energy to power them and the infrastructure to house them efficiently. This creates opportunities for companies that specialize in converting low-cost power into high-utilization compute resources for AI workloads. Three stocks stand out for their ability to address these issues: Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), IREN (NASDAQ:IREN), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR). By focusing on efficient data centers, vertical integration, and leased infrastructure, these firms position themselves as key enablers in the AI ecosystem, potentially driving growth as demand for compute surges. Nebius Group leads as a comprehensive AI utility provider, emphasizing pre-sold capacity that generates revenue before construction even starts. This approach minimizes risks and ensures steady cash flow, as its recent five-year, $17 billion deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) underscores, as it locks in multi-year contracts. The company’s data centers operate about 20% more power-efficiently than standard cloud facilities, reducing operational costs where energy can account for over 40% of expenses. This efficiency allows Nebius to undercut competitors like Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or even Microsoft’s Azure while preserving higher margins. What sets Nebius apart is its software integration, offering tools like ClickHouse for data management and MLOps pipelines alongside compute resources. This creates a sticky platform where developers face high switching costs once deployed. The result is a synergistic model: affordable energy, optimized hardware, and embedded software tools reinforce one another, blending energy-like stability with software growth potential. As AI demands escalate, Nebius’s full-stack strategy could capture a larger share of the market by delivering reliable, scalable compute that keeps facilities running at peak capacity. IREN excels by controlling the entire chain from power generation to AI compute delivery, making it one of the most integrated players in the space. With renewable energy costs averaging around $0.035 cents per kilowatt-hour — among North America’s lowest — IREN owns the land, substations, and cooling systems needed for rapid expansion. This ownership enables quick deployment of GPU clusters, with thousands already operational and plans for tens of thousands more in Canada and Texas. The company’s edge comes from eliminating intermediary costs, achieving gross margins over 70% on GPU compute rentals. Management targets 60,000 GPUs by 2026, potentially generating $2.5 billion in cloud revenue as utilization ramps up. Microsoft clearly sees the benefit of farming out the operations and just agreed to a massive $10 billion deal with IREN to provide it with high-performance GPU cloud computing. By owning the power and infrastructure outright, IREN avoids splitting profits with vendors, turning cheap energy into a direct competitive advantage. In an era where space and power limit AI growth, IREN’s model accelerates the conversion of underutilized resources into fully operational compute, helping bridge the gap between abundant GPUs and insufficient energized capacity. Cipher Mining functions as a strategic landlord in the AI buildout, providing powered space to major tenants through long-term leases. Its Barber Lake campus, built for high-density operations and gigawatt-scale expansion, has secured a multi-billion-dollar, decade-long agreement with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), ensuring stable revenue and low counterparty risk. It also just signed another major pact with Amazon to support AI workloads over a 15-year lease agreement, valued at around $5.5 billion. This fixed-rent model offers predictability, though it caps upside from fluctuating GPU prices. Unlike Nebius or IREN, Cipher focuses on the physical layer — land, power, and facilities — without owning the compute hardware. Growth relies on capital raises to develop new sites, resembling an industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) with consistent cash flows. In a market tight on capacity, this positions Cipher well, but it may shift to a more defensive stance as supply increases. Still, by renting out ready-to-use space, Cipher directly tackles AI’s space constraints, enabling hyperscalers to deploy GPUs without the delays of building from scratch.

Title: The modernization mandate: Inside Dell and AMD’s new playbook

UPDATED 13:05 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 by Victoria Gayton The modernization mandate is clear: Enterprise IT can no longer wait. Disruptive workloads and brittle legacy systems are forcing companies to act fast, with many now searching for tools that can support a next-generation AI architecture and redefine the data center. The nearly 20-year alliance between Dell Technologies Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has become a key architectural answer to this shift. Once foundational, the partnership now centers on next-generation AI architecture and private cloud strategy — areas where modernization is no longer optional. The stakes are binary, according to Juan Martinez (pictured), senior director of OEM/ODM enterprise and HPC at AMD. TheCUBE Research’s Rob Strechay talks about the Dell and AMD partnership during the “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “Our customers, regardless of the industry … are facing two potential outcomes,” Martinez told theCUBE. “One outcome is [to] be a disruptor in their industry, which will be great for them, or be disrupted by someone else.” Dell and AMD’s shared focus on efficiency and cost resonates with enterprise buyers. Their integrated approach offers a stable alternative to unpredictable public cloud expenses and tackles core pain points, according to Rob Strechay, principal analyst at theCUBE. “I think that one of the things that’s really interesting is … that not only helps from a density perspective, power and cooling, but also licensing costs when you’re looking at software that are licensed that way,” Strechay said during the recent “5 Steps to a Smarter Private Cloud” event. “We see it from the … organizations we talk to on a daily basis.” This feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s ongoing exploration into enterprise modernization and next-generation infrastructure ecosystems. (* Disclosure below.) While AI’s growing influence drives enterprise modernization, Dell and AMD’s real-world impact is already visible in the budget. Their joint solutions are delivering measurable cost relief to IT teams today. Dell’s broader approach to silicon optionality — offering customers a choice between AMD, Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. — allows organizations to match the right performance and price-per-watt profile to each unique workload, according to theCUBE’s Dave Vellante. AMD’s Juan Martinez talks with theCUBE about the AMD-Dell partnership. The joint engineering between Dell PowerEdge and AMD’s EPYC processor line is designed to tackle two major pressures: rising AI compute demands and the need to extend the value of existing infrastructure, thereby enabling the next-generation AI architecture, according to Martinez. The strategy is especially effective in virtualized environments, where maximizing server output is key to reducing overall infrastructure sprawl. “When we look into what we are offering between Dell PowerEdge and our AMD EPYC portfolio, basically we are getting that customers are able to run a larger number of virtual machines per server versus what they used to do in the past,” Martinez told theCUBE. “They are able to get up to 192 cores of performance, high memory bandwidth, and on top of that, we are able to bring a comprehensive path for migration.” This emphasis on efficiency isn’t just theory. Dell and AMD currently hold two world records for VMware performance per socket, highlighting their ability to drive greater density, smarter power management and stronger cost efficiency, according to Martinez. Early customer results back it up: Some have reduced hardware usage by as much as 90%, unlocking the budgetary freedom to focus more on innovation. “AMD EPYC is basically putting all the higher core count, the high memory bandwidth, and that is putting all the comprehensive path to manage all the transition in a way that is making sense from a technical standpoint and AMD standpoint,” Martinez said. “We’re working with Dell very actively to have co-engineering tools that help them to have a comprehensive path to maximize their private clouds and the solutions that they’re running in those private clouds.” As AI workloads become more varied and distributed, system designers are shifting away from monolithic architectures toward balanced, co-engineered infrastructure to support next-generation AI architecture. Dell and AMD’s collaborative approach to building PowerEdge systems with AMD’s Turin family tailors configurations to support AI deployments of all sizes — not just the largest hyperscale use cases, according to David Schmidt, senior director of PowerEdge product management at Dell, and Derek Dicker, corporate vice president, enterprise and HPC business groups at AMD. Dell’s Alyson Langon and Alison Briers talk with theCUBE about the Dell and AMD partnership. “When we sat down and first started discussing Turin with AMD, we recognized that there’s different sizes for different parts of customer journeys, what they need to deploy in their data center,” Schmidt told theCUBE. ”We looked at how AMD was laying out Turin, the Turin stack from top to bottom, and we really challenged each other on what we needed to provide. We were bringing system design ideas to the table of serving customers that need eight cores, 16 cores. It’s not all about the highest core counts possible; it’s about providing the right range.” As hardware density and core counts increase, the pressure on power and cooling infrastructure becomes a key design constraint. This demand is driving a shift back to on-premises control, with customers seeking to avoid high variable costs and gain predictable total cost of ownership, according to Alyson Langon, director of product marketing at Dell, and Alison Biers, global marketing senior director for server, networking and vertical industries at Dell. “[Customers] need predictable [total cost of ownership] so that they can have better budget control,” Briers told theCUBE. “They also want to avoid vendor lock-in with a modular, open infrastructure that can provide that ease of portability, as well as flexibility, and they really want to keep control of their data. They need to keep that data local and secure for stronger compliance and security … they need visibility to the future costs, and they want to … have that across their organization, whether it comes from departments within their organizations or from IT.” Together, Dell and AMD are proving that modernization isn’t just about new technology — it’s about giving enterprises the architectural freedom to innovate at their own pace, according to Strechay.

Title: Southern California’s Main Street economy rattled by inflation, ICE raids and tariffs
URL: https://www.ocregister.com/2025/11/09/southern-californias-main-street-economy-rattled-by-inflation-ice-raids-and-tariffs/

Evidence of economic pain is rippling across Southern California, hitting businesses big and small. Until last month, Simon Yoon ran a popular sushi restaurant tucked away in a Diamond Bar strip center where commuters often stopped to pick up a bite to eat while waiting out the rush hour congestion at the nearby 57 and 60 freeway interchange. Yoon shuttered his restaurant, Fusion 2 Any 1, because he could no longer make ends meet due to a wave of policy decisions to remake the economy by President Donald Trump, who’s just under a year in office now. Yoon said he could no longer afford the $14,000 monthly rent and rising expenses caused by tariffs that tripled the price of everything from a box of chopsticks and a bag of garlic to plastic knives, forks and avocados. “I couldn’t raise my prices to the consumers,” said Yoon, who didn’t want to push away his regulars. “I cut lots of labor.” Also see: Economy shows ‘resilience’ despite ‘thorny issues,’ CSUF economists say He also blamed the drop-off in customers on raids and tactics used in recent weeks by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Diamond Bar, which created a climate of fear in the community. “It’s hurting a lot of business,” Yoon said. “Catching criminals is great, but not everyone is a criminal. There are a lot of hard-working people that are having their families broken up. That’s sad to see.” The 48-year-old Yoon voted for Trump a year ago but now regrets it. “I’m hoping for the best, but nobody comes out to eat,” he said. Yoon isn’t the only business owner barely making ends meet these days. Businesses across Southern California have shed thousands of workers amid a slowing economy, many citing similar reasons to Yoon’s — stretching from Anaheim to Ontario and Pasadena. On Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003. California saw 158,734 people laid off from Jan. 1-Oct. 31, up 16% over last year’s 136,661 — the second-largest employment cuts nationwide, according to the outplacement firm. Cuts in federal funding — fueled by the longest-running federal government shutdown, now at 40 days — also are having their effects. Tariff wars with foreign nations over imports have rattled local businesses, as some are struggling with inflation and labor issues. Cal State University Fullerton economists Anil Puri and Mira Farka and other economists with UCLA Anderson and Beacon Economics recently delivered cautionary forecasts on the state of the economy. Underscoring the concerns, the CSUF economists said that inflation is expected to likely continue to “edge higher into the first quarter of next year,” though they do not expect it to get out of hand, anticipating a peak of around 3.5%.” They added that inflation has “yet to crest,” and “the labor market has yet to find its floor — though neither is expected to inflict as much pain as once feared.” The current annual inflation rate for the U.S. was 3% for the year period ending in September. New inflation statistics published by the regional Consumer Price Indexes for September show an 3.5% inflation rate for Los Angeles and Orange counties. That’s the biggest cost-of-living bump in 16 months. The economists said they wouldn’t be surprised if the remainder of the year is marked by “a few more bumps, with payrolls weakening further as firms await clarity on trade deals, the government shutdown and overall consumer demand.” Layoffs in the region have picked up from a year ago, according to the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal agency that keeps track of jobs data. The BLS paused updates during the government’s shutdown that began Oct. 1. In August, the unemployment rate in Orange County stood at 4.6%, down from a revised 4.8% in July 2025, but above the year-ago estimate of 4.5%. Similar unemployment trends were reported in Los Angeles County (6.3% in August), Riverside County (6.1%) and San Bernardino County (6.1%). Puri and Farka said people should brace for sticker shock when the government reopens, revising figures on job losses and “alarming” hiring conditions. In the past month, Anaheim theme park Disneyland laid off 100 salaried employees as Orange County’s largest employer recalibrates its business ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season. Amazon also is cutting 760 jobs in Southern California — 333 in Irvine — beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence, and Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties laid off 81 people as it shutters Melody Health, its primary care practice, due to federal budget cuts. Other layoffs in October: Some companies even feel the time is ripe to sell. In August, Las Vegas-based Silver State HVAC, Refrigeration & Plumbing acquired The Whitman Co. in Anaheim. “We wanted to avoid a fire sale,” said Linda Whitman, manager of the business and married to owner Fred Whitman, who pointed to the rising cost of doing business in California and plans to retire while the going was good. She said profit margins were shrinking due to the rising prices of commercial-grade heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems since the pandemic when supplies tightened, plus challenges emerging in the past year with tariffs. “We sold primarily for retirement purposes, but it also was driven by what you’ve heard a million times. It’s getting impossible to run a business in California,” Whitman said. “It’s hard to sustain that when costs for workers’ compensation and liability insurance are going up 25% year-over-year, in addition to labor costs and everything else. “One of our big customers is a chain restaurant, and they have been struggling, and that of course affects us,” said Whitman, whose company has avoided layoffs by cutting back hours during certain times of the year. “If we weren’t going to be retiring, it would have been for all the other reasons that we might sell. Our sales have been increasing, but our profitability has not.” In Ontario, local shopkeepers are also worried about the economy. In May 2024, Javier Barajas and his wife, Tania Mangas, took over the Tortas Ahogadas Chapala restaurant in downtown Ontario along G Street. It’s located in a strip center across the street from the popular El Pescador Mexican restaurant along Euclid Avenue — which was packed on Tuesday with a lunchtime crowd of city probation officers and office workers. “People are scared,” said Barajas of the ICE raids. Also see: Inland Empire ICE detainees include gardeners, students, fathers Recent ICE operations in Ontario have dampened dining out and shopping. Business owners interviewed cited high-profile incidents like a landscaper being detained inside a surgical center in July, and a shooting during a vehicle stop in October. Other incidents include the taking into custody of at least three people at a Stater Bros. Markets along Holt Boulevard and arrests of gardeners. Tariffs have not treated Barajas very well, as the price for meats added to Mexican dishes have doubled. On Tuesday, there were a handful of customers eating at the restaurant — which he says was busier before the raids began in the community this past summer. For instance, he said, a chuck roll — a large boneless cut of beef from the shoulder of the cow — shot to $7.50 from $3.80 a pound last year, while a pound of ranchera meat — a higher premium type of beef cut, most commonly used in Mexican dishes like carne asada — jumped to $10.50 from $7 a pound. He says beef prices are up because tariffs have led to higher overhead costs for feed, fuel and labor that have contributed to higher prices consumers see at the grocery store and in their bills at restaurants — like at his. “It’s super hard to make money. I spend all of my money on the restaurant,” said Barajas, who has posted a “help wanted” sign on his restaurant’s front door to fill a cook opening. At the JROD Insurance Agency just south of El Pescador, owner Jesse Rodriguez said that his business is barely getting by. “We used to get walk-in business every time the Route 66 car show was held in Ontario. I didn’t get one customer this time,” said Rodriguez of the 12th annual Route 66 Cruisin’ Reunion that roared into downtown Ontario on Sept. 19. “There’s a slowdown everywhere here in town.” Andres Torres, co-owner of Mission Furniture along Euclid, said that he saw furniture sales climb in the early days of the pandemic when everyone was locked down in their homes and shopping online. Sales have since tapered off, and profits have narrowed in line with a slowing economy he saw before Trump’s election. But another slowdown has emerged with Trump administration-imposed tariffs on Vietnam and China, causing furniture prices to edge up 5-10%, Torres said. “It’s tough, but I’m looking to the future to get ahead of the curve,” said Torres of development projects for housing and more potential shoppers coming in Ontario’s downtown area. “Our intention is to survive this, but the ICE raids don’t help.” Diamond Bar’s Yoon might be temporarily down, but he’s come up with a survival plan for his business. He recently took an offer from a business colleague to open his restaurant in a section of the Gangnam Korean BBQ along Golden Springs Drive, across the street from the Diamond Bar Golf Course. If Yoon can turn his sushi-take out spot profitable, he may end up owning the new restaurant within Gangnam, and begin paying rent to its owner. For now, however, he’s content with managing the bar and restaurant in half the space of his old one a mile away. “I don’t want to leave at the bottom because I did so much for the community,” he said. “I want to go on for a few more years.”

Get ready for a four-day trading week—if you trade bonds. With several key economic reports expected to be delayed by the government shutdown, investors will this week focus largely on corporate earnings reports. And some will get a short break: Bond markets, banks and government offices will close Tuesday for the Veterans Day holiday, though stock markets will remain open. Earnings from Walt Disney, CoreWeave, Sony, Cisco, and Applied Materials highlight this week’s corporate calendar. The small business optimism survey for October comes as market watchers are paying attention to how economic pressures are impacting small firms. The monthly federal budget report from the Treasury Department is expected to show how much revenue is coming from tariffs. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. Earnings from artificial intelligence data center firm CoreWeave on Monday will likely keep investors' focus on the technology that has helped drive markets higher over the past few years. After going public earlier this year, CoreWeave shares have more than doubled. Deals with chipmaker Nvidia and social media giant Meta are driving optimism in the firm's business. Nuclear power provider Oklo's report on Tuesday is expected to show growth tied to the electricity needs for AI data centers. Network infrastructure provider Cisco's report on Wednesday comes after it nearly doubled its AI sales target in the prior quarter. On Thursday, Applied Materials is due to report as the chipmaking equipment supplier faces restrictions on its sales to China. Walt Disney’s report on Thursday follows the company’s recent launch of its ESPN sports app and plans to purchase the NFL network. Other noteworthy earnings this week include stablecoin provider Circle Internet Group, FanDuel-parent Flutter Entertainment, satellite launch firm Rocket Lab, and sneaker maker On Holding. But there's more on tap than earnings, and that includes Tuesday, when chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is set to hold an analyst day at which CEO Lisa Su is expected to offer more details on the company’s artificial intelligence roadmap.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale. Also Read | Nvidia's $100 billion deal with OpenAI: An AI monopoly in the making? It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia. Also Read | Artificial intelligence’s next home: your eyes Labour rebalanceIn the recent quarter, Amazon reported a $1.8 billion pre-tax charge for severance related to planned job cuts, reflecting one of its largest corporate restructurings in years. The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027.

The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

In physical retail, Amazon is scaling back its direct grocery experiment. The company said it was closing all 14 Amazon Fresh stores in the UK, signalling a retreat from a model that failed to gain traction. The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets. It is also redirecting grocery efforts toward logistics, emphasizing same-day perishables delivery through Amazon.com. That service now reaches 1,000 US cities and is expected to double coverage by the end of 2025. Physical store revenue has remained steady at about $5.6 billion per quarter. As it experiments and expands its business, Amazon is also regularly facing regulatory and legal hurdles. It settled a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint over Prime subscriptions with a $2.5 billion charge, which includes $1 billion in penalties and $1.5 billion in refunds. A separate antitrust lawsuit from the FTC and 18 states remains pending, with a trial expected in 2027. All these challenges will test the sustainability of Amazon’s business bets. www.howindialives.com is a database and search engine for public data To sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude.
