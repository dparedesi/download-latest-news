By Blizzard Entertainment 23 hr 44 min ago The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. There are a variety of currencies used at the fairgrounds to purchase armor, armor and weapon appearances, pets, mounts, toys, and more. Here’s what you should make sure you have on hand to spend on all the goodies. During the Anniversary, players will be able to earn anywhere from 1 to 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens per activity over the course of the event each week. Quests and activities can be completed on any character in your Warband and will count toward the weekly amount of (Warband Transferable) Tokens your Warband can earn each week. Activity completions are tracked Warband-wide so there’s no need to run the event with multiple characters every week (unless you want to spread the fun among your characters.) Players who collect 100 Tokens over the course of the event will unlock the ability to earn additional Tokens from 20th Anniversary activities. For those who are looking forward to buying all of the Tier 2 sets, take heart. After the first set purchase at 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll earn the achievement Upgraded Apparel and the second set purchase will lower to a cost of 40 tokens. Purchasing a second set will earn the achievement Classy Dresser which lowers the cost of additional sets to 20 tokens. These sets can be purchased from armor vendor Traeya in the central pavilion. Here are the various activities you can undertake to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens along with Timewarped Badges and Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys: After players collect their first 100 tokens, their Warband will unlock ungated tokens which will drop from the following activities: Now that you know what activities to undertake to earn currency to spend, we’ve rounded up what items you’ll be able to purchase from the various vendors you’ll find at the 20th Anniversary activity grounds. Get Your Tier 2 Armor Appearances From Traeya On the large wooden pavillion in the center of the grounds on Yllana’s right-hand side, you’ll find Traeya who can sell you Tier 2 Armor appearances for Bronze Celebration Tokens. The first set you purchase costs 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens, the second set is discounted to 40 Tokens, and any additional sets purchased are discounted to 20 Tokens each.

The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. There are a variety of currencies used at the fairgrounds to purchase armor, armor and weapon appearances, pets, mounts, toys, and more. Here’s what you should make sure you have on hand to spend on all the goodies. During the Anniversary, players will be able to earn anywhere from 1 to 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens per activity over the course of the event each week. Quests and activities can be completed on any character in your Warband and will count toward the weekly amount of (Warband Transferable) Tokens your Warband can earn each week. Activity completions are tracked Warband-wide so there’s no need to run the event with multiple characters every week (unless you want to spread the fun among your characters.) Players who collect 100 Tokens over the course of the event will unlock the ability to earn additional Tokens from 20th Anniversary activities. For those who are looking forward to buying all of the Tier 2 sets, take heart. After the first set purchase at 60 Bronze Celebration Tokens you’ll earn the achievement Upgraded Apparel and the second set purchase will lower to a cost of 40 tokens. Purchasing a second set will earn the achievement Classy Dresser which lowers the cost of additional sets to 20 tokens. These sets can be purchased from armor vendor Traeya in the central pavilion. Here are the various activities you can undertake to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens along with Timewarped Badges and Timewarped Relic Coffer Keys: After players collect their first 100 tokens, their Warband will unlock ungated tokens which will drop from the following activities: Now that you know what activities to undertake to earn currency to spend, we’ve rounded up what items you’ll be able to purchase from the various vendors you’ll find at the 20th Anniversary activity grounds. Get Your Tier 2 Armor Appearances From Traeya On the large wooden pavillion in the center of the grounds on Yllana’s right-hand side, you’ll find Traeya who can sell you Tier 2 Armor appearances for Bronze Celebration Tokens.

Title: The China Stocks Sell-Off: What The Price Charts Show Now

Hong Kong, Macau It’s a classic case of “too much, too fast,” and it unfolds on a more or less regular basis in the investment world. Despite their MBAs and statistics PhDs, money managers get caught up in the craze of buying and then they have to keep up with their peers to make sure they don’t underperform and then the buying gets even nuttier. The sell-off this week in China stocks fits the pattern: last week Beijing authorities announced a stimulus plan that included the most loved factor anywhere: cuts in interest rates. China-related and China-curious stocks took off higher for days and now reason and adjusted algorithms kick in again. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF: iShares China Large-Cap ETF daily price chart, 10 10 24. This New York Stock Exchange-listed fund contains the top 50 big caps among China-based securities that can be found on the Hong Kong exchange. The Blackrock ETF gives investors a chance to diversify in the sector rather than take chances with just a single stock or two. The fund holds, for example, Alibaba Group Holding, Meituan, TenCent Holdings, China Construction Bank and JD.Com Class A. The price-earnings ratio for the ETF is 14.30, significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 which has a Shiller p/e of 37.22. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF pays a 2.18% 12-month trailing dividend yield. Alibaba Group Holding. Alibaba Group Holding daily price chart, 10 10 24. This is the internet retail company founded by Jack Ma in 1999 with headquarters in Hangzhou. Market capitalization is $265 billion. The stock hits the high end of the value range for the fund’s holdings with a p/e of 28. Alibaba pays a .90% dividend. The daily price chart above shows that it’s actually held on a little better than the iShares China Large-Cap ETF. The stock is now bouncing a bit after the earlier-in-the week sell-off. Las Vegas Sands. Las Vegas Sands daily price chart, 10 10 24. The Sin City casino/resort company has significant properties in Macau and because of that, the stock’s been trading as if it’s a China stock. This is apparent if you simply compare the Las Vegas Sands chart to the Alibaba or the China ETF charts. Trump supporter Miriam Adelson, wife of the late CEO Sheldon Adelson, holds 56% of the stock float. Wynn Resorts. Wynn Resorts daily price chart, 10 10 24. This is another of the U. S.-based casino/resort companies holding large operations in Macau and so, the price charts show how much it trades like Alibaba and the other big Hong Kong securities. WYNN has a market cap of $11.62 billion. You can see the pattern on the daily price chart above: by late September, buyers anticipating an economic stimulus package began taking a liking to the stock and when the actual interest rates-plus announcement arrived, WYNN hit nearly $108. The sell-off took it back down to $100 and it’s been bouncing since then. Full disclosure: when I was News Director of KLUC-FM in Las Vegas, I interviewed Steve Wynn and met with Elaine Wynn. Steve’s no longer involved with the company but Elaine still holds more WYNN shares than anyone else, last I heard. I counted the cards at the Golden Nugget, which they owned then, and lost money doing so. No artificial intelligence was used in the writing of this piece.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification. Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of a city skyline, with many buildings owned by the real estate arm of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is an infrastructure investment firm specializing in digital infrastructure assets. One of the company's key focuses is data centers, which are essential for the AI sector. These data centers support the storage and processing needs of AI workloads, which require vast computational power. Communications firm Verizon recently signed an agreement with Florida-based communications infrastructure operator Vertical Bridge, which is majorly owned by DBRG, for it to exclusively operate and manage 6,339 wireless communications towers across the US for the telecom company under a $3.3 billion deal. The deal is structured as a prepaid lease with $2.8 billion paid upfront in cash and also includes certain commercial benefits, according to a joint statement from both parties. The move will aid the wireless carrier's efforts to expand network footprint while reducing expenses. Overall DBRG ranks 33rd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of DBRG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DBRG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Indigenous groups in Brazil: We were not consulted on carbon credits
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/indigenous-groups-in-brazil-we-were-not-consulted-on-carbon-credits-3656413
Time Published: 2024-10-10T18:33:17Z
Full Content:
(This Oct. 9 story has been corrected to remove a reference to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) as they are not part of this deal, in paragraph 7) By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA (Reuters) - Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom. At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities. But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them. "It is unacceptable for the government of Para to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter. "Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said. Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in the carbon credit purchase was worrying. "Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods." The governor's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb. The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week. Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Para gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations. Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms. Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.

Title: Are you prepared or panicked for retirement? Your age may hold the key. | The Excerpt

On a special episode (first released on October 9, 2024) of The Excerpt podcast: From Gen Z to the Silent Generation, Americans are approaching building their nest egg in vastly different ways. Boomers feel unprepared, while Gen Xers worry they're behind schedule, and Millennials – who are navigating student loan debt on top of rising housing, child care and education costs – are feeling the squeeze. USA TODAY Personal Finance Reporter Daniel de Visé and Money Reporter Bailey Schulz join The Excerpt to share their findings in this first of four specials exploring how different generations are handling life’s pressure points. Hit play on the player below to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript beneath it. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here Dana Taylor: Hello, and welcome to The Excerpt. I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, October 9th, 2024, and this is a special episode of The Excerpt. From prep to panic, retirement expectations in America have become, well, complicated and differs greatly by generation. While Boomers are anxious about having enough put away to finally get out of the rat race, Gen Z is said to be healthy savers ahead of their time. Can understanding the lens through which we talk about retirement help us plan for and navigate this phase of our lives more successfully? To dive into the issues here, I'm joined now by USA TODAY finance reporters Daniel de Visé and Bailey Schulz, part of a network-wide team exploring how generational divides define our thinking on and approach to various cultural facets of life. Daniel, Bailey, thanks for joining me on The Excerpt. Bailey Schulz: Thank you for having us. Dana Taylor: Bailey, I want to start with you here. Before the Boomers who are currently in the process of retiring en masse, there was the Silent Generation, a generation who largely was able to enjoy retirement on generous pension plans provided by the places they worked for 30, 40, 50 years. Then American companies sort of pulled the plug on offering pension plans. How did this generational change impact how Boomers planned for their retirement? Bailey Schulz: Yeah, so like you said, we saw this shift away from pensions toward 401(k)s in the 1980s. I think that has really affected these trends within the generations and how they are saving for retirement. So there was a recent report from Morningstar that found that that sort of shift has left Baby Boomers and Gen X with just less time to accumulate savings for retirement. Dana Taylor: Bailey, the COVID pandemic happened at a critical time for many workers, but especially Boomers, who were hoping to retire relatively soon and then suddenly many were forced out of the workforce early. Have you found that they've mostly recovered? Bailey Schulz: So there was a recent survey by Goldman Sachs, and they found that as for Boomers, about half feel behind on their savings and half say that part-time work will be important to their retirement income strategy. And so that's what we found in our reporting where I spoke to Baby Boomer who is planning to retire within two years, but she will be taking on work here and there when she can. Same with her husband. And so yeah, I think that is just the approach that we're seeing quite a bit of Baby Boomers take to get themselves through retirement. Dana Taylor: Daniel, a lot of Gen Xers had their retirement plans also scuttled by the pandemic. Many in their forties and fifties were hoping to channel money earned during their peak earning years into retirement savings. How have they been faring? Daniel de Visé: Well, I would say that Generation X has been pummeled by a bunch of different economic crises. I'm a Gen Xer and it's the group that was kind of entering their prime right when the Great Recession hit. So that took an enormous toll in terms of their employment, in terms of them building retirement savings. And a lot of Gen Xers too survived the dot-com bust at the turn of the millennium. For a lot of us, that was when we were first getting into the profession. And then COVID. We haven't seen the stock market just go up, up, up, up like some older people did. And so that's kind of where we're at. I think Gen Xers don't have the same sort of confidence in the economy and in the stock market and in their ability to build savings that maybe older folks did. Dana Taylor: Daniel, are there other unanticipated factors impacting Gen Xers with their retirement plans? Daniel de Visé: Well, I wrote about gray divorce for USA TODAY earlier in the year, and that story went bananas. This is people in their fifties divorcing. What's happening is their kids get out of school and then somebody pulls the trigger on a divorce, and I'm seeing it in my own community and we're seeing it a lot around the country, just older people divorcing. As it happens, two people in our story, they both went through gray divorces, or sort of midlife divorces, and it's particularly ruinous for women, for the spouse who was the wife, basically, because oftentimes traditionally the woman in the partnership is less likely to have earned money consistently during the marriage. And so when the partners divorce, I said this in my article, the woman ends up much worse off financially relative to, the guy doesn't do well either, but the woman does worse. Dana Taylor: Higher socioeconomic status of course plays a big role in how a lot of people across generations plan for retirement. Economically, Boomers had a lot of advantages than other generations, later generations, in terms of interest rates, inflation, housing, the list goes on. Yet some have accused the Boomers of climbing the corporate ladder only to pull it up behind them, preventing younger generation from accessing the same opportunities, including higher paying jobs that would've made retirement planning easier. Daniel, is there any truth to this perception? Daniel de Visé: No, I don't think Boomers pulled up the ladder. Boomers were hippies, a lot of them. I don't think a lot of them were super, super competitive or driven to succeed. I think what happened was home prices have gone just crazy in the last bunch of years, so younger people, especially in the last 10 years, feel crippled in their ability to buy houses. Now, that was something the Boomers were able to do pretty easily. Also, the decline of pensions, which we mentioned earlier in this conversation, that happened during the Boomer Generation. So a lot of Boomers actually do have, I've got a couple of pensions. I'm a Gen Xer. So Boomers actually have it a little easier in terms of it's more likely they have a pension and the younger generations are much less likely to have one. And then again, the Boomers, while they were affected by the Great Recession, it came later in their careers. So researchers have sort of proven that they didn't get hit as hard, the Boomers didn't, by the Great Recession. The younger folks, the Gen Xers and the Millennials, were the ones who were really buffeted by that. Dana Taylor: Some of the challenges we're talking about really come down to dealing with unexpected shifts, the Great Recession, the pandemic, now the worry about AI making many jobs obsolete. Bailey and then Daniel, I'd like you both to talk about how you see resilience playing out generationally. Bailey, I'll start with you. Bailey Schulz: So one thing that jumped out to me was just the trends that we're seeing among Gen Z, the young generation who's just really starting to dip their toes into retirement savings. And what they told me is that they're really learning from previous generations and seeing what they faced with the Great Recession, with the pandemic, and starting to really wanting to lean into savings early to prevent some of those financial hardships. And so as far as where that generation stands, we see one study from BlackRock that cites the Gen Z generations as a group of savers ahead of their time. And so I think that's what we're seeing as a trend with that sort of younger group of savers. Dana Taylor: And Daniel, what are your thoughts here? Daniel de Visé: Well, I think the resilience of the younger generation derives from this hardship I was talking about. Again, the Gen Xers, like myself, we went through the Great Recession, we went earlier through the dot-com bubble, and we've been through COVID. So we and the generations beneath us, the Millennials, I think that makes us more resilient. Again, we don't expect the stock market to go up by exactly 10% every single year. We expect it to go down and sometimes for three, four years in a row. I think that very fact makes us more resilient. I did an article recently about how the youngins, they look into these alternative investments. They're not even necessarily investing in traditional stocks. There are these crypto millionaires. They're investing in individual companies based on what they think is progressive sort of corporate policies. So they have a sort of a outside the box way of thinking that probably the Boomers don't have. And then just the other thing would be, because of COVID, the really young folks are kind of coming of age in this era when you move to Boise, Idaho, or one of these COVID boom towns, you've learned that your career can be mobile. You can pick up and move anywhere around the country. I think there's a real strength to that for the younger people. They're sort of arriving into the prime of their careers knowing that they could kind of live anywhere and have this really adaptable sort of approach to both working and parenting. I feel envious of them because my wife and I are really stuck in this old way of thinking that we're used to commuting and we couldn't just move. So we are here in D.C. But it's amazing to think you could go move to Las Vegas where Bailey is or anywhere and live your life there and work your job. Dana Taylor: We haven't talked a lot about Millennials yet. Daniel, many are worried about them from a retirement perspective that they really aren't prepared. What have you found? Daniel de Visé: Report after report show Millennials suffered just as Gen Xers did through the Great Recession. So they started out way behind, right? And so when you look at these retirement surveys, it shows the Millennials playing catch-up, but they're doing a good job of it. I would say that since the Great Recession, which is now, what, 12 years, they've done a admirable job of saving. Their sort of marginal rate of retirement saving is pretty darn good. They don't get a hundred percent of the credit for this. Companies are much more likely to auto enroll you in a 401(k) now, so you may not even think about it and lo and behold, you're invested in retirement savings with your money in an index fund. As for the Millennials, the other thing is they've benefited from this booming housing market in the last several years. Millennials bought their first homes during this huge run-up in value. So lo and behold, their property's worth half again more than it was when they bought it, and they're thrilled about this. No group I would say maybe has benefited more than Millennials in terms of just getting this lift from the housing market in the last several years. Dana Taylor: Bailey, how is student debt playing a role in how the generations view and plan for retirement? Bailey Schulz: Yeah, I think that is a big one, especially for Millennials and Gen Xers, some of whom are still paying off loans at this point. I've seen surveys find that about half of those generations say that paying down loans is a major financial goal. And even more saying that paying down loans like student loans are affecting their ability to save for retirement. So I spoke to one Gen Xer for the story who wasn't able to pay off her student loans until she was in her forties. And so for people in this generation, a lot of times that is debt that is just lingering and really taking away money that could have been going towards their retirement savings. Dana Taylor: In thinking about how various generations approach and plan for retirement, what surprised you the most? Daniel, let's start with you. Daniel de Visé: I would say that the two women I interviewed who are close to my age and generation, what really surprised me about them both was they divorced not too, too long ago and were really starting from zero. And both of them have recovered amazingly, to the point where I believe they're both now more or less on track to retire with some kind of nest egg. And that just blew me away because imagine your marriage falling apart and you find out there was way less than you thought there was saved up or coming your way in the divorce and you're starting from nothing. And then not too many years later, because these women are both very smart and very hardworking and have worked with financial planners, and lo and behold, they are more or less on track. And that really amazed me and made me really happy because there's a lot of people out there who have to start over again, maybe in the middle of their careers, in the middle of their lives, especially after a gray divorce. And it was just really heartening to see two really happy endings to that what could otherwise have been a really sort of life-altering event, basically. Dana Taylor: And then, Bailey, what surprised you the most? Bailey Schulz: I think for a story like this, there's always a mixed bag of what you see with retirement savings, where some people are really struggling to catch up, some are on top of it. But I was surprised by how optimistic I was by the end, especially for those younger generations where I spoke to 19-year-olds who already have Roth IRAs and are putting in money towards retirement. And that's nothing that me or my Millennial friends did back in the day when we were in college. And so I think we're seeing this younger generation of savers who have these resources and financial education materials available and are taking the time to do their research and invest and plan for the future, which is really heartening to see. I spoke to one who is putting away about a quarter of his pretax income into retirement and hoping to retire before the age of 50. And so you have this younger generation that has really narrowed in on retirement savings and setting up for their future. I think that was exciting to see.

Plus: AI Pioneers And Users Get Nobel Prizes, Nvidia Becomes Second Most Valuable Company, Meta’s Smart Glasses Can Be Used To Dox Strangers, Passkeys Are Replacing Passwords More proof that AI technology should be moving past the hype phase: Two AI pioneers were recognized this week with the Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 1980s, John Hopfield developed an artificial neural network, like what exists in the brain, that uses a method for saving and recognizing patterns, providing computers with the ability to essentially connect conceptual dots, writes Forbes senior contributor Tor Constantino. Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the “godfather of AI,” developed the 1980s “Boltzmann machine,” which could train neural networks to “learn.” In the decades since Hopfield and Hinton first published their research, it’s become the bedrock upon which many technologists and programmers have built AI and machine learning platforms. But their selection for the Nobel Prize shocked many—and not just because their contributions have only a tenuous connection to physics. Hinton, who received the Turing Award in 2019 for his contributions to AI, actually left his job at Google last year so he could speak freely about the potential risks to humanity posed by AI systems. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton told the New York Times after his resignation from the tech giant. In an interview published hours after the prize was announced in the New York Times, Hinton said he hopes it will make people take his predictions about AI’s potential harm more seriously. But fears about the technology—which is largely unregulated in the United States right now—continue to thrive. After California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill last month that would’ve placed strict restrictions on expensive AI platforms, conversation about the right sort of regulation has picked up in many sectors, writes Forbes senior contributor Joe McKendrick. After next month’s election, AI regulation may become a topic for action in legislatures across the country and in Congress. But in the meantime, AI technology is sure to advance. After all, this year’s Nobel Prize for Chemistry went to David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for their use of AI in designing and predicting the complex structures of proteins. Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian’s collaboration platforms, which include Jira and Confluence, to unite teams and projects. As AI becomes more powerful, the enterprise software company is using its observations—both from its customers and its own experience—to bring the technology to its platforms. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about Atlassian’s viewpoint and response to AI demand in enterprises. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang displays products at the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference in March. The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world’s second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Wednesday, Nvidia was worth $3.253 trillion, as its days-long rally slowed slightly. Nvidia’s stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August—in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations—its stock price tumbled because it didn’t project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia’s stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia’s soon-to-come Blackwell processors was “so great,” leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was “insane.” Monday started a new rally, courtesy of Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia’s GPUs were strong. And the stock climbed another 4% on Tuesday. This seems to be proof that AI’s effect on markets is still strong. The selloff in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then—buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news—shows they are still overly eager about the technology’s possibilities. Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. While Meta makes the lion’s share of its money from social networks, it’s no secret that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is angling to be one of the leaders in virtual reality and augmented reality. And while neither has taken off among the public at large just yet, Meta has continued to produce and improve tech tools to make them more accessible. Meta has worked with Ray-Ban on AR glasses since 2021, and officially launched the latest version, known as Orion, at its Meta Connect 2024 event last month. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have a built-in AI model that can generate information on demand, bringing 3D screen projections in front of a wearer’s eyes at any point in time, writes Forbes contributor Gerui Wang. Days after the new Orion glasses launched, a pair of Harvard students went viral with a video showing how an older model of Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses can be engineered to identify random people on the street. The students were able to connect the glasses to a facial recognition search engine, then used AI to connect to online databases for home addresses and Social Security numbers. The students walked around the campus area, identifying people and pulling up information like their home addresses and parents’ names. The students intended the video as a demo to show what LLMs and data scraping can do today, as well as show people databases that may have information about them. getty Passwords have been a necessary evil for computers for decades. They allow for user security, but they’re easily forgotten or stolen. More big tech companies have been moving away from passwords and toward passkeys, which are more secure on-device digital forms of authentication that require no memorization on users’ part, operating with secure logins to a larger service, QR code scans, or facial and fingerprint recognition. Last month, Google announced it was expanding its passkey program, allowing users to save passkeys to Google Password Manager from Windows, masOS, Linux and Android devices. Basically, for most devices on which Chrome might be used, a previously saved passkey can unlock a user’s account without requiring a separate password, writes Forbes senior contributor Davey Winder. Last week, Samsung made a similar announcement, Winder wrote in a separate article, making its 2025 models of its smart TV, refrigerator and appliances all work with passkeys instead of passwords. Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj. Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian’s collaboration tools—which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom—to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies’ tech and AI needs, culture at the 22-year-old, founder-led company, and its growth prospects. This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A portion of this interview was also excerpted in the Forbes CEO newsletter. The complete conversation is available here. What are you seeing in the way of AI demand from enterprises, and what are you doing to meet it? Bharadwaj: AI demand for enterprises has gone through a bit of a crest and a trough over the last year and a half. Atlassian builds a lot of collaboration software—mostly things like project management tools, knowledge management tools like company intranets, wiki or tools like Trello, Jira. We announced over the last year a number of AI-driven offerings in our portfolio. One, Atlassian Intelligence, really helps users in the workflow of project management, of writing content, writing articles or sharing collaborative documents with their teams. We brought a lot of AI features in the middle of that workflow to help summarize, edit your content, figure out how to draw information from multiple sources and answer a question that a new employee might have. We built that into the platform. In addition, we have an AI-centric offering that we call Rovo, which really helps teams build agents which can automate and take the next step and action in a smart and intelligent way in any use case that they might be operating in. I’ve worked at Atlassian for 10 years. When we launched it 18 months ago, it was the most positive reception that we’ve ever received across our products. We have millions of users on an active basis. Enterprises, especially, were battling with the problem of: We have a lot of information and a lot of data across the company, but how do we really make use of this? How do we make this accessible and actionable to all of our employees? The two offerings across Atlassian Intelligence and Rovo helped answer that particular question for our enterprises. You said you’ve seen AI enthusiasm peak and also go down into a trough in the last 18 months. What has brought it down, and where are things right now? Initially when the technology wave broke out, there was a lot of promise around what can AI do. It’s hard to predict timelines. But when people talked about AI, we talked about the full spectrum of what’s possible, so a lot of customers saw the extent to which AI can be deployed. We started talking about AI doing code generation. I heard a lot of questions about: Do you think software developers are no longer going to be required? Are we going to replace all the engineers in a company with AI? Which is honestly not a question anybody can answer, and we should be suspicious if somebody gives a certain answer. But the timeline over which that happens, if it happens, is very long. When we started out with AI, there was a lot of hype around all of that appearing tomorrow. What is definitely possible is augmenting existing people that do certain jobs. There are really a lot of automated AI workflows that can help support people. A lot of enterprises thought about what’s the extreme possible application of AI? Now they’re seeing what are applications that are realistic and possible? I would say what is possible and realistic today and in the short-term is still a phenomenal uplift. At Atlassian, we’re a 12,000 person company, and we’ve deployed our own virtual service agents powered by AI. Over half of the service requests that we needed to have our people answer are now handled by the AI agent. A customer who uses our virtual service agents has managed to reroute roughly 85% of the service requests they used to ask humans to handle to the agent first. So the productivity benefits are quite dramatic in specific use cases and specific arenas. I think enterprises are going through that calibration of saying, Okay, what is immediately actionable and where can I see evidence of this happening right now? You are not only a company that creates these solutions, but you’re also an enterprise yourself. What kind of use of AI systems do you have internally at Atlassian? How did you develop them and how does that inform what you do as a company? It’s one of our company priorities. We think about it in two lenses: What can we do to serve our customers and what can we do to use it ourselves as a public company? We’ve tried a few things. Some things have worked, some things have not worked. Because we are a company that spends a lot on R&D, we have a 6,000-person-strong engineering workforce. We think about what does a software engineer really need help with on a day-to-day basis, and code gen has been particularly helpful for us in speeding up the coding part of what a software engineer does. But nearly 80% of [where] a software engineer or developer spends their time on is not coding. How do we help deploy AI to all of the other surrounding areas such that a software engineer’s life gets better? We’ve built several internal agents, like Rovo, which is an agent framework. We’ve built agents that can help translate user experiences from designers directly into deployable code. We’ve built agents that can help prepare deployment environments that software developers can automatically deploy into CI/CD workflows. Because we are also a software development provider, it helps us in two ways: using it ourselves and also making it available for customers. A second category is around customer support or service requests. This can take the form of external customers calling up service centers or filing tickets, or even internal help desk customers. We are now a 12,000-person-strong company. As new hires come online, they tend to submit requests like, I need a new laptop in this particular geo, or I have this question about payroll. A lot of HR, IT, those sorts of service workflows, that is an area where we’ve seen dramatic productivity benefits. Then there’s this third category around collaboration and knowledge workers, which is largely around the blank page problem: How do you start creating content given a few cues, and then how do you iterate on top of it? I want to change the tone of it. It should sound as though Anu said this; it shouldn’t sound like it’s some kind of corporate comms coming in based on attempts. A lot of that category of use cases around communication, editing, summarizing, drawing content from multiple sources—both content creation and knowledge discovery—has been the third category where AI has been particularly helpful for us. The thing that we’ve discovered [is] the number of SaaS tools, the number of products that enterprises use has been exploding over the last few years. Companies used to consolidate on an ERP platform, but then the era of SaaS began. A typical enterprise now uses 150 plus of these tools. Information gets fragmented everywhere. Braintrust, a year-old startup that monitors AI products and helps them perform more accurately, recently closed a Series A funding round led by a16z partner Martin Casado. $36 million: Size of the round, which brings its value up to about $150 million, according to Forbes calculations 80%+: Factual accuracy of an AI system that has used Braintrust for a few weeks, according to the company ‘A tool for helping everyone else to build AI software’: How founder and CEO Ankur Goyal described Braintrust As economic indicators improve, companies might become more active in M&A. And while this impacts many areas of business, it’s important to remember that it also brings cybersecurity risks. Executives constantly have decisions to make, and few of them are easy. Here are some ways successful billionaires have streamlined their decision-making processes. In a motion to dismiss Elon Musk’s federal lawsuit against OpenAI filed this week, how did the startup behind ChatGPT describe the xAI founder’s case? A. A money grab from the world’s richest person B. The next chapter in a saga of regret for Musk’s early departure C. Another opportunity for Musk to see his name in headlines D.

Title: 400 Billion Reasons To Believe In Brain-Computer Interfaces
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenrao/2024/10/10/400-billion-reasons-to-believe-in-brain-computer-interfaces/

Morgan Stanley’s latest report pegs the BCI market at $400 billion in the US alone. “Brain Computer Interface Primer: The Next Big MedTech Opportunity?” by the bank’s equity analysts provides timely research, signaling to investors that this emerging frontier holds potential to generate substantial returns in future decades. This 37-page report includes a commercial history, industry landscape and deep dives into eight ... [+] major market segments for early and intermediate adoption of BCI through 2045. Note: As of publishing this article, Morgan Stanley’s 37-page report appears unlinked to a dedicated url, but the PDF has been circulating the commercial corridors of neurotech networks. This article is not the report. I’ll update this article with a dedicated link if I find one; If you are unable to access the file, just reach out. In addition to a brief summary of BCI’s origins and commercial history, the report covers key topics related to medical device outlook and ends with some speculation about the more distant future of this technology. But in a word, it’s about the TAM. Investors and commercial leaders should understand the rationale behind the Total Attainable Market before they choose to believe it or not. The assumptions and fine print driving the analysis are the GPS for navigating BCI investment today more than any singular estimate. Here’s what you need to know: An important caveat: Topline estimates only captures “potential revenue from a single implant procedure, ignoring a potential replacement cycle and likely recurring revenues from software.” Curiously, while they cross-reference their BCI estimates against other implanted neurotech markets like “spinal cord stimulation ($2bn annual run rate), sacral neuromodulation ($1bn annual run rate), and hypoglossal nerve stimulation ($800mn annual run rate),” they leave out deep brain stimulation from their comparisons. "Cost components of DBS surgery. Cost of DBS device, surgery, total cost of surgery, and total cost ... [+] of treatment." Sidebar: I suspect this was not an oversight, but rather an attempt to avoid undermining their own bullish outlook by analyzing an implanted brain device that has failed to cross $2b in run rate; as Schalk et al wrote earlier this year, “30 years after the introduction of DBS, only less than 3% of patients with Parkinson disease receive a DBS implant.” For sake of understanding this close proxy market however, I dug up recent average US DBS costs from Bishay et al’s 2024 Review. In that paper, the chart to the left is followed by another chart that reveals how DBS costs vary by indication, from Parkinson’s to Essential Tremor or Dystonia. This variability underscores that no medical device is a monolith, and hints at the complexity of neurotechnology pricing and reimbursement strategy. BCI costs will prove highly heterogeneous, between incomparable device designs, surgical approaches, clinical protocols, intended functionality, and much more. Morgan Stanley’s report reflects this across various market segment analyses, but the authors keep the math simple with a low tier and high tier pricepoint. Let’s dive in. Authors segment BCI into broad categories of product and market, and defining and sizing immediate and follow-on markets for each. There are some limitations inherent to any market research of this scope which we’ll touch on at the end. While the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will need to determine appropriate coverage (reimbursement), they offer some ballpark estimates for sake of calculation: The cross sections between “Enable/Prevent” and “Early/Intermediate,” makes the analysis a little byzantine, but the math really comes down to which people will have skin in the game. Morgan Stanley's estimates for immediate BCI applications across 8 clinical indications Eight major market segments each feature an estimated population analysis that includes sizing rationale for both early-stage and intermediate-stage applications. A summary of the former suggests a near-term TAM of $80.8 billion (see above). The latter comprises a larger follow-on market opportunity worth up to $320 billion. Some key assumptions and estimates behind the larger, intermediate TAM figures: As a note, the above three areas are fairly well established in the BCI industry, with Synchron, Neuralink, and Blackrock in active clinical trials, with Precision and Paradromics set to join them following FDA Breakthrough designations last year. While the authors suggest additional indications like ADHD, OCD, anxiety could become BCI markets, they stop short of scoping these opportunities in this analysis. Beyond the above analysis, the report also explores eligible population growth projections, timelines for ramp up, penetration rates, and sales estimates on the early/intermediate rationale defined above for each condition. It’s tidy yet squishy math that doesn’t summarize neatly. After spending a day poring through these numbers and a year studying this market, here are parting thoughts for executives keen on digesting this report to inform their go-to-market strategy in BCI.

Title: Massive Market Meltdown Could Be Looming for Tech Stocks, Warns Former Hedge Fund Manager Hugh Hendry
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/massive-market-meltdown-could-be-looming-for-tech-stocks-warns-former-hedge-fund-manager-hugh-hendry/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T15:59:43Z
Full Content:
On 8 October 2024, famed global macro hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry posted a thought-provoking message on the social media platform X, discussing Bitcoin’s place in the broader financial landscape and warning of potential dangers in traditional financial markets. Hendry’s commentary compared Bitcoin’s market capitalization to that of major tech stocks, highlighting the potential instability in financial markets tied to those assets. Hendry opened by calling Bitcoin “everyone’s phantom, good or bad,” suggesting that while Bitcoin is often a topic of debate, its overall impact on the current financial conversation is relatively small due to its size. He explained that Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, standing at around $1 trillion, is dwarfed by the $42 trillion valuation of tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 (represented by QQQ). He said that this vast discrepancy in size means that Bitcoin doesn’t hold significant sway in current financial market dynamics, but it does possess a unique attraction for potential upside growth due to its smaller relative size. In Hendry’s analogy, he likened Bitcoin’s role in financial markets to Newton’s Cradle, where mass is a crucial factor in determining how forces move through the system. In this case, traditional large-cap tech stocks—such as those in the so-called “Mag-7,” worth about $13 trillion—are the key players in today’s financial landscape. These stocks carry tremendous influence due to their size, making them the focal point of Hendry’s concern. He warned that if these tech stocks falter, the implications could be disastrous for the broader market, leading to margin calls and a cascade of financial disruptions. A major part of Hendry’s caution stemmed from his discussion of “moneyness,” or how close an asset’s value is to the perceived safety of a U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill). In his view, tech stocks, despite their current valuations, are far more volatile than T-bills and could lose significant value in a relatively short time frame. He noted that T-bills are highly stable and are not subject to drastic devaluations—unlike stocks, which have, in the past, lost as much as 83% of their value in an 18-month period. Hendry’s concern focused on the use of these overvalued tech stocks as collateral for loans. He warned that banks may need to reevaluate the true worth of this collateral in the event of a downturn. He believes that if these stocks lose value, the credit market could unravel, causing massive margin calls and liquidity issues throughout the financial system. In response to this risk, Hendry suggested that banks should reduce their exposure to these assets as a protective measure, though this would be challenging due to the market’s dependence on liquidity. Finally, Hendry hinted that he and financial analyst David Levenson are closely monitoring the growth and deceleration of these major assets. He concluded with a sobering thought: if these financial “beasts” cannot grow, they will eventually collapse.

Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has made a substantial purchase of the company's common stock, according to recent filings. Over a two-day period, Saba Capital acquired a total of 109,474 shares with a combined value exceeding $830,000. The transactions, executed on October 8 and 9, 2024, saw Saba Capital purchase shares at prices ranging from $7.56 to $7.6. On the first day, the firm bought 29,482 shares at $7.56 each. The following day, they added another 79,992 shares to their holdings, this time at a slightly higher price of $7.6 per share. These purchases have increased Saba Capital's stake in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust to a total of 55,988,272 shares. The investment firm, known for its active management approach, has demonstrated a growing interest in BIGZ, which focuses on long-term growth and innovation investments. The reported transactions come directly from the latest SEC filings, which provide a glimpse into the investment moves of major shareholders and company executives. These filings are a standard procedure for tracking the buying and selling activities of a company's insiders and significant investors. Saba Capital's recent acquisitions signal a vote of confidence in the future prospects of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. Investors often keep a close eye on such transactions as they may reflect the sentiment of well-informed market participants regarding the company's performance and outlook. The filings were signed by representatives of Saba Capital, including Zachary Gindes, and Boaz Weinstein, indicating the firm's continued commitment to its investment in BIGZ. As the market processes this information, shareholders and potential investors will be watching closely to see how these purchases might influence BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust's market performance in the coming months. Saba Capital's recent purchases of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) shares align with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, BIGZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.6%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024. This high yield supports one of the InvestingPro Tips, which notes that BIGZ "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." The trust's current market capitalization stands at $1.71 billion, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.87, suggesting a potentially undervalued position relative to its earnings. This valuation metric may have factored into Saba Capital's decision to increase its stake. BIGZ has shown positive price performance across various timeframes, with a 19.06% total return over the past year and a 12.5% return year-to-date. The stock is currently trading at 92.36% of its 52-week high, indicating recent strength in its market position. However, investors should be aware of potential challenges. InvestingPro Tips also highlight that BIGZ "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors may explain why the trust trades at a seemingly attractive P/E ratio despite its high dividend yield. For those interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics that could provide further context to Saba Capital's investment strategy in BIGZ.

Title: PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-shipments-fall-in-q3-despite-ai-push-by-microsoft-chipmakers-151502305.html

The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan. According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops. Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end. But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA). In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million. The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud. Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off. According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.” What’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China. There’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen. Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words. But it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs. Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025. “At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Given the quantum of fund inflows into AI-related investment themes, Wall Street appears laser-focused on NVIDIA's Blackwell production ramp-up as a guarantor of sorts for the secular AI tailwind. Today, Morgan Stanley has penned yet another note on NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, this time choosing to divulge some additional information regarding what exactly caused a production bottleneck over the summer. As we've noted in previous posts, NVIDIA had confirmed the rumors of a minor Blackwell design flaw during its recent earnings call, but assured investors that the resulting low-yields issue was rectified by implementing a few minor changes to the photomask - a specific template that is used to create bespoke patterns on semiconductor wafers. NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell ramp appears "quite strong" and issues with initial Blackwell silicon are "totally behind us", says Morgan Stanley, reiterating at 'Overweight' with a $150 price-target: "In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 10, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with its own take on the Blackwell production hiccup, noting that the low-yields issue was only discovered in the post-packaging stage. The ensuing scrapping of the subpar units resulted in a loss of "CoWoS and HBM3e," which were already in short supply and only aggravated NVIDIA's supply problems. Morgan Stanley goes on to note: "But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter." Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley has reiterated that it now sees a "quite strong" Blackwell production ramp-up, "with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks." In a critical insight, Morgan Stanley notes: "Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year." Of course, the Wall Street titan has already stated that it sees NVIDIA shipping up to 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue. Moreover, Morgan Stanley believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes. At the same time, the bank sees Hopper volumes at 1.5 million units in Q4'24, and at around 1 million units in Q1'25.

Amazon Pharmacy is expanding its pharmacy services to 20 more U.S. cities by 2025, offering fast, free delivery of prescription medications. Amazon’s new pharmacies will be embedded within its Same-Day Delivery sites, enabling swift medication delivery. The service offers a digital-first experience, 24/7 access to pharmacists, and various ways to save on prescriptions. By 2025, nearly 45% of U.S. customers are expected to be eligible for same-day delivery, allowing medications to arrive within hours of being ordered. Leveraging its vast logistics network, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN aims to provide a rapid, efficient pharmacy service that directly delivers medications to customers’ doors. Dr. Vin Gupta, Chief Medical Officer of Amazon Pharmacy, emphasized the importance of rapid access to prescriptions. “There’s often a crucial window after diagnosis when starting medication is most critical,” he said. Amazon’s pharmacy expansion also aims to address the growing issue of “pharmacy deserts,” where many communities are over 10 miles away from the nearest pharmacy. Traditional mail-order prescriptions often take up to 10 days to arrive, leaving many underserved. Amazon’s rapid delivery and pharmacist availability close the care gap, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare services. John Love, VP of Amazon Pharmacy, highlighted Amazon’s efforts to streamline medication delivery and offer clear pricing, automatic coupons, and discounts for Prime members. Innovations such as RxPass, a $5-a-month subscription for 60 common medications, and savings of up to 80% on generics demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to making healthcare more accessible and affordable. Since its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy has integrated technology to modernize pharmacy operations while maintaining clinical oversight. Hannah McClellan, VP of Operations, Product, and Technology at Amazon Pharmacy, added that feedback from customers and physicians has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the importance of fast medication delivery. Price Action: At last check Thursday, AMZN stock was up 0.99% at $187 during the premarket session. Read Next: Photo by Koshiro K via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzinga.com.

We asked thousands of PCMag readers to share the stores they buy electronics from and rate them on a wide range of qualitative measures, including things like prices, product availability, payment options, shipping, and even the quality of the onsite product descriptions and images. The result was a definitive, data-backed ranking of the best tech retailers in the US. Now it's time for round two. This year, 34 retailers qualify for inclusion in our results. The following charts break down the ratings for online, brick-and-mortar, and hybrid retailers (ie, companies that run online and physical stores). We also take things a step further this year by comparing different store types, including mobile carriers, tech manufacturers with retail chains, and big box/warehouse stores. In other words, next time you go shopping for anything electronic, these are the outlets you should head to first. For 2024, we introduced a key change to the survey: instead of giving stores a single overall satisfaction score, they now receive separate scores for their online and in-person experiences. We combine these ratings for retailers that meet our survey threshold in both categories and give the score a weight based on the number of responses it received for online versus offline shopping. This methodology helps us get a more accurate picture of the companies that excel at both online and in-person retail. Using the aforementioned scoring system, Micro Center earns the highest combined satisfaction score for both online and physical store experiences, and thereby secures our Readers' Choice Award. Although the company has a limited number of brick-and-mortar locations, customers who visit those stores or shop via microcenter.com are overwhelmingly satisfied. (Note: Click the down, left, and right arrows in our interactive charts to view different elements of our survey results.) However, Micro Center’s victory isn't a landslide. Costco comes in a close second in both overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend, which is definitely worth keeping in mind if you prefer to shop in person. There might not be a Micro Center store near where you live, but there's more likely a Costco within driving distance. Last year's best overall tech retailer, B&H Photo Video, earns a top spot again this year, specifically for its online storefront. Customers rate it higher than any other brand in our survey when it comes to overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, and customer service. B&H also earns a Readers’ Choice Award for its stellar shopping cart and checkout experience, and scores notably high for mobile shopping—even higher than Amazon. Another standout in this category is Apple, which leads among manufacturer-run stores. The company's online storefront, Apple.com, receives top marks for product availability and quality, standing out among competitors like Canon, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Logitech, and Microsoft. Other sub-category wins include Crutchfield for its top-notch customer service, Walmart and Costco for their great membership/club costs, Amazon for its stellar shipping, and Temu for its exceptionally affordable prices. That being said, it's worth noting that certain retailers who made the podium this year also earn abysmal scores in specific categories. Temu, for example, earns high praise for its low prices but also comes in dead last for product quality and second-to-last for shipping speed. The site has also come under fire for ethical reasons in recent years, so keep that in mind before you dive in and start shopping. When it comes to in-store experiences, Micro Center reigns supreme. If you’re fortunate enough to live near one of its 28 locations (with a 29th opening soon in Santa Clara, CA), it's worth a visit the next time you need new tech gear. Customers rate Micro Center exceptionally high in overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, product selection, and customer service. An interesting thing to note here is the stark difference in scores for physical and digital storefronts. For example, Walmart makes both the online and brick-and-mortar list, yet earns much higher scores for its online store. The same goes for Amazon. It is at the absolute bottom of the heap when it comes to in-store retail (it currently has just 22 Amazon Go stores speckled across the country) but near the top of the list for online shopping. Not all retailers operate the same way. Some only sell their own products, while others stock items from a wide range of manufacturers or focus on specific categories like mobile phones. This can make direct comparisons between retailers tricky, so in an effort to simplify things, this section breaks down retailers by the type of stores they operate. Among brands with stores (both online and/or brick-and-mortar) that sell their own products, it's no surprise to see Apple at the top. The company earns industry-leading ratings for overall satisfaction, product quality, product availability, customer service, and likelihood to recommend. The only place Apple falters (as we see in many surveys) is price. Customers love most things about Apple, but not the high cost of its products. A very close third here is Amazon, but this is more of a courtesy inclusion since Amazon’s numbers are based on selling anything and everything, not just its own products. That means the next vendor down—Canon USA—is another great retailer to consider, especially if you’re in the market for a camera or printer. The big three mobile carriers in the US don’t score particularly well—at least not when compared with the other vendors in the lists above. But if you have to pick one to shop at, your best bet is T-Mobile. It has far better scores than AT&T or Verizon in most categories. That said, Verizon does well in some categories—most notably product availability, product quality, shipping cost, and shipping speed. But its overall satisfaction numbers are a half point below what T-Mobile’s stores earn. This year, our Readers' Choice Award for big box retailers goes to a somewhat unexpected vendor: Lowes. Despite the fact that it doesn't specialize in tech gear or electronics, it easily outpaces its competitors in terms of overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend. Interestingly, both Lowes and Home Depot beat their more tech-focused rivals when it comes to product selection, availability, and quality. Best Buy (the most-used big box retailer among our respondents) earns the lowest overall satisfaction score of all—lower than many competitors that don't specialize in technology products. When it comes to stores that require club memberships, Costco is the most beloved among PCMag readers, earning top marks for overall satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, value, and satisfaction with price. The biggest of the three, Sam’s Club, only outscores Costco in a few areas (product selection and shipping speed for online orders), and they tie in many others. BJs only bests the other two when it comes to payment options. Otherwise, Costco thoroughly dominates the field. It sweeps the remaining categories and earns an impressive 9.5 out of 10 for its return policy. The PCMag Readers' Choice survey for Retailers was in the field from August 22 to September 15, 2024.

In today's tech-saturated world, you have more options than ever when it comes to buying the electronics you need. Whether you're shopping for a new smartphone, a graphics card for your PC, or even just a set of batteries for your TV remote, the range of available retailers is vast. You can order online from the comfort of your home, visit a local big box store, or even buy directly from the manufacturer’s website. Each option has its own perks. But with so many choices, how do you decide where to shop? Which retailer offers the best overall experience, whether online or in-person? Last year, we set out to answer those questions with our first-ever Readers' Choice survey for Retailers. We asked thousands of PCMag readers to share the stores they buy electronics from and rate them on a wide range of qualitative measures, including things like prices, product availability, payment options, shipping, and even the quality of the onsite product descriptions and images.

Title: Key DeFi service Uniswap launches its own blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/10/10/key-defi-service-uniswap-launches-its-own-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T13:40:51Z
Full Content:
Uniswap Labs, the corporate entity that builds products to use the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol of the same name, announced on Thursday the launch of a so-called layer 2 blockchain. The new blockchain is called Unichain and, according to the company, will significantly speed up the time it takes to carry out transactions on its decentralized exchange. “Unichain will initially have one-second block times, and will later be optimized to meet 200–250 milliseconds block times. This will feel like a near-instant transaction experience for the user,” said Uniswap Labs in a statement. Layer 2 blockchains, knowns as L2s, have proliferated in the last few years and include services like Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base. They work by compiling transactions and recording them as a batch onto the main Ethereum blockchain, a process that minimizes fees and avoids delays due to congestion. The decision by Uniswap Labs to launch an L2 of its own is significant because Uniswap—an open-source protocol akin to SMTP for email—is the most popular tool for DeFi, which relies on modular, Lego-like tools to carry out trades without a centralized authority. Using the email analogy, Unichain is like Gmail or another client built on the open protocol. In an interview with Fortune, Uniswap Labs COO Mary-Catherine Lader said Unichain will in time make using DeFi less clunky for users and also increase liquidity across the industry. A former banker with BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, Lader predicts DeFi-style tools will increasingly be adopted by the world of traditional finance. According to Lader, Uniswap Labs built Unichain with a mind for the Apple adage that building great software requires great hardware, and the company’s philosophy is based on simultaneously pursuing the crypto ideals of speed, low cost, and decentralization. Unichain itself is built on the L2 technology known as Optimism, which is used by a popular L2 of the same name and by Base, among others. Uniswap was created in 2018 by self-taught programmer Hayden Adams, who has since developed a second and third version of the protocol. In late 2022, Uniswap Labs raised a $165 million Series B funding round that at the time valued it around the same amount. Uniswap created the new L2 blockchain with the help of the DeFi research and development organizations Flashbots and OP Labs. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The company soon opened its play universe called Horizon Worlds, featuring floating personalized avatars. As the rebranding to Meta approaches its third anniversary, none of that stuff has gone mainstream. But the company appears to have found its footing in virtual and augmented reality through a different medium. After achieving surprise early success in the smart glasses market through a partnership with Ray-Ban, Meta is ginning up excitement for the prototype of a much more advanced pair of glasses called Orion, a project nearly a decade in the making. Zuckerberg's reveal of Orion late last month has triggered a level of enthusiasm that's unfamiliar in the metaverse. The triumphant demo, at Meta's annual Connect event, was a relief to many employees and represented an internal shift in sentiment toward Zuckerberg's costly hardware ambitions, according to people close to the company who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press on the matter. At the start of the demo, Zuckerberg pulled the device out of a locked metal briefcase. He showed off the gadget — a pair of black, thick-framed AR glasses — to the live audience before placing it on his face. Orion comes with a wireless puck that allows it to run holographic virtual images on top of what users see in real life. It also relies on a wristband that picks up on a user's neural signals to let them control the device. The demo was seamless. The crowd oohed and aahed. Rave product reviews followed from the few who got to test it. CNBC's Julia Boorstin described a call she had with her producer, saying, "It was like I was FaceTiming with him but he was in my glasses." The Verge's Alex Heath played Zuckerberg in a game of Pong and wrote that he "noticed little to no lag in the game." "The right way to look at Orion is as a time machine," Zuckerberg said at Connect. "These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting." Following the Orion showcase, Meta is preparing to strengthen its relationship with software developers as it works toward building a consumer version of the device, and to pushing its current generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to more consumers for the 2024 holiday shopping season. The company is also looking at ways to bring the technology developed for the Orion wristband to its other consumer devices, notably the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to a person familiar with the matter. For Meta, the uptick in excitement among employees and users comes well after Wall Street jumped back into the stock. After the company lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022 and then slashed about a quarter of its workforce, or 21,000 jobs, Meta's stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, reaching a fresh high this month. Meta proved the resilience of its dominant online advertising business, rebuilding the underlying technology after Apple's iOS privacy change made it harder to target users, and adding generative artificial intelligence tools to make it easier for brands to run campaigns. But proving that it can mimic its digital ad success in a totally different market has been a persistent challenge. Facebook's initial foray into VR came in 2014 with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus. Since then, the company has poured more than $63 billion into what's now called Reality Labs, its AR and VR hardware and software division, and it's recording operating losses in the billions of dollars per quarter. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated just $353 million in revenue, accounting for less than 1% of the company's total sales. Industrywide, global shipments of VR and AR headsets in the period sank roughly 28% from a year earlier to 1.1 million units, according to market researcher IDC. "This is a very long-term bet," Zuckerberg said in July 2023. "At a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it's just outside of the model of I think even most long-term investors." Orion provides a tangible example of the company's strategy and a logical and compelling next step following smart glasses, people familiar with Reality Labs told CNBC. Meta declined to comment. Meta is planning to start courting developers next year, as it tries to get them excited about building apps for Orion so the company can learn what might resonate with consumers, according to people familiar with the company's road map. The push into the developer community would coincide with Meta's expected debut of the fourth generation of its Llama family of AI models. By releasing a more powerful Llama, Meta is hoping that developers would be able to incorporate the software in their future AR apps to help power tasks like recognizing real-world objects and more accurately reacting to voice commands, the people said. Ultimately, Meta is working toward building a consumer version of Orion, something that could happen within two years, they said. That timeline may be overly ambitious considering how long it took to get Orion this far. Facebook began working on the device as far back as 2016 under the leadership of Oculus' then chief scientist, Michael Abrash, according to people familiar with the matter. Abrash is now chief scientist at Reality Labs. In 2018, the project was moved out of research and development and was put on the product path under the guidance of Andrew "Boz" Bosworth, who was Facebook's head of hardware at the time and is now Meta's technology chief. At one point, the company had a version of the device that offered AR visuals but it had to be in extremely controlled settings to work, the people said. For example, visuals didn't work outdoors, they said. Meta has been testing functioning versions of Orion glasses for well over two years, the people said, getting the product to a point where it could finally be unveiled to the broader company and to outsiders. The company finished the prototype in March. Engineers put a lot of work into getting the device to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), about twice the weight of a heavy pair of glasses, and to have a 70-degree field of view, sources said. Zuckerberg, who's been the driving force behind the company's advances in AR and VR, made the ultimate decision to go public with Orion, the people said. Meta is likely years away from being able to deliver a consumer version of Orion and has numerous challenges to overcome to reach mass production. "One could criticize Orion as vaporware," Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a report to clients on Oct. 4, referring to "technology that may not end up in an actual product." Bonner, who recommends buying the stock, said the product demonstrates "Meta's continued commitment to virtual and mixed reality applications." Meta will need to develop a global manufacturing supply chain that can account for some of the rare materials used in the device. One particular hurdle will be figuring out how to get mass quantities of silicon carbide, which is used for the displays in the Orion lenses. Meta recently hired someone from semiconductor contract manufacturing company GlobalFoundries to help develop and oversee the supply chain for Orion and related AR and VR devices, people with knowledge of the matter said. In the meantime, Meta is looking to build on the success of its second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Released in partnership with EssilorLuxottica in September of last year, the product featured a number of upgrades, including better camera quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. The smart glasses went viral on TikTok during the holiday shopping season, and sales exceeded both companies' expectations. More than 730,000 units have been sold in their first three quarters since release, according to IDC. Zuckerberg told investors in July that they were "a bigger hit sooner than expected." Last month, Meta and Luxottica agreed to extend their partnership, with plans to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, people familiar with the matter said. A Luxottica representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Meta is also opening a pop-up shop to showcase the smart glasses and to get them in front of more consumers. The pop-up shop will be at a retail space in Los Angeles. A job post by BDS Connected Solutions says the company is looking for retail staffers in the West Hollywood neighborhood. "We're staffing up for the ultimate Meta pop-up experience in the heart of Los Angeles," BDS says in a post on X. "With lowriders, street vibes, and everything that makes LA iconic, this pop-up is a true celebration of Southern California culture."

Title: Delta Stock Falls as Quarterly Results, Outlook Disappoint

Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) declined in premarket trading after the carrier's third-quarter results and fourth-quarter sales outlook came in below analysts' estimates. The carrier also confirmed costs of around $500 million that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ed Bastian had estimated following the CrowdStrike (CRWD)-caused global IT outage in July that resulted in 7,000 Delta flight cancellations over a five-day period. Delta posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $15.68 billion, below consensus expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Delta also projected fourth-quarter revenue growth of between 2% and 4%, lower than estimates. Fleshing out details of the damage from the IT outage this summer, Delta said it lost out on direct revenue of $380 million, largely from refunds and customer compensation, and incurred additional costs of roughly $170 million. The costs were slightly offset by $50 million in saved fuel expenses from canceling the 7,000 flights over five days. Delta shares, which had risen by more then 25% this year through Wednesday's close, were down 3% less than an hour before the opening bell.

Title: In court, Albertsons CEO warns that merger failure may force cutbacks by company

If the merger with Kroger doesn’t go through, the CEO of Albertsons Cos. Inc. said in court Wednesday that his company might have to consider layoffs and leave certain markets to remain competitive and financially secure in the long term.Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition.Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys. A merger of the two competitors would violate state antitrust laws, the attorney general’s office said.But Sankaran said the two chains see merging as the best way to compete against Walmart, first nationally in grocery sales, as well as such fast-growing food sellers as Amazon and Costco. Walmart and Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart, account for about a quarter of the country’s grocery business, he said.“We can do many things to improve the company, but at some point the ability to compete with the Amazons and Costcos and Walmarts of the world, you just need added scale. We knew we wouldn’t be able to get that by ourselves,” Sankaran said.Albertsons began looking for ways to grow and merging with another company was one of the possibilities. Soon after Albertsons and Kroger announced consolidation plans in October 2022, several United Food and Commercial Workers locals, state and local officials came out in opposition.The Federal Trade Commission has sued to put the merger on hold until it can finish its proceedings aimed at stopping the companies’ plan. A decision in the FTC’s lawsuit is pending.A trial is underway in the lawsuit by Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state, whose complaints against the merger are similar to Colorado’s. In Colorado, Albertsons and Kroger are prime rivals in the grocery industry, according to an analysis presented by the state last week in court. The analysis produced by an expert witness for the state played down the competition posed by Costco, Amazon, Whole Foods and other retailers.But asked who he sees as Albertsons’ biggest threat, Sankaran said Walmart, Amazon and Costco are among his biggest worries. “These competitors are growing so fast and they’re already large. They’re who I worry about in the long run.”Sankaran said data on where customers in Colorado shop shows that for every $1 spent on groceries, Albertsons reaps 14 cents. Kroger takes in 16 cents and Amazon gets about 5 cents. Walmart captures the biggest share: 20 cents on the dollar. The rest of the money goes to a variety of entities, including Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.To try to ensure there will be competition in the market after the merger, Kroger and Albertsons have struck a $2.9 billion deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, which would buy 579 of their stores nationwide. In Colorado, C&S would buy 91 Safeway and Albertsons stores and a dairy plant. Kroger would retain 14 of the stores in the state.Kroger and Albertsons have said C&S, a grocery distributor that now operates just 25 retail grocery stores, has the resources to take over the stores. But Roger Davidson, an industry consultant testifying Wednesday for the state, said he expects that stores bought by C&S will see declining revenue and some will likely close.Davidson said C&S won’t have enough people or a strong enough retail infrastructure to successfully run all the stores it plans to acquire.Jason Slothouber with the attorney general’s office asked Sankaran about the potential impacts on communities and workers if stores in more remote parts of the state close after the merger.“Even if C&S crashes and burns, you have this golden parachute for yourself,” Slothouber said.Sankaran acknowledged that he will receive a total of $43 million in equity and severance if the merger is completed. “I realize it’s a lot of money for a guy who came from India with a suitcase. I don’t take that lightly,” he said.Related Articles Retail | State says Kroger-Albertsons merger may cost Coloradans $500M per year; companies dispute claim Retail | Colorado next up to argue its case against Kroger-Albertsons mega merger Retail | Montbello’s status as a food desert to end next year with $97M project that includes grocery store, housing and more Retail | Kroger and Albertsons make a final pitch for their merger before a judge decides whether to block it Retail | A state’s experience with grocery chain mergers spurs a fight to stop Albertsons’ deal with Kroger But he called Slothhouber’s questions about stores closing and people losing their jobs “hypotheticals” that he couldn’t answer.Kroger and Albertsons have said that stores won’t close, people won’t lose their jobs and wages will increase if the merger goes through.

Vivek Sankaran testified for several hours in Denver District Court during the second week of the trial in the state of Colorado’s lawsuit that seeks to block the consolidation of the two supermarket chains. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office contends that the $24.6 billion merger would harm customers, store employees and suppliers to the chains because it would reduce competition. Kroger, which owns King Soopers and City Markets in Colorado, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway, account for more than 50% of the supermarket sales in Colorado, according to state attorneys.

Title: Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-microsoft-oppenheimer-chooses-100026830.html
Time Published: 2024-10-10T10:00:26Z

The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible. But the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements. In addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path. For Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.” These comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here) Overall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast) Microsoft Corporation Now on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company. Like Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages. Microsoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped. The company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google. AI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users. Building out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast. The company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for. 5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.” Horan follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) While the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Helen of Troy (NASDAQ: HELE), a leading global consumer products company, has reported favorable results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, surpassing market expectations. CEO Noel Geoffroy highlighted the company's strategic initiatives, such as Project Pegasus, which have contributed to its strong performance despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. The company has seen a 9% increase in U.S. distribution and significant international sales growth. However, it reported a consolidated net sales decline of 3.5% for the quarter, attributed primarily to decreased demand in Beauty & Wellness. Adjusted EPS decreased to $1.21, with net income at $17 million. The company remains focused on long-term growth and efficiency improvements, with an emphasis on innovation and marketing investments. In conclusion, Helen of Troy's second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call presented a mixed but overall positive picture, with the company beating expectations and focusing on strategic growth initiatives. While there are challenges ahead, particularly in the Beauty category, the company is taking steps to address these issues and capitalize on its strengths in distribution and product innovation. Helen of Troy's recent financial performance aligns with several key metrics and insights provided by InvestingPro. Despite the reported 3.5% decline in consolidated net sales, the company's financial health appears robust. InvestingPro data shows that Helen of Troy has a market capitalization of $1.67 billion and a P/E ratio of 11.33, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. This aligns with the company's commitment to using free cash flow for capital deployment, including share repurchases, as mentioned in the earnings call. Another relevant InvestingPro Tip indicates that Helen of Troy's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, which is a positive sign for the company's financial stability. This strong liquidity position could provide the flexibility needed to navigate the challenging macroeconomic environment and invest in growth initiatives like Project Pegasus. The company's profitability over the last twelve months, as noted by InvestingPro, is consistent with the reported net income of $17 million for the quarter. However, the InvestingPro data also shows a revenue decline of 3.96% over the last twelve months, which mirrors the company's reported sales decline and cautious outlook for the upcoming quarter. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 8 additional tips for Helen of Troy, providing investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position. These insights can be particularly valuable given the mixed signals in the company's recent earnings report. Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Helen of Troy Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Sabrina McKee, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Sabrina McKee: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Helen of Troy's second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings conference call. The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. I will begin with a brief discussion of forward-looking statements. Ms. Noel Geoffroy, the company's CEO, will comment on business performance and then provide some perspective on current trends. Then, Mr. Brian Grass, the company's CFO, will review the financials in more detail and discuss our outlook. Following this, we will open up the call for Q&A. This conference call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations with respect to future events or financial performance. Generally, the words anticipate, believe, expect, and other similar words are worth identifying forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause anticipated results to differ materially from the actual results. This conference call may also include information that may be considered non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures are not an alternative to GAAP financial information and may be calculated differently than the non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other parties. The company cautions listeners not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or non-GAAP information. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Geoffroy, I would like to inform all interested parties that a copy of today's earnings release and related investment deck has been posted to the company's website at www.helenoftroy.com and can be found by navigating to the Investor Relations section of the site or by scrolling to the bottom of the homepage. The earnings release contains tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP-based measures. I will now turn the conference call over to Ms. Geoffroy. Noel Geoffroy: Thank you, Sabrina. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report second quarter results that were above expectations. During the quarter, we took decisive actions toward our long-term strategic initiatives, including strengthening the core and further shaping our growth portfolio. In addition, despite persistent macro headwinds, we are generating results on our efforts to reset and revitalize our business, which we believe indicates we are on the right path to improve our operating performance. Through our increasingly data-driven approach, we continue to see improvement in our brand fundamentals. Project Pegasus continues to be on track and is generating critical fuel for reinvestment in our brands. This fuel, combined with our sharper brand fundamentals, is leading to stronger marketing with new creative, new more agile media campaigns, better innovation, and better execution. We are also continuing to grow our distribution. Fiscal year-to-date, we meaningfully grew our U.S. weighted distribution by 9% year-over-year, making our brands increasingly available where our shoppers shop. All of these efforts contribute to improved market share performance, with eight of our key categories growing or maintaining share this fiscal year-to-date in our U.S. measured channels. Now to share an update on shaping our portfolio. We have previously shared that we were engaged in an active process to divest the business. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we opted to pause that process as the offers we received are not indicative of the value of the business or its potential. We will continue to consistently evaluate our brands to ensure we position the company for long-term success and growth. Our acquisition strategy remains to look for brands with strong global growth potential, are financially accretive, and meet our Better Together criteria. We will remain disciplined in our approach to both divestitures and acquisitions to ensure we are able to deliver on our commitment to increase shareholder value. Before I turn to the results for the quarter, I will provide an update on the Curlsmith and Tennessee distribution center operational issues. As previously discussed, we resolved the Curlsmith ERP integration issues. In the second quarter, we successfully integrated Curlsmith into our distribution network ahead of plan. With respect to our Tennessee distribution center, I'm pleased to share that we consistently improved our shipping execution and operating efficiency throughout the quarter and have now addressed the root causes of the technology issues we experienced. We are now servicing customers and consumers in line with our expectations and anticipate reaching our productivity goals by the end of the fiscal year with a continued eye on best-in-class service. Now let's turn to performance across our portfolio. Overall, we see our Home & Outdoor performance strengthening, our Wellness performance ahead of our expectations, and our International performance remains a bright spot. Our Beauty performance was below our expectations for the quarter, but we are taking focused actions to improve the fundamentals of the business and its brands. Starting with Home & Outdoor. OXO grew share fiscal year-to-date in core kitchen utensils, a category that we see as largely normalized post-pandemic. The brand achieved strong sell-through at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) following the June expansion into 3,200 stores and over five times increase versus the test with additional distribution coming soon. OXO is also gaining momentum in dry food storage with share growth fiscal year-to-date. OXO also continued strong momentum in coffee. Shortly after the end of the quarter, OXO launched our new portable Rapid Brewer coffee maker, which makes hot coffee or cold brew in five minutes or less. It has already earned positive reviews from Food & Wine and Consumer Reports. As I will discuss in more detail later, International performance, especially in EMEA, is also strong for OXO. Hydro Flask outperformed our expectations and is a key example of brand revitalization across innovation, distribution, and marketing. We still have many areas of opportunity, but are encouraged by our meaningful progress across all key focus areas. The new Travel Bottle was launched in the second quarter and provides consumers with the best of both worlds, the utility of fitting in most car cupholders or backpack pockets, and it is leak-proof. The new bottle comes with your choice of a Hydro Flask flip straw or chest cap along with a convenient carrying strap. Hydro Flask also successfully launched into Costco (NASDAQ:COST), a key retailer for expanded target consumer. The brand also benefited from strong distribution internationally with sales up in all key markets. Hydro Flask also launched a new brand campaign called, We Make It, You Own It. The campaign celebrates the individuality of the Hydro Flask consumer and highlights the broad array of products, configurations, and colors we offer for a wide range of consumer preferences and occasions. The brand also showed great consumer obsession and marketing agility this quarter by being a part of two relevant cultural moments, Brat Summer and the MTV Video Music Awards. Music artist Charli XCX launched her Brat Album in June with an iconic lime green album cover, leading Gen-Z to christen the summer as the Brat Summer, which was typified by Cool Girl style and Lime Green Everything. Hydro Flask quickly created a Brat Summer water bottle that we promoted on our social media account. Our Instagram post achieved Hydro Flask's highest year-to-date engagement rate, drove a double-digit lift in sales around the post, and gained the attention of Charli XCX, leading to a new partnership for her current concert tour and great overall exposure for the brand. Our second cultural moment came in late summer when the VMA's Best New Artist winner walked the red carpet and sat in the front row with a custom Hydro Flask in hand. Social engagement on that post have now eclipsed our Brat Summer post. These are two great examples of moving at the speed of culture, which is critical to driving relevance with our target consumer. Turning to Osprey, the brand is maintaining its leading share in U.S. technical packs even as that category softened. Osprey continues to extend into exciting new adjacencies. A great example that is rooted in consumer obsession is Osprey's new photography accessories line. After years of consumers asking us for photography gear, and extensive research and testing by Osprey, we launched our new photography accessories line in July. The line is built around the PhotoLid, an innovative padded camera case that support active photographers and content creators and designed to replace the removable top lid on most backpacks, while also offering accessible and protective storage for photogear. The new line has received strong consumer engagement and a tremendous response from the industry, earning Gear Junkie's Best in Show award from the Outdoor Market Alliance Show. In Everyday and Lifestyle packs, Osprey is having strong success with its daylight line, which is driven by new color designs, Osprey's high-quality materials and durability, and an affordable price point that caters to consumers in the current economic environment. This line continues to offer extended distribution opportunities for the brand. Now turning to Beauty & Wellness. Our Wellness business performed above our expectations with particular strength in fans and thermometry. As widely noted by the media, illness rates in the U.S. increased through July and much of August, and both Braun and Vicks thermometers saw higher POS. Fiscal year-to-date, while the thermometry category overall has remained relatively flat, Braun and Vicks have outperformed and gained share. They remain the number one and number two brands in the U.S., respectively. We also gained new or expanded distribution on Braun thermometers at CBS, Costco, and Walmart, in addition to Braun blood pressure monitors in Walmart. In Humidification, while the category remains soft, Vicks has maintained its number one share position. As we enter the peak cough, cold, and flu season, our inventory is well-positioned to serve customers and consumers as the season progresses. In water filtration, we are also seeing positive POS for PUR at Walmart, where the brand has been growing its presence. For Beauty, we continue to see softer POS across the brand portfolio and are taking actions to revitalize the brands and lean in where we see meaningful opportunities, leveraging consumer insights and our new brand-building frameworks. We also recently added new leadership with fresh perspective to help set this business up for long-term success. I mentioned the new Drybar our marketing campaign last quarter as an example of where we are evolving our marketing content and targeting with the support of our marketing center of excellence. We began the rollout of that new Drybar Polyglamorous campaign in July. This is a bold and fun repositioning of the brand that focuses on Drybar's more than 80 hairstyling products and complementary tools that allow consumers to dabble, tease, and play. The campaign has been very well received with social media engagement over twice the historic rate. We continue to see market opportunity for our hair products. We are pleased that Curlsmith is gaining market share in the fast-growing Prestige Hair Liquids category fiscal year-to-date. This quarter Curlsmith launched Shake & Shine Refresh Mist, which is crafted to refresh, moisturize, and define curls to extend the result of a wash day. In addition, Curlsmith earned an Allure Best Beauty of 2024 Award for Frizz Control Cleanser and Frizz Control Duo Conditioner. Last quarter, we extended our popular Drybar Liquid Glass product line, and we followed that up this quarter with additions to our thickening line, Drybar Big Brew. Revlon remains the unit share leader in hot air stylers fiscal year-to-date, and we have sold three times more Revlon One-Step Volumizers than the next largest competitive item. This month, we launched a new marketing campaign to appeal to savvy consumers who want salon-quality results without breaking the bank. The value reframe highlights that on average, Revlon retails for a tenth of the price of a Prestige competitor for similar results. We also continue to see strong momentum with the Revlon portfolio at Walmart, where consumers appreciate great care tools at accessible price points. Internationally, our businesses performed well with sales up almost 5% and all key regions contributing to the positive growth. Home & Outdoor outperformed our expectations and grew in all key international markets, driven by expanded distribution and greater collaboration between the brand and sales teams. In the U.K., you'll find a Drybar pop-up not only in Boots Battersea in London, but also onboard the Harrods tour bus as part of an exclusive multi-branded campaign where consumers were treated to a styling. Curlsmith launched in select Sephora and Boots stores in the U.K. and Hydro Flask expanded into GO Outdoors flagship stores. OXO has expanded at John Lewis, Leeds, in the U.K., has a beautiful pop-up in BHV Marais, one of Paris' most famous department stores in the heart of the city, and expanded its retail footprint in Japan. Osprey is well represented in Germany with a large display at Sport Schuster, Munich's leading sporting goods retailer. These are just a few examples of how we are increasing our global footprint. Stepping back, I remain confident that the reset and revitalized building blocks we discussed last quarter will prove to be a solid foundation for the future, but we know that change of this magnitude takes time. We remain committed to our strategic choices, growing our portfolio through consumer obsession, being and winning where our shoppers shop, fully leveraging our scale and assets, and embracing next-level data and analytics in everything we do. We are making significant progress on the road back to sustainable long-term top line growth and you heard evidence of that today. I want to thank our exceptional global associates across Helen of Troy for their dedication and passion for our company and brands. Now I will turn it over to Brian. Brian Grass: Thank you, Noel. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report second quarter results that were slightly above the high end of our expectations for net sales, adjusted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA. As Noel mentioned, we substantially completed the remediation efforts related to the automation system at our Tennessee distribution facility with minimal impact to sales in the quarter. We believe that we are now in a position to achieve targeted efficiency levels by the end of fiscal '25. We also rightsized our cost structure in line with our fiscal '25 net sales expectations, while maintaining our planned incremental growth investment, an increase of approximately 165 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter. While we know we have more work to do to achieve our long-term goals, we believe these results represent solid progress considering the executional challenges we overcame in the quarter. I'll now move on to a more detailed discussion of our second quarter results. Consolidated net sales declined 3.5%, slightly ahead of our expectations as the second quarter sales impact from automation challenges at our Tennessee distribution facility were less than originally expected. The sales decrease was primarily due to a decline in Beauty & Wellness, reflecting lower sales of hair appliances, air purifiers, and humidifiers, primarily driven by softer consumer demand, reduced replenishment from retail customers, and a strong competitive environment in hair appliances and air purification. Home & Outdoor grew almost 1% year-over-year, primarily due to improving trends in OXO and Hydro Flask, partially offset by a slight decline in Osprey. Our International business continues to perform well with sales growth of almost 5%. Consolidated gross profit margin was 45.6%. The 110 basis point decrease was primarily due to a less favorable product and customer mix within Home & Outdoor and unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year. These factors were partially offset by lower commodity and product costs, partly driven by Project Pegasus. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.3% compared to 9.5% in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 9.8%. The decrease was primarily driven by the planned incremental growth investment of 165 basis points I referred to earlier, and an estimated 85 basis point impact from additional costs associated with automation start-up issues in our new distribution facility. Decline also reflects the lower gross profit margin and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower overall personnel expense and the lower commodity and product costs I referred to earlier. On a segment basis, Home & Outdoor adjusted operating margin decreased 270 basis points to 15%, primarily due to unfavorable distribution center expense, a less favorable product and customer mix, and planned incremental growth investment. Adjusted operating margin for Beauty & Wellness decreased 350 basis points to 4.4%, primarily due to planned incremental growth investment, unfavorable inventory obsolescence expense year-over-year, and the impact of unfavorable operating leverage. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 22% compared to 17.9% last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the impact of our Barbados tax legislation enacted during the first quarter of fiscal '25, shifts in the mix of income in our various tax jurisdictions and an increase in tax expense for discrete items. Net income was $17 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS was $1.21 per share, reflecting lower adjusted operating income and an increase in the adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a decrease in interest expense. Free cash flow was $39.7 million, an increase of $11.7 million year-over-year, but slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to higher working capital needs. We ended the second quarter with total debt of $713 million, a sequential decrease of $35 million compared to the first quarter. Our net leverage ratio was 2.34 times compared to 2.37 times at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our Board authorized the repurchase of $500 million of our outstanding stock in keeping with our intention to return capital to shareholders, not otherwise deployed for core business growth or strategic acquisitions. The authorization was approved as part of the Board's regular process of reviewing our capital allocation and existing authorization. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal '25, we are maintaining our expectations for consolidated net sales, adjusted EPS, and adjusted EBITDA, and have updated our expectations for sales by segment, free cash flow, and ending net leverage ratio. We remain cautious as external headwinds of increased promotional activity, softer and more variable retail replenishment, and macro pressure and uncertainty remain. While the Federal Reserve's move to begin lowering interest rates will likely provide relief for some, we believe that the benefit will take some time to cycle through to many consumers. We also expect a year-over-year headwind from a shorter holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. We continue to expect net sales between $1.885 billion and $1.935 billion, which implies a decline of 6% to 3.5%. This includes the unfavorable impact to net sales of approximately $8 million due to the shipping disruption from the automation startup issues at our distribution facility and the Curlsmith ERP integration challenges in the first quarter. In terms of our net sales outlook by segment, we now expect a Home & Outdoor decline of 2.3% to growth of 1.4%, which includes the impact of shipping disruption in our Tennessee distribution facility during the first quarter, and a Beauty & Wellness decline of 9% to 7.5%, which continues to include a year-over-year headwind of approximately 1% related to the expiration of an out-license relationship with respect to one of our Wellness brands. We continue to expect GAAP diluted EPS of $4.69 to $5.45 for the full year and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $7 to $7.50, which implies an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 21.4% to 15.8%. We continue to expect full-year adjusted EBITDA of $287 million to $297 million, which implies margin compression of approximately 150 basis points to 160 basis points year-over-year with approximately 50 basis points coming from the automation start-up issues at our distribution facility. We continue to incrementally invest back into product innovation and marketing for the long-term health of our business and our brands and continue to plan for a year-over-year increase in growth investment spending of roughly 100 basis points. We continue to expect some gross margin compression given our expectation of a more promotional environment and a less favorable sales mix. However, we still expect to expand gross margin year-over-year due to Project Pegasus. Finally, we anticipate lower operating leverage from the decline in revenue, which we expect to be offset by the rightsizing of our cost structure that we began to implement in the second quarter. Our first quarter interest expense outlook included the expectation of 225 basis point reductions for the remainder of fiscal '25, which now largely aligns with the Fed's 50 basis point reduction in September, and we have assumed no further rate reductions for the remainder of fiscal '25. As such, our full-year interest expense expectations remain unchanged. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate range of 27.3% to 29.5% for the full fiscal year and a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate range of 20.7% to 21.3%. We now expect capital and intangible asset expenditures of between $32 million and $37 million for fiscal '25, which includes remaining equipment and technology of $11 million to $12 million associated with our Tennessee distribution facility. We now expect free cash flow in the range of $180 million to $200 million, which implies a free cash flow yield of 12.7% to 14.1% using Monday's closing share price. Our lower free cash flow expectations for fiscal '25 reflect a slower start to the year and revised estimates for working capital and CapEx needs to support the continued improvement in our operating trends and opportunities we see for the remainder of the year. We now expect net leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement to be between 1.9 times and 1.8 times by the end of fiscal '25. In terms of cadence, for the third quarter of fiscal '25, we expect net sales decline in the range of 4.5% to 1% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS decline in the range of 10% to 3% year-over-year. As we look towards fiscal '26, we thought it beneficial to provide an update on our efforts to diversify our production outside of China and mitigate the impact of potential incremental tariffs in the future. With the first step of this strategy, we have reduced our exposure to incremental tariffs to a range of 25% to 30% of consolidated cost of goods sold. We are now launching the second step of our strategy, which targets a further reduction to our exposure by the end of fiscal '26. We plan to share more on this important initiative when we provide our fiscal '26 outlook this coming April. Finally, I'd like to update you on the process to divest one of our businesses. After a thorough and rigorous process that included both strategic and private equity bidders, we have decided to put the process on hold until further notice. We feel the valuation and structure of the offers we received were not reflective of the current health of the brand and future potential of the business. Year-to-date, the business has performed largely in line with expectations. We believe there is potential to further improve its performance. We intend to continue to consistently evaluate our portfolio to ensure our assets position us for long-term success. In closing, I am pleased with the progress we are making to reset and revitalize our business in fiscal '25 and believe this will position us well to improve our core and achieve our long-term objectives. Our Project Pegasus initiatives are on track and are fueling a step-level increase in brand and innovation investment, and we have invested more in data-driven decision making and capabilities to leverage that investment more efficiently. We will continue to use our free cash flow to deploy capital using a balanced approach, which we believe can drive significant accretion, whether we pay down debt, repurchase our shares, or make strategic acquisition. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. Maybe my first question was just -- I wanted to ask about kind of the quarter and the path from here. Maybe just to start, you both outlined a lot of great things that are going on across the portfolio, but when you think about the upside in the quarter, is there a way to parse out how much of that was the category coming in better versus maybe some of the actions in innovation you outlined? And then as we look ahead, what's really embedded from a category perspective? Last quarter, I think it was -- or it seemed you more or less were anticipating what you saw in May was going to hold. Can you maybe share what you -- what's kind of embedded in the outlook today from a category standpoint? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Great to hear from you. So I would say, overall, as we look at kind of the balance of the year and the impact of our performance versus the categories, there's a little bit of both, but I would say, as I highlighted in my remarks, I'm really pleased with some of the performance that we're seeing on some of our brands. We've been hard at work, putting brand-building frameworks in place, really understanding our target consumer, putting the incremental investment behind the brands, you're seeing a lot of new products come out that I touched on today from the Hydro Flask, Travel Bottle, the Rapid Brewer from OXO, Big Brew extensions that are performing well, Curlsmith's new products that are coming out, so really across the portfolio, we've got a lot of new products and they're making an impact. Distribution gains or another, I talked about Hydro Flask performing and doing well in Costco. We continue to be really pleased with the performance of OXO in Walmart. And so I'm pleased that we're seeing the results start to come through from the work we've been doing across all of our portfolio. Category-wise, I would say, it's a mixed bag, we play across a lot of categories. So we've got some categories where we still see a little bit of softness, like a dry food storage, for example, some have flattened out, like kitchen utensils. Thermometers, as I mentioned in my remarks, has flattened out. A little bit of softness still in technical packs. I would say, the outdoor -- kind of the core outdoor category is still a little bit soft, but we're holding share there, our leadership share in technical packs. So if I was going to attribute it to anything, I'd say, our performance is improving. Brian Grass: And I'd just add, Peter, that in terms of assumptions for the remainder of the year, we do attempt to update our category view every quarter, and we did do that, but I would say, it was very similar to the view that we had last quarter. So, no -- I'd say no major change being driven from category assumptions. Peter Grom: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just on the buyback, and I apologize if I missed this, but just any thoughts on how you're thinking about timing? Is this something you're looking to complete in a relatively short timeframe here, or is this more of a longer-term program? Brian Grass: No, I'd say there's no views on it really. This was really just good housekeeping of the Board, refreshing our authorization, because it had -- it was expiring at the end of August. And so it was really a refresh of our authorization and I'm getting it back to the level that we kind of historically set them at and then we'll look to execute those as we see opportunities going forward. So no burning views and really just good housekeeping. Peter Grom: Got it. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Sabrina McKee: Thanks, Peter. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to the implied outlook for the back half of the year. Given the Q2 be -- it would imply that maybe the back half is slightly softer on sales and EPS, so I just want to get a sense of whether -- what's driving that or maybe if it's just embedding more conservatism. Noel Geoffroy: Yes, Rupesh. Good to hear from you. So, look, when we looked at quarter two, we saw less of a revenue impact from the Tennessee Distribution Center than we anticipated as Brian called out in his remarks. And so that helped us in the quarter and then we didn't feel it was enough to flow through from there. That's really the difference. Brian, anything you want to add? Brian Grass: Yes. I would say, we really exceeded our -- the high-end of our expectations by about $4 million and we had planned for approximately $5 million of disruption from the distribution center. So I would say, all in, we kind of felt like it was more of a met expectations in that regard and really not enough for us to consider raising our guidance for the second half. Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just my follow-up question. Just as we look at the Beauty category, clearly, it's gotten more competitive out there, maybe some -- there's also some macro headwinds with the consumer there. What would you say are the key efforts to drive that category back to growth? And how do you guys think about timing, like is this something that could take a few quarters to drive improvements or just any more color there in terms of efforts and potential timing of a turn in the Beauty category? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. I would say, in Beauty, a few things. One, it started for me with really doing the foundational brand-building framework work that we did, including that detailed quantitative category segmentation of consumers. So we really understand who the consumers are, what our segments are and how do we position our portfolio of brands against those different consumer segments. And so that foundation -- we completed kind of at the start of the year and now the brands are using those frameworks and using all of that insights to build their plans and kind of continue to move forward. We did bring in some new leadership in Beauty & Wellness for some fresh perspective. We've had a lot of meetings with some of our key retailers. So we're getting customer and buyer input on what they're seeing, what they're looking for. And I think you're already seeing some of the fruits of all that labor come into the market that I talked about today. Curlsmith, a real bright spot, really pleased with how that's performing growing share, in a growing -- a high growing category, lot of new products that are really hitting the marketing award, getting a lot of positive consumer feedback. On Drybar, the liquids are -- some of the liquid extensions are a bright spot like Big Brew that I commented on, really hitting on that consumer insight of thinning hair, with the power claim of 150% volume producing with Big Brew, so that's standing out. The Revlon Volumizer, we just launched some value reframing, which came directly from that brand-building framework, understanding that there's a group of consumers out there who are value-seeking right now, right? They want that great strong quality performance, but they don't want it to break the bank. So they're looking for a product like our Revlon One-Step. It's still the -- Revlon is the share leader in hot air stylers and that particular item still sells more -- three times more than the next largest competitor. So it's really putting our marketing out there, so the consumer can choose us more often. So those will be the things that we continue to do. We've got some more innovation in the pipeline. I think there's something we're excited about towards the end of the year that will come out from a new product standpoint, but those are going to be the steps, right? It's the marketing, it's the new products, it's positioning our brands in the marketplace with our retail partners effectively. Rupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you for all the color and best of luck. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Rupesh. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Robert Labick: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to kind of follow up on what you were just saying there. You've increased brand investment, but you've also increased investment in data and analytics capabilities. Can you like tell us what are the key learnings from this increased data and analytics so far? And what have you done and what have you changed in your processes or your outlook, investment, et cetera, as a result of the learnings from the data and analytics capabilities you now have? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Bob. That's been a really big focus for me. I really felt that we will be better by using data and analytics to inform everything we do, and so it started with the foundational consumer segmentation and understanding in the brand-building framework so that we're really clear going into our planning who were looking to reach and who is sort of that high-growth prospect consumer segment by brand. And then as we're allocating the incremental media that Project Pegasus helped generate, it's using that insight to go after the right target audience, and then we did a very robust first-time-ever marketing mix model that allows us to understand our return on ad spend across all the brands in our portfolio, but also importantly, every single tactic that we use. So we're able to optimize our spend across the brand portfolio, but also importantly across the tactics. So we can look across upper and lower funnel and really optimize against that return on investment and the reach that we're looking to get. So it's really a completely new way of going to market for Helen of Troy, who we're talking to and then how we're measuring the impact of that spend. Robert Labick: Okay. Great. And then, Brian, I think you touched on the shorter holiday season, I guess, with later Thanksgiving and stuff. Could you give us a sense of how the retail environment is setting up right now versus, I guess, expectations and versus prior years? Brian Grass: Yes. I mean, there is an expectation of a softer environment, which I would say we kind of had for the remainder of the year before we really got to the holiday season. So I would say the expectations are more value-oriented and maybe a little bit softer, but I feel like we had that embedded in our expectations already. Robert Labick: Okay. Great. Thank you. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Bob. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Olivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. You had mentioned that several categories have been normalizing now, for example, OXO. So can you talk about how do you expect that to manifest? Are you advertising more behind them? Is there more shelf space either in brick-and-mortar or more focus online on those categories? And how do we think about that in light of the more challenging macros, particularly as it relates to promotional levels in your key categories and whether retailers are going to be tighter on inventory near term? Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So I would say, when it comes to the normalizing categories, those are really the ones that were impacted by COVID. So if you think about kitchen utensils, we were still kind of continuing to see that category decline as we were coming off of the COVID -- kind of the COVID surge of that particular product line. Now, I would say, it's acting more normally. On a go-forward basis, a category like kitchen utensils and really a lot of OXO gets driven by new home formation, back-to-school meal prep, holiday meal preps, things like that. It becomes more of those normal activities. I will say right now, we're also impacted on OXO by eating in or dining out how consumers choose to kind of spend their money that way. So as consumers are being a little bit more diligent about how they're spending if they choose to eat out a bit less in the home more, that's a positive for a brand like OXO. Thermometer was another one that had a big normalization. Air purifier is a big normalization post-COVID. So I think, those -- a couple of them are still normalizing. I would say, air is still a little bit normalization, hasn't fully occurred yet, similar on dry food storage, that's another one from a category standpoint that's still normalizing. I think in terms of retail inventory, I mean, look, we don't see anything hugely unusual right now from a retail inventory standpoint. The thing that we see is the retailers who are maybe performing a little bit less well in the marketplace are using different techniques to manage their inventory quarter-to-quarter, so we've got a little bit less visibility than maybe we have in the past. They tend to manage it at a total store level versus category-by-category. And so those are things that we see from time to time that impact us that can be a little bit surprising, but that -- otherwise, I don't see a huge inventory issue in the retail marketplace right now. Olivia Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the guide and maybe you can help us understand sort of the building blocks to get from one end of the range to the other now that you are at the halfway point of the year. Likely, you have some fairly reasonable visibility into holidays, recognizing, of course, a shortened holiday period this year versus last year, but just any sort of building blocks around one end to the other? Thanks. Brian Grass: So you're talking about what would change between the high end and the low end of our guidance, Olivia? Olivia Tong: Basically just trying to understand what the parameters are to get to the high end of the outlook versus the lower end of your outlook given that... Brian Grass: Okay. Olivia Tong: Presumably we know what holiday looks like already and a couple of other things. Brian Grass: Okay, that helps. Yes, I would say that the building blocks on the high end of our guidance would be, what we have clear line of sight to, and as we've said before, we've taken a hard look at POS trends and tried to assume that the current trends, not try -- assume that current trends would remain consistent throughout the remainder of the year. I would really say the big thing that would change from there would be POS trends declining. So if POS trends were to decline from where they were, then that would be a factor that would put us more towards the lower end of the range, but that's really it. I would say, we've not leaned forward on opportunities that we didn't have line of sight on with respect to our high end of our outlook, so that's there. In the POS, we've assumed -- current POS trends, if they were slightly lower or lower, that could pull us down closer towards the lower end of the range. But that's really it, because we haven't really made leaning forward assumptions with respect to the incremental building blocks such as distribution gains or new product innovation or even our return on investment from our marketing spend. We feel good about the data we have to support that. And so we think that's a tangible building block. So I think it really have to be a major change in trend or a major change in the macro environment. Noel, do you want to add anything? Noel Geoffroy: No, I think that's right. And as we've said before, the biggest tangible building block in the back half is distribution, followed by, I would say, some incremental innovation and then the marketing spend. Olivia Tong: Got it. Thank you so much. Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Linda Bolton Weiser: Yes. Hi, thank you. So I think originally, if we go back to this original expectations about the cadence of growth or decline or whatever, the original, I guess, idea was that you had gained a lot of distribution in the second half of 2024, and that benefit would carry on into the first half. Is there any way to quantify -- despite all this other noise that occurred from the DC implementation, is there any way to quantify that distribution benefit in the first half of your fiscal? And then is the distribution benefit in the second half kind of going to be bigger or smaller than what you've already had, if you can understand what I'm asking? Thank you. Brian Grass: Yes. Just to answer the second question first, the distribution gains we are getting in the second half of this year should be bigger than the carry-forward gains from the prior year that impacted the first half of this year. So we are -- we have secured incrementally more distribution, I would say, that we'll apply new distribution, that we will apply to fiscal year '25 than we had secured in fiscal year '24. And we haven't really sized it. So I would not be comfortable giving that right now. We haven't really sized it publicly. And so we have talked about the dimensionality of the new distribution that we have for fiscal year '25. But with respect to '24 and its carryover impact on fiscal '25, we haven't really disclosed that. But I will tell you that the fiscal '25 gains are bigger than fiscal '24. Linda Bolton Weiser: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, I was just curious about -- in our store checks, when we checked at the Ulta within Target, it's sort of a limited selection of brands. It's not a huge array like a regular Ulta store, but we did notice that your Drybar and your Curlsmith had very nice shelf space there. So can you talk about that? And is that like a benefit to the whole growth rate? I mean, does it move the needle at all, or just can you talk about sort of that positioning within Ulta in Target? Thanks. Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Linda. I would say, look, physical availability, so having our brands is widely available in front of as many shoppers as possible, is a benefit in my view, so I think the Ulta in Target helps to do that. It brings some of our premium prestige liquids like Curlsmith and Drybar. Even in the limited assortment that's there, as you mentioned, I see this as a positive thing. There's just -- there's a lot of people -- a lot of footfall going through Target, and so having that store within a store there and being part of that assortment is a positive. Whether or not it's a needle mover, I don't know that we break it out in a way to be able to see specifically what's coming from one versus the other, it's all Ulta for us. But I just subjectively would say, I think it's a great thing for our brands and it allows a brand like Curlsmith to be in front of shoppers at Target within that store within store. So all positive from my perspective. And similarly, the Sephora within Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), it's a similar idea. Linda Bolton Weiser: Okay. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question. Susan Anderson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if maybe you can give some thoughts just kind of going into the holiday season how you're expecting consumer spending? Do you expect them to -- do you expect it to be similar to what we saw all year on spend on discretionary items? And then also maybe if you could just talk about the promotional cadence year-over-year that you're expecting and just how you're planning for the season? Thanks. Noel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks, Susan. I would say, in general, on holidays, we talked about there's one last week. I think prime days are happening kind of right now, so I think that's going to give us some indication. It's a little bit of a run-up to the holidays to see where consumers are leaning in and what they're looking at. I continue to think everything we hear is, the consumer balance sheet continues to be challenged. And so I think consumers are spending, but they're being choosy on where and how they spend their money. And I think it will be similar in the holiday season. They're going to look for items that really meet a specific need or items that they really think will bring delight to who they're giving the gifts to. And so that's -- I think that kind of macro sentiment is going to carry-over into the holiday. I think promotion-wise, again, consumers are looking for value. What I really see is where consumers are shopping. So you're seeing customers and retailers like Walmart, Costco doing really well and those are the retailers that consumers think of when they think, I'm getting a good value when I'm shopping in those places or they're interested in events like Prime Day and things like that. When it comes to our promotional planning, we have promotional plans for all of our brands across the year kind of coming into the year. And to those key tentpole events and those key windows are things that we'll continue to support. I don't see us doing anything dramatically different in terms of depth of discount. I would say, for example, in the Prime Days right now, our breadth of assortment is a little bit broader than what we've done in the past. So Osprey is participating for the first time. But a lot of that is more because Osprey is diversifying into adjacent categories like the daypacks, the everyday lifestyle packs. And so we've got items that make sense to participate there and it's an important tentpole event. So I see us continuing to look at -- as our brands expand into these categories, where are these opportunities to participate in tentpole events, but I don't see us doing major depth discounts in light of where the consumer is right now. Susan Anderson: Okay, great. That was very helpful. Maybe if I could just add one more. If you could talk about the cadence of gross margin, I guess, between the third and fourth quarter in the back half. Are you expecting any differences there? Maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes also versus the first half? Thanks. Brian Grass: Yes, I would say just if you compare Q2, our gross margin was below our expectations and there were a couple things going on there that we wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat like year-over-year inventory obsolescence and then a little bit of margin compression that we did see in Q2 because we launched at Costco. We had lower DTC, which I think is going to normalize, and then we had a little bit higher closeouts. So those all weighed on the margin, but I expect that to normalize and get back more towards a prior year and maybe slightly above prior year in the second half. And sorry, what was the second question? Susan Anderson: That was it. Well, I guess just the difference between the first half and then the third and fourth quarter as well. Brian Grass: Okay. Yes, I'd say third and fourth quarter are very similar, and both pretty consistent with prior year, maybe slightly above. Susan Anderson: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Good luck for the rest of the year. Brian Grass: Thank you. Noel Geoffroy: Thanks, Susan. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments. Noel Geoffroy: Thank you all for joining us today as we share the significant progress we are making to reset and revitalize our business this fiscal year. We believe we're taking the right steps on the path to sustainable long-term top line growth, and we really look forward to updating you all on our progress on future calls. Thanks so much. Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Title: China markets follow U.S. rise with lift from new Beijing stimulus optimism

Full Content:
Shares in mainland China rebounded as traders found renewed optimism for more stimulus measures. Traders around the word awaited U.S. inflation data for September—and the implications it will have for rate cuts at the Federal Reserve’s November meeting. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai rise on stimulus optimism rebound A day after China’s mainland shares took a steep dive, Shanghai’s SSE Composite rose 1.32%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped another 2.98% as stimulus optimism returned. Markets were aided by Beijing’s announcement that its finance minister will give another stimulus briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York. The mood was tempered by producer prices, which increased 2.8%, above the 2.3% expected by economists. Europe: Shares waver ahead of U.S. CPI as GSK soars on court settlement European stocks slid slightly early Thursday as traders there also prepared for the release of U.S inflation data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down a marginal 0.09% in early trading, saved from steeper losses by an over 5% surge in GSK over news that the pharma giant had reached a $2.2 billion deal to settle thousands of claims in U.S. courts that linked cancer cases to its heartburn drug Zantac. The STOXX Europe 600 was down 0.21%. U.S. premarket slips with inflation numbers in focus A day after all three markets posted ample rises—and the Dow and S&P 500 both set fresh records—the main U.S. indexes were all down slightly in premarket trading Thursday. Investors awaited the pre-market release of September CPI inflation numbers, which will have implications for the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates—or not—in November. On Wednesday, cruise lines saw their shares surge as oil prices dropped, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings leading the pack with a 10.91% gain. The announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet—which dropped 1.59%—and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. And earnings season continues… Delta Air Lines reports today, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Ark's ARKB ETF leads Bitcoin outflows as BlackRock's IBIT remains an exception. On Oct. 8, 2024, Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows totaling $18.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led the declines with $48.8 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC ETF recorded a smaller outflow of $9.4 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the only notable inflow, adding $39.6 million. Other major ETFs reported no significant activity, including those from Ark, Bitwise, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree. By Oct. 9, the outflows continued with a total net loss of $30.6 million. Ark’s ARKB ETF led the day’s outflows, losing $44.5 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded a modest inflow of $13.9 million. No inflows or outflows were reported for Fidelity’s FBTC or other major ETFs, marking a quiet day across the broader Bitcoin ETF market. In Ethereum ETFs, Oct. 8 saw a total outflow of $8.1 million, driven primarily by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which posted $3.6 million in outflows, and Bitwise’s ETHW ETF, which lost $4.5 million. Other Ethereum ETFs, including those from BlackRock, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale, reported no inflows or outflows. On Oct. 9, Ethereum ETFs remained static, with no reported activity across all funds, signaling a pause in investor activity in Ethereum-backed products after the previous day’s outflows. The continued outflows in Bitcoin ETFs over these two days, particularly from Ark and Fidelity, reflect ongoing investor caution. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF remains one of the few funds consistently attracting inflows. Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, saw limited activity, with modest outflows on Oct. 8 and no significant movement on Oct. 9. This dynamic suggests a broader market consolidation as investors reassess their positions across both Bitcoin and Ethereum assets.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months.

Title: GOOGL vs. META: Which AI/Big Data Stock Is Better?

Time Published: 2024-10-10T06:46:09Z
Full Content:
In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising. Shares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%. The two companies’ equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there’s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order. Notably, advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Alphabet’s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it’s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing. At the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he’s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet’s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term. Nonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models. Despite Yiu’s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they’re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon. Even if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that’s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation. Thus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don’t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%. Additionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We’re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises. Alphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%. See more GOOGL analyst ratings At a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate. Meta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful. Yiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google. Further, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu’s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements. I would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don’t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta’s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google’s growth rate. However, it’s important to consider that Alphabet’s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta’s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2. Meta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%. See more META analyst ratings Although both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet’s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue. On the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it’s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues. However, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.

Title: Japan to introduce self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with a 90% adverse event rate, and the U.S. is next in line

In clinical trials, a near 90 percent adverse event rate was recorded after the first dose. These adverse events were disregarded, however, as Japan approved the jab. The United States is also looking to approve these jabs in the coming years. Worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine will be released in Japan ARCT-154 became the worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines â which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists â saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This "biological printing press" could theoretically amplify the vaccineâs presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, âThese products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.â In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time. Gritstone Bio has previously received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to capitalize on their vaccine investments. Gritstone Bioâs partners also include BlackRock and State Street, official partners of the World Economic Forum. These bioweapon investments are too-big-to-fail, and the courts are not holding vaccine manufacturers accountable for harming millions, so it's likely that saRNA vaccines will be coming to the U.S. soon.

Sources include: ChildrensHealthDefense.org WhiteHouse.gov Nature.com ARCT-154 became the worldâs first self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after receiving approval from Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in November 2023. It was developed by biotechnology firm CSL in collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics. Unlike mRNA vaccines â which only produce the spike protein necessary for immune response as long as the mRNA persists â saRNA vaccines are engineered to create copies of themselves and the proteins they encode. This "biological printing press" could theoretically amplify the vaccineâs presence and multiply its effects within the body indefinitely. According to CSL, the vaccine demonstrated higher immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile compared to original mRNA vaccines during clinical trials. However, independent vaccine researchers are voicing serious concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this untested technology. Dr. Nicolas Hulscher stated, âThese products are completely new. There is absolutely no long-term safety data on them.â In trials for ARCT-154, he noted a near 90 percent adverse event rate after the first dose, with clinicians observing significant systemic reactions in participants. Serious and medically-attended adverse events were only recorded from Day 1 to Day 92. Karina Acevedo Whitehouse, a microbiology professor, emphasized the lack of comprehensive studies on the long-term effects of self-amplifying mRNA technology. She pointed out that there are no assessments of potential cellular transformations, including the risks of cancerous mutations or inflammatory responses. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be,â she warned. âThere have also been no studies conducted on trans-generational effects â for instance, teratogenicity [birth defects] â of self-amplifying mRNA injections,â she said. âWe simply do not know what the consequences could be.â Further raising concerns, a Cambridge University study revealed that original mRNA vaccines could trigger unintended immune responses in a third of recipients, leading to possible autoimmune reactions. Whitehouse linked the increase in certain cancers observed since 2021 to the effects of mRNA technology on cellular pathways. Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which include an enzyme that allows for the replication of the injected mRNA, may pose even greater risks than the original mRNA vaccines. Experts suggest that the sustained antigen production could lead to heightened risks, making these new vaccines akin to âconventional mRNA injections on steroids,â as Hulscher described. U.S. considers using self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are really runaway bioweapons The United States is planning to use these new vaccines. The Biden regime has already partnered with several companies to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccines for future plandemics. In other words, companies are conspiring to create a line of self-amplifying vaccines so they can profit from future virus constructs and subsequent pandemic messaging and vaccine marketing campaigns. CastleVax, Codagenix and Gritstone Bio have already received contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services under the federal governmentâs Project NextGen. Project NextGen claims to accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments by spearheading public-private collaborations. In September of 2023, Gritstone Bio locked in a $433 million contract to simply âconduct a mid-stage study of its self -amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate,â so there have been products in development for some time.

The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under new CEO Andy Jassy Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans' cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. "Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer's name or address to ensure they have the right packages," Amazon said in a release. "They simply have to look for VAPR's green light, grab and go." The announcement underscores Amazon's shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones - a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon's low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

Title: Big tech is bringing nuclear power back to life

One of the two reactors at a nuclear-power plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania had suffered an accident. The governor ordered an evacuation of all vulnerable people within five miles of the plant as radioactive gas escaped. In the end, the accident resulted in no injuries or loss of life. Two decades later, The Economist visited the Pennsylvania hinterlands and found the second, unproblematic reactor still running well and enjoying strong local support. It cranked out power until it was mothballed in 2019 owing not to safety concerns but to competition from cheap shale gas. Now Three Mile Island is coming back from the dead. On September 20th Microsoft, a tech giant, and Constellation Energy, the utility that decommissioned the trouble-free reactor, signed a deal to return it to service. The utility will spend about $1.6bn to restore the plant by 2028. Microsoft will then buy its carbon-free power for the next 20 years. Having plunged through the 1990s and 2000s, the share of global nuclear power generated by new plants is now rising again (see chart 1). Although America is home to 94 conventional nuclear reactors, about a fifth of the world’s total, it has built few in recent decades. There are, however, over five dozen nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, mostly in China and Russia but increasingly in other places, too (see chart 2). In July, for instance, the Czech Republic finalised plans for a $17bn nuclear project. And interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), which are cheaper and quicker to build, is surging everywhere. A new age for nuclear power may be dawning. Demand from tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google, all of which are racing to find sufficient clean power to feed the data centres underpinning the artificial-intelligence (AI) boom, is turbocharging the nuclear revival. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, explains that even before AI came along, his firm’s promise to remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than it has contributed during its entire history was ambitious. Now, thanks to AI, he reckons Microsoft will consume five to six times as much electricity by 2030 as it anticipated when it set the goal in 2020. Nuclear power is well suited to data centres because it provides a reliable source of clean energy around the clock, unlike wind and solar, notes David Victor of the University of California at San Diego. The vast scale of nuclear-power plants also makes them attractive: running an AI data centre can require as much as a gigawatt (GW) of power. That could be provided by millions of solar panels—or just a single nuclear-power plant. Unfortunately, there are few decommissioned nuclear reactors in America, Europe and Japan that would be suitable for big tech to resurrect. New plants will therefore need to be built. These projects absorb enormous amounts of capital and are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations and long delays. What is more, the risk of overruns is higher today because the supply chains and expertise needed to build nuclear power have atrophied, at least outside China and Russia. A case in point is the recently opened Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, America’s first in decades. It cost $35bn, more than double the initial estimate, and was completed seven years late. One way for tech giants to mitigate the risk is to bring in outside investors. Last month Microsoft teamed up with BlackRock, an asset manager, and other investors to launch a $30bn infrastructure fund devoted to AI. Mr Smith, who says the fund’s firepower could rise to $100bn once debt is added, expects it to finance nuclear projects, among other things. He also expects three or four such funds led by other tech firms to emerge, and suggests that Microsoft “may participate in all of them". At the same time, tech titans have taken a growing interest in SMRs. Currently there are only two in operation, in China and Russia. But Western manufacturers of power equipment such as GE Vernova and Rolls Royce have been busily developing models of them, as have numerous startups. TerraPower, an SMR startup backed by Bill Gates, broke ground on its first plant in Wyoming in August. Oklo, another startup which counts Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, among its backers, intends to deploy several small nuclear plants by 2030. Earlier this year it signed an agreement to provide Equinix, a data-centre operator, with 500 megawatts of nuclear power that includes a prepayment that should help it fund construction. There are more SMRs planned or under construction in America than anywhere else in the world, thanks in large part to enthusiasm from the tech industry. Last month Oracle, a software giant, unveiled plans for a GW-scale data centre to be powered by three SMRs for which the firm has already secured permits. On October 3rd Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google, confirmed that his firm is also looking into SMRs to power its data centres. Chain reactionStill, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale. Meanwhile, the hefty and uncertain price tag of building conventional nuclear-power plants will continue to weigh on the industry’s growth—and big tech’s hopes of powering the AI revolution without spewing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Chris Womack, the chief executive of the Southern Company, which owns the nuclear plant in Georgia, reckons that public support would help. “The government must provide some cost-overrun insurance," he argues. Streamlining lengthy permitting processes would be even better. Governments certainly seem to be warming towards nuclear power, after decades of frostiness. At an event held during UN Climate Week in New York last month, officials lined up to reaffirm a commitment made by over 20 countries at the cop climate summit in Dubai last year to triple the global output of nuclear power by 2050. Fourteen big banks also said they are ready to finance new nuclear projects. Pointing to the surge in demand from AI, Mohamed Al Hammadi, head of the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, declared: “We have witnessed a step change in momentum across the nuclear sector." For it to continue, a mix of technical ingenuity, financial wizardry and supportive policy will be needed. Still, the technology behind SMRs remains unproven at scale.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Inflows Jump To $235 Million – Is The Bull Market Heating Up?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-etf-inflows-jump-to-235-million-is-the-bull-market-heating-up/

Bitcoin’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are once again generating headlines due to an extraordinary increase in inflows. An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US Selling Pressure Slams Bitcoin ETFs: $408 Million in Outflows

Bitcoin (BTC) appears stuck at the $62,000 threshold today as selling pressure from institutional investors obscures its gains. Critical data, such as the Coinbase Premium Index and ETF outflows, shows that US institutions are leading the sell-off. Moreover, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed notable outflows, with more than $408 million exiting the funds in the first week of October. This bearish market outlook has affected Bitcoin’s overall performance in October. According to CryptoQuant data, one clear indicator of Bitcoin’s troubles is the negative Coinbase Premium Index. This index tracks the price difference between Coinbase and Binance for Bitcoin. The index has stayed in negative territory in October, meaning that Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase is lower than on Binance. This suggests that US institutions sell more Bitcoin than global retail buyers, exerting a stronger bearish momentum on the asset. Another on-chain analyst, Maartunn, shared this information. Maartum noted, “The Coinbase Premium has fallen to -$41, signaling strong selling pressure from US institutions.” The Coinbase Premium has fallen to -$41, signaling strong selling pressure from U.S. institutions 😬 pic.twitter.com/mjKcfIaJ0s — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 8, 2024 One X user believes the impact of this negative data will likely “be felt tomorrow, not today.” Typically, positive readings from this index are followed by BTC price gains, while negative ones like the recent data signal declines. Concerns about a possible Bitcoin correction have grown, but the index is still negative. Another vital factor to consider is the outflow from BTC ETFs in the US. Coinglass data shows that BTC ETFs saw net outflows of over $408 million in the first week of October. This outflow suggests that US investors are withdrawing money from Bitcoin-related investments. In contrast, only around $260 million has flowed into these ETFs during the same period. This imbalance further points to a selling trend. BlackRock, a major player in the ETF space, also recorded significant withdrawals recently. CryptoQuant reported that the company withdrew 256 BTC, marking the second-biggest outflow from BlackRock. According to Glassnode’s recent report, a tool called UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows that Bitcoin is now in a delicate price zone. “This paints a picture of a market that rests on delicate ground, with a large volume of supply likely to be sensitive to the next major market move,” said Glassnode. URPD often measures how much Bitcoin was traded at different price levels. In addition, Glassnode wrote that a large volume of Bitcoin has been traded at around $62,600, making it a fundamental level. So, if Bitcoin fails to hold this price and drops below $60,000, there could be further declines toward $52,000. Conversely, if Bitcoin breaks the resistance at $64,000, it could quickly rally past $72,000. Meanwhile, most short-term holders are profitable, with a profit-to-loss ratio 1.2.

Title: Oracle Price Levels to Watch as Stock Sets Record High

Oracle (ORCL) shares hit a record high Wednesday following a report that ChatGPT maker OpenAI is looking beyond Microsoft (MSFT) to supply servers, paving the way for a potential new partnership with the enterprise software giant. Tech industry focused publication The Information reported that OpenAI’s leadership recently told staff that the company planned to take on a larger role in securing data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) chips, rather than relying exclusively on Microsoft. In June, the company rented Oracle servers at a new data center in Texas with limited input from Microsoft, according to the report. At the time, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman said that the software company’s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) would allow it to scale, while Oracle CEO Larry Ellison pointed out that AI leaders such as OpenAI are turning to the company for its fast, cost-effective AI infrastructure. Oracle shares have surged around 25% in the past month and gained nearly 70% year-to-date through Wednesday’s close, boosted in part by a recent multicloud partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN) cloud business. The stock rose 2.3% to close Wednesday's session at $178.29, after hitting an all-time high of $178.61. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle's weekly chart and use technical analysis to point out important price levels to watch out for. Oracle shares traded within a three-year rising wedge before staging a decisive volume-backed breakout above the pattern last month. Since that time, the stock has continued to trend sharply higher, though share turnover has decreased following the initial breakout. While, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also cautions of short-term overbought conditions with a reading above 80. It’s worth pointing out that the last time the indicator flashed above this threshold in June last year, the stock underwent a correction of around 22% over the following six months. We’ll now identify three important lower chart area that could come into play during pullbacks and use a bars pattern to project a price target if the stock continues its long-term uptrend. The first location to monitor sits around $146, an area on the chart where the shares could find initial support around the July swing high and wedge pattern’s top trendline. Selling below this level could see the shares revisit the $127 level, a region just below the wedge’s lower trendline that would likely encounter support from multiple highs on the chart between June 2023 and May this year, which also closely aligns with the 2024 August low and upward sloping 50-week moving average (MA). A deeper correction could bring the psychological $100 round number into play. Investors would likely look for buying opportunities in this area near the closely-watched 200-week MA and prominent peaks and troughs that formed on the chart from October 2021 to December last year. A bars pattern uses historical trends to predict future moves. To apply this technique on Oracle’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from October 2022 to June last year and overlay it from the August low, which projects a price target of around $250. We selected this earlier trending period because it began from the rising wedge’s lower trendline, similar to how the stock’s current move higher started. Interestingly, the prior trend played out over 36 weeks, meaning a comparable move could potentially last until early April if price history were to rhyme.

Title: Letters: Dublin Bus has changed with the times – and not always for the better

Dublin Bus is putting security guards on services to combat antisocial behaviour. Photo: Getty The Dublin Bus pilot scheme – in which security guards will be on buses to tackle antisocial behaviour – has to be welcomed by staff and customers alike. The news is also tinged with sadness that this is where we are now. Many of us remember the friendly, efficient and helpful bus conductors of times past. They were great ambassadors for public bus service and our capital city. We are reminded daily of the speed in which people in so many areas of public service people have been replaced by technology. Yes, technology has been so beneficial, and it continues to grow, yet it will never replace being face to face with a fellow human being. Dublin Bus might also consider having some staff available to check the occupancy of clearly designated seats for vulnerable passengers. As a daily user of public transport, I see young children in those seats, while elderly, disabled and pregnant women cling to the rails for dear life to get to their destination. Alice Leahy, Alice Leahy Trust, Dublin 8 According to a newspaper report last weekend, Russian agents succeeded in “honeytrapping” an Irish parliamentarian into working for them. Apparently their recruitment criteria included someone with a large ego, sex drive and dubious links. Based on these selection criteria, which TDs and senators can we eliminate from our enquiries? Frank Schnittger, Blessington, Co Wicklow The Bible says “Love one another with brotherly affection” (Romans 12:10) and Donald Trump has certainly lived up to this. In his latest book, War, veteran reporter Bob Woodward tells us that Trump provided medical support to his political “brother” Vladimir Putin, by sending him Covid tests (they share a great fear of germs). They also stay in contact by phone. The suggestion by Trump that he would end the war in Ukraine if he wins next month’s US presidential election isn’t likely to be as a result of his skills as a negotiator, but his total capitulation to Putin. This isn’t really a friendship of equals. Trump is desperately seeking the approval of a perceived strongman, who is actually a tyrant. Who needs enemies when you have friends like this? The final word on this friendship can be attributed to Sun Tzu, the Chinese military general, who is credited with the phrase “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer”. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne Denis Doyle mentions that the late Kris Kristofferson supported the Palestinian cause (‘Kris Kristofferson was a steadfast social activist and proud political outlaw’, Irish Independent, Letters, October 9). Johnny Cash was Kristofferson’s fellow member of The Highwaymen country supergroup. Together with his wife June Carter-Cash, he was a regular visitor to Israel. In the mid-1990s, when Israeli cities, and particularly Jerusalem, were attacked by Palestinian suicide bombers, tourism to Israel fell off sharply. The Cashes, then in their 60s, travelled to Israel and with their own money, made a TV film titled Return to the Holy Land. Throughout the film the Cashes told their fans that Israel was as safe and beautiful as ever and that they should not hesitate to visit. Their love of Israel still resonates with me and others to this day. Karl Martin, Bayside, Dublin 13 The RTÉ Investigates programme on treatment of bull calves destined for export will have shocked anyone with a whit of compassion for animals. The programme covered topics such as calves being beaten, prodded with pitchforks, dragged by the ears, and carcasses left to rot, posing a disease risk. And that’s even before we consider the ethics of sending animals on excessively long and stressful sea journeys to slaughter. I suspect even the hardest heart would have been moved, if only for a few seconds, by the sight and sound of those calves, with their soulful, pleading eyes – animals consigned to distant shores by people seemingly oblivious to the suffering. We have a serious animal cruelty problem in Ireland. Whether it’s a bull calf earmarked for export, a severely confined battery hen, a horse being prodded or whipped, or a hare in front of two hyped-up dogs, no animal deserves to have its short life turned into veritable hell on earth. John Fitzgerald, Callan, Co Kilkenny When I started education in the mid-1950s, many teachers asserted their authority by beating their pupils. Thankfully, those days are long gone. But there appears to be a residue of a thirst for control by educators. This nonsense of banning mobile phones in secondary schools and placing them in pouches is a perfect example. The expense does not concern me. But the motive behind it does. We pride ourselves as a hi-tech nation, and rightly so. Tens of thousands of jobs are provided in the sector. Am I alone in wondering about the absurdity of this device ban? I’m 72. I’ve seen how administration worked in the pencil-and-paper era, and how technology has revolutionised the way that we now do business. Are we seriously asking smart teenagers to go back to the business equivalent of the ass and cart during school hours? I can only conclude that the Department of Education and the teaching profession see it as a way to assert authority for its own sake. Larry Dunne, Rosslare, Co Wexford The decision of the UK government not to contribute any further to the rebuilding of Casement Park in Belfast ahead of the Euro 28 football tournament makes it imperative for the GAA and the Irish Government to fill that void on a 50-50 basis. Only an immediate formal declaration to this effect can now save that laudable project. Even if, at present, the completion of the project is found to be over-ambitious, a partial completion of the project is to be preferred rather than leaving the stadium to fester as an eyesore.

Speaking to newspersons after his return from a two-day trip from New Delhi here on Wednesday, Naidu said there should be a search for alternatives for tiding over the losses of the plant. The previous YSR Congress Party Government in the state led by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy never opposed the proposal to privatise VSP during 2019-24 and now had `no moral right’ to criticise the NDA Government in the State on the issue, he added.

We expect growth in the company’s wealth segment to be driven by advisory followed by distribution and lending activities. We expect its wealth recurring AUM to see a 23% CAGR over the next 3 years (FY24-27E) vs. a 20% CAGR for asset management AUM and a 16% CAGR for overall AUM. We expect an annual recurring revenue (ARR) CAGR of 21% vs. 15-16% overall revenue CAGR over the next 3 years, with transaction-based revenue (TBR) run-rate to remain Rs5.0-5.5bn. With increasing penetration of mutual funds, strong growth in the portfolio management services (PMS) and alternative investment funds (AIF) segments (preferred tools of HNWI investors), direct investment in equities and growth in unlisted equities, we expect to see a structural re-rating of non-lending stocks in India. Although the stock recently re-rated, we see room for further upside and initiate at Buy.

Though the stock has re-rated (trading 45% above five-year average P/E), we believe the market is still underappreciating its medium-term EPS growth potential (15.6% CAGR over FY24-29E vs. 12.4% implied growth at current valuations), despite our estimates being below consensus, leaving room for a potential further re-rating, in our view. 09 October 2024 (Rs.

The company said this strategic collaboration is aimed at helping Infosys and Microsoft’s joint customers realize the value of their technology investments and secure transformative outcomes. Yields of Government Securities (G-Secs) thawed on Wednesday as the monetary policy committee (MPC) changed the policy stance to “neutral” from “withdrawal of accommodation” and FTSE Russell said it will include these securities in its Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI).Yield of the benchmark 10-year G-Sec (coupon rate: 7.10 per cent) softened 4 basis points to close at 6.77 per cent from previous close of 6.81 per cent.

Britannia Bel Foods, a key player in India’s cheese market, has taken a significant step in its growth journey by announcing the inauguration of its new cheese factory in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra. This facility will locally produce “Britannia The Laughing Cow” cheese products, deepening the joint venture between Britannia and France’s Bel Group, which began nearly two years ago. The plant represents a investment of approximately ₹220 crores and aims to produce 10,000 tons of high-quality cheese annually to meet the increasing demand from Indian consumers. An Independent Investigation Committee (IIC) constituted by the Board of Directors of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEE), has found no irregularities in the functioning of the company. “The Committee also noted that the transactions (under investigation) did not adversely affect the Company or its shareholders. The mentioned transactions were found to be a part of normal course of business, and no material irregularities were reported within the same,” said a press release. In the order released on August 14 2023, SEBI confirmed that Goenka along with his father Subhash Chandra will not be allowed to hold the position of a Director or a KMP in ZEEL or any of its subsidiaries, while the market regulator completes its investigation on the matter. The order by the capital markets regulator came on the back of an investigation into allegations related to the appropriation of certain fixed deposits of Zee by Yes Bank for squaring off loans of related entities of Essel Group ‘ Listen to your employees. Listen to your customers Shut... the ef up. And do what they tell you.’ This was the mantra adopted by the maverick CEO of T-Mobile USA - John Legere, in delivering one of the most remarkable transformations of a company in corporate history. When he took the reigns of T-Mobile USA in 2012/13 it was a weak fourth player in USA with around 34 million wireless subscribers in an industry dominated by two giants – AT&T and Verizon with 78 and 98 million wireless subscribers respectively. The third player Sprint Nextel too had a wide lead over T-Mobile USA with 55 million subscribers.

It is likely to move north-west into the open waters and intensify into a depression over central Arabian Sea during next three to four days. Read more With the inflation closer to the 4 per cent target and growth sustaining its momentum, the RBI’s rate setting panel voted unanimously to change the monetary policy stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral”, a move that was widely expected. This action could be a precursor to a rate cut as early as in the December 2024 bi-monthly monetary policy review. However, the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), which has three new external members, chose by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to hold the policy repo rate steady at 6.50 per cent as the pace of disinflation has been slow and uneven. Only the newly appointed Nagesh Kumar voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.

Kenneth Duda, the Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Arista Networks , Inc. (NYSE:ANET), has sold shares worth over $15 million according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions, which took place on October 7, 2024, involved multiple sales at varying prices, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $15,778,727. The SEC filing indicates that Duda sold shares in a series of transactions. The sales were executed at weighted average prices ranging from $391.03 to $398.98. The total number of shares sold directly by Duda amounted to $7,893,864 worth, while an additional $6,315,089 worth of shares were sold indirectly through a children's trust. Shares sold by a foundation associated with Duda totaled $1,578,774. Investors often watch insider transactions such as these for signals about the company’s performance and insiders' confidence in the company's future. The transactions by Duda were conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows insiders to set up a predetermined schedule to sell stocks at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information, to avoid accusations of insider trading. Arista Networks, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, specializes in computer communications equipment and has been known for its cloud networking solutions. The filing also showed that Duda acquired 20,000 shares through an option exercise at a price of $17.085 per share, totaling $341,700. Following the sales, the SEC report detailed that Duda's direct ownership in the company decreased, although the exact number of shares retained has not been disclosed. As of the filing date, Kenneth Duda had not engaged in any buy transactions of Arista Networks stock. The company and Duda have not publicly commented on the sales as of yet. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been the center of attention due to a number of updates. The company reported a strong Q2 performance, with revenues hitting $1.69 billion, marking a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks, projecting approximately 20% revenue growth for 2024 and 2025. The firm also anticipated Arista to achieve its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025, thanks to the transition from pilot to production in significant AI cluster projects. In addition, Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s development of a massive new AI model training cluster, which could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Deutsche Bank also maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. These recent developments highlight Arista Networks' strong market position and potential for continued growth. To provide additional context to Kenneth Duda's recent stock transactions, it's worth examining Arista Networks' current financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Arista Networks boasts a substantial market capitalization of $128.27 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the communications equipment industry. The company's stock has shown remarkable strength, with a 107.19% price total return over the past year. This impressive performance aligns with an InvestingPro Tip indicating that Arista Networks has been trading near its 52-week high, with the current price at 99.46% of that peak. Such robust stock performance might provide some context for insider selling, as executives may choose to realize gains after significant price appreciation. Financially, Arista Networks appears to be in a solid position. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, suggesting financial stability. This is further supported by the fact that Arista's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, indicating a strong liquidity position. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of Arista Networks' financial health and market position, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's strengths and potential areas of concern. The article to enrich: Kenneth Duda, the Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET), has sold shares worth over $15 million according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions, which took place on October 7, 2024, involved multiple sales at varying prices, resulting in a total sale value of approximately $15,778,727. The SEC filing indicates that Duda sold shares in a series of transactions. The sales were executed at weighted average prices ranging from $391.03 to $398.98. The total number of shares sold directly by Duda amounted to $7,893,864 worth, while an additional $6,315,089 worth of shares were sold indirectly through a children's trust. Shares sold by a foundation associated with Duda totaled $1,578,774. Investors often watch insider transactions such as these for signals about the company's performance and insiders' confidence in the company's future. The transactions by Duda were conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows insiders to set up a predetermined schedule to sell stocks at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information, to avoid accusations of insider trading. Arista Networks, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, specializes in computer communications equipment and has been known for its cloud networking solutions. The filing also showed that Duda acquired 20,000 shares through an option exercise at a price of $17.085 per share, totaling $341,700. Following the sales, the SEC report detailed that Duda's direct ownership in the company decreased, although the exact number of shares retained has not been disclosed. As of the filing date, Kenneth Duda had not engaged in any buy transactions of Arista Networks stock. The company and Duda have not publicly commented on the sales as of yet.

Title: Amazon unveils AI tool to help drivers find packages faster

Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new artificial intelligence tool designed to solve a major pain point in its quick delivery apparatus: drivers rummaging through cluttered vans at each stop searching for packages. The technology projects a green circle on packages to be delivered at each stop and red Xs on those to be delivered later, Amazon said Wednesday at a Nashville media event focused on its logistics and online shopping initiatives. Called Vision Assisted Package Retrieval and in development since 2020, the tool will be deployed in 1,000 Amazon vans next year and will shorten the typical delivery route by about 30 minutes, the company said. The tool uses computer-vision technology initially developed in Amazon warehouses to identify products without using barcode scanners. The technology was adapted for vans’ cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software. “Delivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer’s name or address to ensure they have the right packages,” Amazon said in a release. “They simply have to look for VAPR’s green light, grab and go.” The announcement underscores Amazon’s shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones — a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it. Under Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon’s low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits. The Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages. By reducing delivery times, Amazon can limit what it has to pay these delivery service partners, which typically hire drivers paid by the hour.

Title: UBS ‘quantimental’ framework identifies a surprise U.S. company as its highest ranking stock
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/ubs-quantimental-framework-identifies-a-surprise-u-s-company-as-its-highest-ranking-stock/

United States growth companies are killing it, according to a report published today by Zurich-based UBS. Titled ‘Theme-ometer,’ the report includes a list of 20 companies that rank highest and 20 ranked lowest, based on the bank’s proprietary “quantimental stock selection framework” that breaks down company performance into four categories: the macro economic regime (R), the operating environment for earnings (E), the market assessment of valuations (V), and by sentiment (S). That’s REVS for short. Six of the top seven highest ranked companies to make the UBS list are from the U.S. They include Fortinet, a 24-year-old cybersecurity company that has grown explosively since Covid caused the work-from-home population to balloon. Its stock price grew by 34.25% over the past year alone, to $79.89 today. Only Madrid-based Endesa, an electric company in UBS’s EU Listed Eurozone Exposure theme out-ranked the other six U.S. companies. Of note, as with most bank research, UBS “does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports,” according to the report, so as always, a degree of caution is necessary when interpreting the results. “The US Growth theme is among the highest ranking in our REVS framework,” wrote lead author, and UBS U.S. strategist, Sean Simonds, and the rest his team. Other U.S. Growth leaders were Meta, Docusign, Monday.com, Uber and Cardinal Health. The quantimental stock selection framework gives companies a weighted score, with 30% based on the macro economic regime (or the larger economic context), 30% going to earnings, 15% going to valuations and 25% going to sentiment, according to Simonds in an email to Fortune. Sunnyvale, California-based Fortinet scored a 0.63 out of a perfect score of one. Endesa, the Madrid based utility, came in second with a score of 0.61. Founded by brothers Ken and Michael Xie in 2000, Fortinet was a slow grower for its first 20 years, climbing to $23.62 as of November 2020. That month, as Covid quarantine forced clients to stay home, the stock started a year of nearly non-stop growth, hitting $69 in December 2021. In August, Fortinet bought artificial intelligence cloud security firm Lacework for an undisclosed amount, and is currently valued at $61.4 billion. Other themes ranked highly by UBS were EU Listed Eurozone Exposure, GLP-1 Winner (tracking the industry around the Glucagon-like peptides in Ozempic), and EU Renewables. The worst performing themes included European Value stocks such as BP, Listed China Exposure, including L’Oreal, and U.S. Low Income Consumer, including Monster Beverage, Autozone, and Dollar General, all of which “are among the lowest scoring stocks in these themes,” according to the report. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Utility Stocks Come Down From AI-Driven Highs

Time Published: 2024-10-09T21:51:03Z

Shares of power generators Constellation Energy (CEG), NRG Energy (NRG), and Vistra (VST) posted some of the steepest losses in the S&P 500 on Wednesday. The declines came after all three stocks ended last week with record highs on enthusiasm about opportunities to benefit from growing energy demand for data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI). The retreat for the red-hot electric utility stocks came as several analysts expressed concerns about the sustainability of their valuations following massive AI-driven gains this year. Although many analysts remain bullish about the upside potential for companies like Constellation, NRG, and Vistra as they could help meet the large energy demand needed to power AI, BTIG analysts suggested utilities could be set for a correction of around 7% to 10%. According to BTIG's analysis, the sector's valuation appears "stretched" relative to its historical levels, and utilities tend to drop off following periods of outperformance versus the broader markets. SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert echoed that utility stocks have a history of reversing their momentum after strong runs, and added any cracks in the "new narrative about AI" could hit confidence in returns. Constellation Energy was the weakest performer of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday, plunging 6.1%. NRG Energy shares dropped 5.3%, while Vistra stock slipped almost 3%. Despite the declines, all three stocks remained solidly in positive territory for 2024. Constellation shares have more than doubled in value since the start of the year, while NRG stock is up more than 70%. Vistra, meanwhile, remains the S&P 500's top-performing stock this year, having more than tripled in value over the period.

Wall Street continued gaining Wednesday, with two major U.S. indexes closing at new record highs. Soaring stocks in the U.S. come in stark contrast to China, where markets plunged on a lack of new stimulus announcements. Here’s a look at the stock market today: US: Wall Street surges on good news for cruise linesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both set fresh records on Wednesday, as oil prices dropped and cruise lines saw stocks surge. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings led the pack, closing up 10.91%. The Dow climbed 1.03% while the S&P 500 was up 0.71%. The Nasdaq also gained, climbing 0.60%, but the announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet and the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Europe: Markets close up across the board despite Germany’s shrinking economy The German government said Wednesday that it expects its economy to shrink for a second year, but the DAX Performance Index still closed up 0.99% as gains in tech, retail and industrials boosted shares. Markets rose slightly early in the day, but really gained once trading opened in the U.S. where investors are eyeing the release of minutes from the latest Federal Reserve Board meeting. The STOXX Europe 600 closed up 0.66%. China: Stimulus sadness slumps stocks A day after Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index experienced its sharpest one-day drop since 2008, mainland Chinese stocks also saw a significant decline. The Shanghai SSE Composite fell by 6.62%, while Hong Kong shed another 1.38% as investors remained unconvinced by Beijing’s Tuesday briefing on its stimulus plans, which lacked substantial details and new major measures. China’s finance minister is set to provide another update on Saturday, with investors hoping for more robust actions to stimulate the economy. Japan: Nikkei rises as 7-Eleven owner shares rise on higher bidIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.87%, driven by a surge in Seven & i Holdings shares. The retailer’s stock jumped as much as 11.7% before closing up 4.71%, following news that Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard had raised its takeover bid by about 20%, according to Bloomberg. Tech stocks also gained as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament ahead of the snap elections on October 27, aiming to strengthen his position. Finally, earnings season is here: Wells Fargo and BlackRock will share their earnings on Friday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Elon Musk's 'We, Robot' event is on the horizon. Here's what you need to know
URL: https://qz.com/tesla-robotaxi-we-robot-elon-musk-ai-fsd-product-launch-1851669136
Time Published: 2024-10-09T20:40:00Z
Full Content:
Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is primed to unveil his company’s efforts to produce a self-driving “robotaxi,” either delivering a massive win for investors that justifies sacrificing a widely anticipated car — or a major disappointment. Musk has been talking about developing a robotaxi network since at least April 2019, when he spoke about a fleet of autonomous Teslas that could drive customers around whenever their owners didn’t need them. The next major update came in 2020 when the CEO said a robotaxi would be unveiled in 2023 and enter production in 2024, which didn’t happen. But on Thursday, after another set of delays, Tesla seems prepared for what Musk has called a “product launch” of the robotaxi. Whether or not it’s a successful launch akin to the 2012 unveiling of the Model X or falls flat like the infamous 2021 debut of Tesla’s Optimus robot, which showed off a person dancing in a costume, is unknown to anyone without insider knowledge. The “We, Robot” event is scheduled to start at 10:00 p.m. ET/7:00 p.m. PT on Thursday at Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD) movie studio near Los Angeles. While the studio floors will be flooded with Wall Street analysts, Tesla influencers, and investors, it will also be livestreamed on X, Musk’s social media platform. Here’s what you need to know. The robotaxi, nicknamed the Cybercab, is expected to be Tesla’s first car that doesn’t require a driver. The Austin, Texas-based company’s electric vehicles offer some self-driving capabilities through its driver assistance software, but a driver is still required. Tesla’s software, Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot, has also been the source of controversy and many headaches for Tesla, ranging from long-fought legal battles to accusations of false advertising. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reviewed 956 crashes where Autopilot was initially reported to be in use. The agency has launched more than three dozen investigations into accidents involving Tesla’s software. According to Bloomberg News, the Cybercab is expected to have two front seats and two doors that open upward like “butterfly wings.” That would line up with the concept art featured in Walter Isaacson’s recent biography of Musk. Musk has also teased that his team will “show off a few other things” on Thursday, which has been linked by some to the three “mystery vehicles” included in Tesla’s presentation at its annual shareholder meeting. Musk is also expected to discuss his firm’s plans to develop and integrate FSD into its Semi truck, which has received a limited release, Bloomberg reports. Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster said last week he expects to see three vehicles, including the “Cybervan” — a rumored autonomous passenger van — and the $25,000 Model 2, which has been reportedly scrapped. Munster expects to see a prototype of the robotaxi, along with previews of the other vehicles. Although Tesla isn’t exactly a stranger to artificial intelligence or autonomy, it’s still going to be behind some rivals. Companies, such as Google’s (GOOGL) Waymo, have been operating autonomous vehicles for years, gathering data all the while, often without the controversies that have plagued Tesla. “Waymo is already way ahead of them, offering thousands of autonomous rides per week in several major cities, and Amazon’s (AMZN) Zoox is on schedule to debut next year,” GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind told Quartz over email. “In the robotaxi space, they don’t have the first mover advantage and that could be costly if it takes them a year or more to officially launch their service.” Tesla will also have to appeal to regulators and the broader public, which remains largely skeptical and even fearful of autonomous vehicles. Thursday’s event will take place on a lot with private roads, which may partially be because Tesla has yet to apply for a deployment permit from Californian authorities, as GLJ Research analyst and Tesla critic Gordon Johnson points out. One positive for the company going into Thursday, as Tesla bull and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Wednesday note, is that it isn’t exactly a slouch when it comes to collecting data. Tesla has more than 1.5 billion miles of FSD — a level 2 automation system, meaning that it is only partially automated — logged in its data centers. “There is clearly a number of hurdles and questions the industry/investors want to hear about including: insurance, cost of the vehicle, timing, regulatory approval timeline, and overall operations among other issues,” Ives said of the event. In June, Musk pitched his vision for a robotaxi network as a “combination of Airbnb and Uber,” since owners can opt their cars into the service at their leisure. He also reiterated his pitch to Tesla owners that they can make money on the self-driving fleet while sleeping, as the company would call cars to pick up customers of its potential ride-hail service through an app. “I’m highly confident that it will far exceed the value” of the monthly payments customers may have to pay for their cars, Musk said at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting. Tesla will take part of the revenue earned from the potential service — which analysts say is likely years away — while the rest will go to owners. A timeline for Tesla’s eventual network is unclear, and something investors will be hoping Musk elaborates on Thursday. JPMorgan (JPM) analysts in June said they don’t expect material revenue generation for years to come. Guggenheim Securities’ Ronald Jewsikow told Yahoo Finance on Monday that a “real credible path to robotaxi commercialization in the next 12 to 24 months is extremely unlikely.” Ark Investment Management has forecast a scenario where robotaxis account for 90% of Tesla’s value by 2029, pushing the stock to as much as $3,100 per share. If a network isn’t operational by that year, its price target would fall to about $350 per share. Ark CEO Cathie Wood earlier this week said she thinks analysts will have to positively revise their estimates for the robotaxi’s effect on Tesla’s profits, telling Yahoo Finance she expects 80% gross margins. “This is not if, it is when for Tesla. And for Tesla, it’s also how quickly will they roll out?” Woods said. “How quickly will they go national, or even global, with their aspirations?” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other AI data center stocks. The AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem. AI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. While AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%. The AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.

Astera Labs (ALAB) shares jumped Wednesday after the Nvidia (NVDA) supplier announced new products to support artificial intelligence (AI). The company introduced two new fabric switches that Nvidia Senior VP of GPU Engineering Brian Kelleher said will support the chipmaker's AI infrastructure "across a wide variety of AI and [high-performance computing] workloads." Astera, which went public in March, said in its initial public offering (IPO) filing that its customers include several key players in the AI space such as Nvidia, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Jefferies analysts said the new products could help Astera diversify its offerings and expand the market for its products. The analysts held a "buy" rating for the stock, with a price target of $65, about 6% above Wednesday's closing price of $61.22. Astera Labs shares surged over 15% Wednesday, and have gained about 70% from their IPO price in March.

Title: Indigenous groups in Brazil: We were not consulted on carbon credits

Thursday, 10 Oct 2024 FILE PHOTO: Indigenous leader Alessandra Korap Munduruku takes part in a protest for land demarcation and against President Jair Bolsonaro's government, in Brasilia, Brazil June 16, 2021. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/File Photo BRASILIA (Reuters) - Indigenous organizations in the Brazilian state of Para said they were not consulted by the government before it signed a deal with multinational companies to sell carbon offset credits to support conservation of the Amazon rainforest in the state. Amazon.com Inc and other firms agreed last month to buy carbon credits valued at $180 million through the LEAF Coalition conservation initiative, which it helped set up in 2021 with a group of companies and governments, including the United States and United Kingdom. At the time, Para Governor Helder Barbalho said the deal had the participation of Indigenous peoples and traditional communities. But on Tuesday, 38 Indigenous and community organizations from Para signed a public letter denouncing his failure to consult them. "It is unacceptable for the government of Pará to take decisions without consulting traditional communities, who are the greatest protectors of the forests while also being the most impacted by the lack of effective climate adaptation policies," they said in the letter. "Forest peoples must be heard and consulted. Our territories are not for sale," they said. Alessandra Korap Munduruku, a tribal leader who was the letter's principal author, said the role of U.S.-based companies like Amazon and Walmart in the carbon credit purchase was worrying, as well as that of asset manager BlackRock, which she said had a destructive footprint in her region. "Our priority is the eviction of invaders on our reservation lands that are threatened by miners and a grain railway," she told Reuters by telephone. "Our leaders were never consulted on the carbon credits. We are being sold like goods." The governor's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Korap Munduruku is an Indigenous teacher turned community leader who won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2023 for her efforts to convince mining companies leave Munduruku lands. The agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb. The deal foresees the purchase of up to 12 million tons of carbon credits generated by reducing deforestation in Para between 2023 and 2026. It was announced on Sept. 24 during New York Climate Week. Each of the credits represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions and they are jurisdictional, so Pará gets paid for reducing deforestation across the state, including on public lands like reservations. Governor Barbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples and traditional communities as well as family farms. Para will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.

Title: Ethereum dominance struggles at 13% – What’s going on?

Several factors have spurred Ethereum’s declining dominance and its underperformance against Bitcoin. Ethereum [ETH] has been underperforming against Bitcoin [BTC] over the past year. For instance, Bitcoin has gained more than 120% year-on-year (YoY), while Ethereum has gained around 50%. Ethereum’s underperformance has seen its market dominance tank to range lows. At press time, it stood at 13.85%, a notable drop from a yearly high of nearly 20%. Source: TradingView Several factors have spurred the declining dominance of the largest altcoin, and its underperformance against Bitcoin. Bitcoin has witnessed a significant increase in dominance this year. This metric has been forming higher highs and moving within an ascending channel since the start of the year. Source: TradingView One key factor triggering a rise in Bitcoin’s dominance is the high demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold more than $57 billion worth of BTC. This shows high institutional interest that is fuelling positive price performance. The other factor causing a drop in Ethereum dominance is whale selling activity. On the 8th of October, a large address that participated in the 2014 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) deposited 5,000 ETH to Kraken, valued at $12M. This whale has deposited around 50,000 ETH valued at $125M to exchanges in the last two weeks per SpotOnChain. The Ethereum Foundation, which has also been on a selling spree, has contributed to Ethereum’s underperformance. Since the beginning of the year, this institution has sold more than $10M worth of ETH. An uptick in whale selling activity without a rise in demand could see ETH continue trading rangebound if new buyers fail to enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has recorded low demand for its spot ETFs. Data from CryptoQuant shows that since these ETFs launched in July, they have recorded $849M in outflows. Source: CryptoQuant The outflows have been spurred by the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The ETFs are also struggling with a lack of new inflows. The BlackRock spot ETH ETF has posted zero inflows in the last two days. At the same time, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund has not seen any positive flows this month according to SoSoValue. This weak demand has failed to drive gains for Ethereum, which has further contributed to a decline in dominance. Ethereum is also struggling with a declining burn rate as the coin turns inflationary. Data from Ultrasound Money shows that in the last 30 days, more than 43,000 ETH tokens were added to the circulating supply. Data from Santiment shows that Ethereum’s annual inflation rate recently reached 18%, the highest level since August. Source: Santiment Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The lack of fresh demand to absorb this rising supply is bound to increase sell-side pressure on Ethereum causing it to lose its market share to Bitcoin and other altcoins. Ethereum’s falling dominance has also contributed to weakening market sentiment. Per Market Prophit, most traders are bearish on Ethereum while smart money or institutions remain bullish.

Title: Teenager had fingers broken during assault by group of youths in south Dublin, court hears

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A GROUP OF youths who broke a teenager’s fingers in south county Dublin told him not to mess with lads from their school again, a court has heard. One of the group of perpetrators, Luke Daly (23), has had his sentence deferred after he pleaded guilty to simple assault at Rock Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 7 December 2019. Daly, of Booterstown Avenue, Booterstown, Co Dublin, was one of ten or 20 youths who set upon the victim in what a judge said “may have been a case of mistaken identity”. Daly admitted grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him to the ground, however, gardaí could not say that he had any role in kicking or hitting. The victim suffered three fractured fingers when he was kicked by some of the youths as he went to get the DART home after attending a house party. At Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, Daly was ordered to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pending sentence next April. Judge Orla Crowe said the offence would warrant a sentence of two months, but that she intended to dispose of the case under Section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act. Daly was also ordered to pay the victim the sum of €3,000, which he had offered as a token of his remorse. Judge Crowe said the victim in the case was “entirely innocent and blameless” and simply should not have been subject to attack. Garda Eoin O’Mahony told Alison Fynes BL, prosecuting, that the victim went to a house party in Booterstown on the night, then left with some friends and his girlfriend to go to Domino’s Pizza. The victim told gardaí that shortly after 11pm, he was walking his girlfriend and two other friends towards the DART station, when he saw a group of ten or 20 lads walking behind them. Some of the group grabbed his friend, saying: “Can we have a chat?” and then pulled him to the ground. The victim said he ran to help his friend and then a lad ran after him, pulled him to the ground and a group began kicking him in the ribs. He asked them were they done and they replied: “Don’t mess with lads from (a particular school).” The victim’s friends gave similar statements, describing the large group as saying “You won’t mess with (a named school) again.” Advertisement The court heard there had been an altercation earlier on at a house party which did not involve either the victim or his friends. Daly was arrested and admitted to grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him down. He told gardaí pushes were exchanged and that the victim was on the ground when he left. The court heard that the large group of males had incorrectly assumed that the victim and his friend were part of a rival school. Daly had just turned 18 at the time, while the rest of the group of perpetrators were all underage. One of the other members of the group was assigned a Garda Junior Liaison Officer but no-one else was identified or prosecuted. The victim did not wish to attend court or make a victim impact statement, the court heard. Daly pleaded early at the District Court to the charge of simple assault, but the court referred the matter to the Circuit Court. Daly has no previous convictions and has not come to garda attention since, the court heard. Kevin Roche BL, defending, said it was an extremely childish incident which got out of control and was entirely out-of-character for his client. Counsel said this case has hung over Daly throughout his undergraduate degree and the Master’s degree he is currently doing. Daly, whose parents were present in court, was described as pro-social. The court heard that Daly has been putting money aside from part-time work and had brought the sum of €3,000 to court by way of compensation. Judge Crowe said it had been a “grave misunderstanding” and may have been a case of mistaken identity. The judge noted the large number of testimonials on Daly’s behalf and described him as a person of considerable academic and musical talent. “He has not come to any adverse attention since and has devoted his life to study. This was manifestly out-of-character. Gardaí have no concerns about this man,” added the judge. Daly is due back before court on 10 March 2025 for mention and final orders will be made on 10 April, when the case will be disposed of, if Daly has met all conditions.

Title: MicroStrategy Is a Strategic Buy to Capitalize on Bitcoin’s Outperformance
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-strategic-buy-capitalize-bitcoin-174706028.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:47:06Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a tech company that has spent the last few years accumulating Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet through a well-executed financing strategy. This approach supports my bullish stance on the company, particularly in a rising crypto market. MSTR has outperformed Bitcoin, highlighting the advantages of holding the company’s stock over directly investing in the cryptocurrency. By investing in MSTR, investors can amplify Bitcoin’s potential returns through a regulated stock, making it a more accessible option for institutional investors compared to holding cryptocurrency directly. Specifically, this year, MSTR shares have benefited from their high correlation with Bitcoin’s price swings, rallying over 211%. Recently, the shares saw an increase in momentum following the Fed’s interest rate cut. The last time this occurred, Bitcoin’s price more than doubled. In this article, I will delve into the strategy behind MicroStrategy’s business and explain why buying at current levels may be a wise decision. Before delving further into the bullish thesis, it’s essential to provide some context. MicroStrategy is (or was) primarily a data software company that helps customers make informed decisions by analyzing large sets of data from multiple sources. However, facing strong competition from powerful players like Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM), its core business has struggled to grow. About four years ago, the company pivoted to make aggressive investments in Bitcoin, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor, a staunch advocate of cryptocurrency. According to MicroStrategy’s shareholder letter released last year, the company holds an unwavering confidence in Bitcoin for the long term. The management team stated, “Because of its characteristics, we believe Bitcoin is a superior store of value, akin to digital gold or digital property. Just as records and CDs gave way to digital music, we believe gold and other traditional physical stores of value will give way to Bitcoin.” Currently, about 38% of MicroStrategy’s market cap corresponds to its Bitcoin holdings. By the end of July, MicroStrategy owned 226,500 Bitcoins, purchased at a total cost of $8.3 billion, and now valued at about $14.3 billion. The main bullish argument for MicroStrategy centers on its clever strategy of expanding its balance sheet through Bitcoin acquisitions. Since 2020, CEO Michael Saylor has focused on growing MicroStrategy’s value by buying Bitcoin with debt, particularly through convertible bonds, and capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s high volatility. As the price of Bitcoin rises, the company is able to borrow even more money and add to its crypto holdings. At the same time, the company generates revenue from its software business, which amounted to $111 million in Q2, the most recent quarter. However, this represents a slowdown compared to the $120 million generated during the same period last year. As a result, over the past five years, MicroStrategy’s shares have appreciated by nearly 1,200%, closely mirroring fluctuations in Bitcoin prices. However, the journey has not always been smooth. A few years ago, high inflation and rising interest rates made it more expensive for the company to issue new debt or rollover existing obligations. During the crypto winter, from early 2021 to early 2023, MSTR shares plummeted by as much as 86%, falling to less than $15 per share. Today, however, shares have rebounded and exceed $185. My Buy stance on MicroStrategy extends to the belief that purchasing MicroStrategy stock may be more advantageous than buying the cryptocurrency or investing in a BTC fund. At first glance, it may seem illogical to pay a premium on MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV) in Bitcoin, which currently exceeds 2.3x. This premium reflects how much more or less the market values the company’s stock compared to its Bitcoin holdings alone, especially when you could simply buy the cryptocurrency directly. However, MicroStrategy’s primary advantage lies in its ability to capitalize on and acquire more Bitcoin. So far this year, the company issued two convertible debt offerings at less than 1% in March, scaled up its convertible note offering in June, and conducted another offering more recently in September, using the proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin. This ability to raise capital is one of the main justifications cited by Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer, who notes that the company has timed the market extraordinarily well. In fact, MicroStrategy’s stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin since it began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY), NASDAQ (QQQ), gold (GLD), silver (SLV), and major tech stocks. Palmer concludes that, particularly in a bull market, the premium on MicroStrategy shares is justified, and I tend to agree. The Wall Street consensus on MSTR stock is exceptionally optimistic. All eight analysts covering the stock recommend buying it, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus. The average price target is $202.25, indicating a potential upside of 2.93% based on the latest share price. In summary, I believe that during crypto bull markets, investors who are bullish on Bitcoin should consider a position in MicroStrategy. This approach makes sense because MicroStrategy’s use of debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings has been effectively executed, potentially leading to outperformance relative to both the market and the currency itself. Therefore, I view MicroStrategy as a Buy.

This is the August 29th issue of the ForbesBLK newsletter, dedicated to elevating and empowering the world’s top Black entrepreneurs, leaders and investors. Delivered every Thursday straight to your inbox, it’s a must-read for those looking to stay inspired. Click here to get on the newsletter list! Hey ForbesBLK, Ayisha Mendez here. Did you know that Black women are the fastest growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the United States? Out of the 2.7 million businesses nationwide, 61% are self-funded, according to the Harvard Business Review. This is largely due to the lack of access to capital, exacerbated by the fact that less than 1% of venture capital dollars go to female founders. One ForbesBLK community member taking this head on is Genever Oppong, a private equity associate at BlackRock. She has witnessed firsthand the transformative effects of directing capital toward under-resourced communities of color. And emphasized that, “Together, we can shine a spotlight on the intersection of capital and community, showcasing how strategic investments in Black founders and investors can lead to transformative outcomes.” For Black Business Month, we did just that by joining forces with Genever’s network of Black Women Investors (BWI) and Tonna Obaze from Tonna&Co, for the State of Capital event aimed at providing strategies to access capital. This gathering brought together Black founders and funders to demystify venture capital and discuss equitable pathways to funding. During the event, panelist Stephany Ohaz, a Nigerian-American Investor whose pursuit of “finance for good” led her to impact investing, shared insights on how capital can be used as an agent of change. One of those impact recipients is Abena Boamah-Acheampong, founder of Hanahana Beauty, known as the, “Skincare Entrepreneur (Who) Is Giving Her Customers Equity In The Brand.” Her advice for those seeking capital is to, “look for people who have aligned incentives with you” and to prioritize building a supportive community – not just within your consumer base but also among those who can foster your growth. State of Black Capital by Marvin Lloyd “It’s also possible that VC funding is not the right fit for your business... and that’s OK,” explained Wilglory Tanjong, founder Amina Iris, known for its “Beyonce-approved” bags. During a live workshop led by Atlanta entrepreneur and local advisor, Yaminah Childress, members explored alternative ways to secure capital through the grant writing process. Events like this highlight the vital role community, training and networking play in fostering financial empowerment and establishing strategies for advancing capital.

Title: Nvidia wants to drive AI costs down as 'reasoning' models rise
URL: https://qz.com/jensen-huang-nvidia-ai-innovation-faster-chips-podcast-1851668840
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:15:43Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips have been a driver of the current artificial intelligence boom — and the chipmaker only wants to make it move faster, chief executive Jensen Huang said. During an appearance on the Tech Unheard podcast, Huang was asked by host Rene Haas, chief executive of British semiconductor company Arm (ARM), if the pace of AI innovation is moving “faster than you imagined.” Huang replied, “No,” and said Nvidia is “trying to make it go faster.” “We’ve gone to a one-year cycle,” Huang said about the company’s production of new chips. “And the reason for that is because the technology has the opportunity to move fast.” Nvidia is designing “six or seven new chips per system,” Huang said, then using “co-design to reinvent the entire system” and inventing other technologies that allow it to improve performance by two or three times while using the same amount of energy and cost each year. “That’s another way of, essentially, reducing the cost of AI by two or three times per year,” Huang said. “That is way faster than Moore’s Law.” Over the next few years, Huang said, Nvidia wants to drive down the cost of AI amid the rise of even more complex models. This evolution is already underway. In September, OpenAI released a new series of “reasoning” AI models called o1, which are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond,” the way humans do. In the future, AI services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which Huang said he uses every day, will “iteratively reason about the answer” and could go through hundreds or thousands of inferences before producing an output. This level of complex processing would require significantly more computational power than current models. Despite the increased demands, Huang believes the trade-off is worthwhile. “[T]he quality of the answer is so much better,” Huang said. “We want to drive the cost down so that we could deliver this new type of reasoning inference with the same level of cost and responsiveness as the past.” On Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock was climbing back toward its record high $135 close in June. The chipmaker’s shares were down 0.27% during midday trading, but opened up almost 1% at around $134 per share.

Title: Hedera Analyst Thinks HBAR Will Easily 30X After Sinking 70% In 6 Months
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/hedera-hbar-30x-sinking-70-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:00:15Z
Full Content:
Hedera, a proof-of-stake platform, wasn’t spared from aggressive bears in early October. After HBAR, its native token, floated higher in September, the rejection of bulls in early October resulted in a double top. Overall, there is optimism that bulls will resume and push prices to new Q4 2024 highs. The pace of this growth will depend on how the market performs and whether fundamental factors around the project will prop up buyers. While there are cracks in the HBAR price action, considering the dump from April highs of around $0.18, one analyst on X thinks the token is set for major gains. From his assessment, Hedera can easily score 30X in the coming sessions, mirroring the gains posted by Cardano in the last cycle. Then, ADA soared by over 170X. If HBAR is to follow the same path, the token can easily soar to $6, over 60X from its 2024 highs. Presently, technical candlestick arrangements favor sellers. After the rally to $0.18 in April 2024, HBAR has been falling. To put the numbers into perspective, the token is down 70% but is stable after finding support in August and September. The local resistance is the double top at around September highs. If prices break above this liquidation zone, HBAR bulls could embark on the journey to drive the coin to $0.18. In effect, this will resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. There are fundamental factors to consider that may propel HBAR, helping the token shake off weaknesses. Early this month, Canary Capital released the first United States HBAR Trust. Like Grayscale products, including the ETHE and GBTC, the HBAR Trust allows institutional investors to gain exposure to HBAR. Accordingly, this could drive demand, lifting prices. In September, Hedera launched the Asset Tokenization studio. Through this solution, the network would be at the forefront of driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) while adhering to existing laws. Already, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, believes tokenization will rapidly grow in the coming years, managing trillions. According to rwa.xyz, over $12.7 billion worth of RWAs has been tokenized. Additionally, there is interest. In the last month alone, the number of RWA holders rose to 68,929, a 4% increase. Most of these assets are tokenized on Ethereum and Stellar. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Title: Reddit Stock Rises as Jefferies Calls Stock a 'Buy' on AI Strengths
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/reddit-stock-rises-as-jefferies-calls-stock-a-buy-on-ai-strengths-8725540
Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:57:54Z
Full Content:
Reddit (RDDT) shares climbed Wednesday after analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of the social media platform with a "buy" rating, citing its success within Google search results and its artificial intelligence (AI) use cases. The firm issued a price target of $90 per share, a 27% premium over Tuesday's closing price and well above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. Reddit's user growth accelerated to 51% in the second quarter, the firm noted, its highest level in four years. A big reason for that is the success of a revamped web platform the company debuted last year, which has led to "deeper integration into Google search." The company's average revenue per user is actually well below rivals Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP), which suggests a "long runway for increased monetization," analysts said. Reddit’s large library of user posts are a valuable resource for companies developing generative AI models, Jefferies said. The company has established about $325 million in contract licensing revenue over the next three years, led by deals with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and OpenAI. Going forward, the firm suggested that partnerships with companies such as Amazon (AMZN) and Anthropic could be in the cards, which would mean more high-margin revenue streams. Shares of Reddit climbed about 2% intraday Wednesday and are up about 43% since the company's IPO in March.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock is aiming for a new all-time high close as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom. The stock traded flat midday Wednesday at $133. It previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. Nvidia stock notched its fifth consecutive day of gains Tuesday, rising 4% to $132.89. Shares are up 12% from last week. The stock’s climb has been fueled by a barrage of good news for the company. Wall Street analysts this week have reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs “remains extremely robust.” A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia’s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday. Nvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan’s largest supercomputer during Foxconn’s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it’s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia’s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions. Nvidia’s weeklong ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. Shares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China, due to rising trade tensions with the US, had also driven shares down. Nvidia’s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June. Other positive news in the semiconductor sector Wednesday could help Nvidia stock achieve a new record close. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations — another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term. “AI is hot,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, “I see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.” The chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech’s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown. Semiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia’s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that it’s boosting capacity to meet “crazy” demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs (graphics processing units). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips has been “insane.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Make your PS5 setup "pro", with or without the upgraded console When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As someone who reviews all sorts of PS5 accessories for a living, I would argue you can make a PS5 Pro setup without buying Sony's new $699 console. Sure, a new GPU that can use AI upscaling and generally fling better graphics at your display is nice, but I'd argue that quality-of-life updates through upgrading other parts of your gaming setup will make much more of a difference to you. Of course, with Prime Day PS5 deals going on at the same time as PS5 pre-orders, now is a great time to shop for either a new console or some new gaming hardware and accessories. Since I've been keeping tabs on both of these things, I thought it would be a great opportunity to sift through the digital storefronts, finding the very best PS5 accessories and upgrades. Now, I totally appreciate that if you bought all of the products in the list below, you'd probably run your bank account through the wringer, and at that point, you may even spend more than you would on a PS5 Pro. I've put together the list below because barring the TV I've picked out, I've had hands-on time with every single thing, and can attest to each one making a massive difference to my gaming time. Without further ado, here are the Prime Day deals I'd use to make a dream PS5 Pro setup. SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P | $179.99 $109 at Amazon Save $70 - I use this headset every time I boot up the PS5, and you can get it here at its lowest-ever price. It as previously down to $125 in September, but this extra discount makes it particularly tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want exceptional sound quality ✅ You want a simultaneous Bluetooth connection ✅ You don't use the USB-C port on your console for anything else. Don't buy it if: ❌ You want a wireless mixer Price check: Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £137.74 at Amazon If you sift through enough of my ramblings about gaming tech, you'll know that audio means a great deal to me when gaming. I'm a huge lover of video game soundtracks, and I also play a lot of Hunt: Showdown, a game where audio is paramount to success. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P is a great headset above all, conveying sound cues accurately and balancing the varying tones of soundtracks beautifully. The other reason I love this headset though, and would recommend it at this price, is because it has simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity. That means that while your headset is connected to the PS5 or a PC through the wireless USB-C dongle, you can also connect your phone to it through Bluetooth. When you're scrolling through your phone while a game loads or you're taking a break, the audio will come through your headset at the same time. It's a huge quality-of-life feature I now don't want to go without. Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB | $99.99 $84.99 at Amazon Save $15 - If a storage upgrade would be more beneficial, this 1TB drive is the deal I'd make the most of this Prime Day. For being one of the best drives on the market, this really is a great price to pay. Buy it if: ✅ You want a top-performing SSD ✅ You need more storage space ✅ You'd like something that's simple to install Don't buy it if: ❌ You've pre-ordered the PS5 Pro Price check: Walmart: $84.99 UK: £97.99 at Amazon The PS5 Pro comes with a 2TB internal drive, which is nice, but it seems a bit pointless to me. The best SSDs for PS5 already exist, and you can usually find another 1TB drive to slot into an existing console without spending $100. The Corsair MP600 Elite is one of the first drives I'd recommend to PS5 owners this year. It outperforms the majority of other compatible options for this console, and it has one of the best integrated heatsinks I've come across. As true as that is, you can still get it for the price of the budget brands, thanks to this deal. If you just want an extra terabyte of space so you don't need to keep deleting games, this is the one I'd point you toward. If you want some serious future-proofing, on the other hand, check out the drive below. Samsung 990 Pro 4TB | $479.99 $265.99 at Amazon Save over $200 - Over $200 is a lot of money to spend on a small accessory for PS5. However, 4TB of space will last you for years to come, even if you download pretty much everything that gets added to PlayStation Plus every month. I've never seen this drive so cheap, so it's an amazing time to buy. Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade your storage ✅ You genuinely need 4TB ✅ You want the best SSD going Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't care about read/write speeds UK: £284.18 at Amazon The 4TB Samsung 990 Pro is the drive I use in my own console, and yes, it is arguably overkill. Still, its probably the best performing SSD out there at the moment. It's certainly the best one you can get for the PS5 because of its relentless speed. The majority of people don't actually need 4TB, but if you're building the setup of dreams, that will usually involve never needing to upgrade again. PSVR 2 | $549 $494.99 at Walmart Save $100 - I wasn't sure we'd see PSVR 2 get more price cuts this year after a big Days of Play discount brought it down by $100 during the summer. This is a really nice way to get it a bit cheaper if you missed that price though. Buy it if: ✅ You like VR gaming ✅ You have a gaming PC or PS5 ✅ You have the space to use it Don't buy it if: ❌ VR gaming makes you feel unwell Price check: Amazon: $529 | Best Buy: $549.99 UK: £495 at Amazon PSVR 2 is one of my favorite bits of gaming hardware. I know it isn't exactly a cheap upgrade for an existing PS5 owner, but it is probably one of the best ways to enjoy your console. VR gaming isn't for everyone, but this is arguably one of the best things about the PS5 because it adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to a platform that's struggled to put out first-party titles consistently. If you're at all interested in making the perfect PS5 setup, the best VR headset on the market right now has to be on your radar. GameSir G8 Galileo | $79.99 $61.59 at Amazon Save $18 - This mobile controller is more comfortable and more useful than a Backbone one. It also costs less money - especially in this deal. I'd recommend it any day of the week, but with an $18 reduction, it's even more tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want to play PS5 Remote Play ✅ You have larger hands ✅ You want back buttons Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't have a USB-C phone UK: £59.99 at Amazon The GameSir G8 Galileo is the best mobile controller right now, and it'll save you a lot more money than if you were to buy the PlayStation Portal. I'm not sure it should be able to, but the G8 can be used for PS5 Remote Play, which is incredible for a non-officially licensed controller. If you ever take your gaming sessions on the go, the GameSir G8 Galileo is the best PS controller you had no idea existed. Victrix Pro BFG wireless controller in white | $179.99 $154.99 at Amazon Save $35 - A 20% discount is exclusive to the white colorway of this controller, but it's a total steal if you're looking for an amazingly versatile PS5 controller. Buy it if: ✅ You want extra customization options ✅ You like to swap your components around ✅ You also want a controller for PC Don't buy it if: ❌ You won't make the most of the extras Price check: Walmart: $158.49 | Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £127.39 at Amazon This is, by far and away, the best PS5 controller on the shelves right now. It's cheaper, more versatile, and offers so much more utility than any of its rivals. If you want "pro" level gameplay, a controller like this is your key to unlocking it. If you take any game seriously enough to get "sweaty" about online leaderboards, or you even want to improve your K/D ratio in a casual shooter, this gamepad will make it so much easier for you. The Victrix Pro BFG has a modular design, meaning those facial parts? They can be pulled out and flipped upside down, which puts to bed that old debate about whether offset or symmetrical thumbstick layouts are better. Enjoy what you like, and change it around depending on the game you play - the BFG will let you do whatever you like. LG OLED C4 48-inch | $1,599.99 $996.99 at Amazon Save $203 - The LG OLED C4 is one of the best gaming TVs of the year, and if you go for a smaller size, you can get it under a grand right now. These are highly coveted screens, so if you can find one discounted, don't wait around. Buy it if: ✅You want one of the latest OLED TVs ✅You need faster 120Hz visuals ✅You prioritise contrast and color Don't buy it if: ❌You’d rather find a C3 for less ❌You want a brighter mini-LED model Other available sizes: 📺42-inch - $1,096.99 $896.99 at Amazon 📺55-inch - $1,999.99 $1,296.99 at Amazon 📺65-inch - $2,699.99 $1,496.99 at Amazon 📺77-inch - $3,699.99 $2,496.99 at Amazon 📺83-inch - $5,399.99 $3.996.39 at Amazon Last, but certainly not least, is the TV I would be buying today if I didn't have a car to finish paying off. The LG OLED C4 is the latest in a long line of best gaming TV models produced by the brand. For years I've been envious of my older cousin who has had these TVs. Beyond going for silly money G Series OLEDs from LG, this is the perfect display for PS5 or PS5 Pro. 120Hz refresh rates can boost games to much smoother performance levels, 4x HDMI 2.1 ports mean you never need to swap out cables again, and a solid processor and OS make it a responsive Smart TV for viewing other content. I could honestly gush about these TVs all day long, but I don't want to delay you from buying if you can afford one, because these things go out of stock fast. While they're around, make the most of Prime Day gaming deals, Prime Day PC deals, and Prime Day Meta Quest deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote Forget the Nintendo Alarmo, my bedside clock is an adorable Zelda handheld that's half the price Psst, I've got a 1.5TB microSD deal for Steam Deck players who slept on Prime Day Valve reminds Steam users they don't actually own a darn thing they buy, GOG pounces and says its games "cannot be taken away from you" thanks to offline installers GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, said there’s been a surge in active Bitcoin addresses—up by 39% over the past week. That signals increased demand and liquidity, he said. Otychenko also noted a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM). NVM measures the relationship between Bitcoin's market value and the activity on its network, indicating potential under- or overvaluation. And now, the Bitcoin NVM is at levels not seen since its all-time high—suggesting the cryptocurrency could be trading below its intrinsic value. "Historically, when active addresses surge like this, it often precedes or accompanies price increases," Otychenko told Decrypt. The NVM metric has been a reliable indicator in the past, as it did in late 2022 and September 2023, when BTC saw price recoveries following similar drops in NVM, he added. Currently, Bitcoin is trading down 0.6% at $62,120, struggling to maintain levels above key technical indicators. It remains sandwiched between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA, a situation that mirrors price action from October 2023. For the cryptocurrency to break out of this consolidation, a move above the 200-day SMA with higher trading volume is essential. "Bitcoin needs to push above the 200-day SMA and sustain those levels to see further upward momentum," Otychenko said. However, the gains over the past week have come with decreasing volume, suggesting a lack of strong bullish momentum. On a broader level, analysts like Brian Dixon, CEO of OTC Capital, are rethinking Bitcoin’s traditional characterization as a purely risk-on asset. "Recent analyses, including from major financial institutions like BlackRock, are challenging the view of Bitcoin as only a risk asset," Dixon told Decrypt. He highlighted the evolving narrative of BTC behaving more like gold during economic downturns, pointing to its potential role as a risk-differentiated or even risk-off asset. This shift could redefine Bitcoin’s position in investment portfolios, making it a more attractive option for long-term diversification. "Bitcoin might offer protection against market volatility in ways that traditional assets might not," Dixon added, furthering the case for its adoption as a hedge against traditional market downturns. In terms of institutional flows, Bitcoin ETFs have seen mixed results. On Tuesday, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $18.6 million, with the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) leading the outflows at $48.8 million. However, the BlackRock ETF (IBIT) saw an inflow of $39.5 million on the same day. Spot ETFs that track Ethereum, which has remained relatively stable, saw a total net outflow of $8.1 million from spot ETFs on October 8, data from SoSo Value shows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price BTC was trading down 0.6% at $62,050 and Ether is trading flat at $2,432, according to data from CoinGecko. BTC's immediate price action remains contingent on upcoming macroeconomic data. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, noted that the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data could serve as triggers for Bitcoin’s next move. "Potential triggers to break out of this range could be Fed minutes or U.S. inflation data if they lead to a reassessment of expectations in traditional markets," Kuptsikevich said, in a note to Decrypt.

Title: The 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover 11 Best States to Retire and Offset this Gap

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2024 7:58:39 AM PDT by Red Badger This article looks at the 2025 Social Security COLA falls short: discover 11 best states to retire and offset the gap. You may skip our detailed analysis and jump to 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover the 5 Best States to Retire and Offset the Gap. 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal.

With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11.

Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years.

The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8.

Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite.

With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7.

All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia.

Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN).

The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination.

South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1.

Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years.

Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US.

There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons.

Title: Nvidia's stock is breaking out, Fairlead Strategies says

AI behemoth NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is breaking out and could be heading to its June high of around $141 per share, according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. "Heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) confirmed a triangle breakout yesterday, supporting near-term follow-through toward its June high (~$141)," Stockton said. "While the SPX and NDX have seen short-term momentum weaken, NVDA’s breakout is likely to prevent a major pullback in the major indices, which is part of the reason why we keep a short-term neutral bias for U.S. equities in today's Fairlead Tactics." NVIDIA stock has been up six straight sessions, including today's fractional gain of 0.12%. The stock is up more than 170% year-to-date. Analysts have been increasingly bullish on the company's Blackwell product, which the CEO Jensen Huang said is seeing "insane" demand. "Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and demand for Blackwell is insane," Huang said on CNBC's last week. "Everyone wants the most, and everyone wants to be first." Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported that September sales beat estimates on solid AI chip demand. TSM said revenue for September 2024 was approximately NT$251.87 billion, an increase of 0.4 percent from August 2024 and an increase of 39.6 percent from September 2023. TSM makes NVIDIA's AI chip. On Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley said Blackwell production revenue in 1Q25 may surpass Hopper. Blackwell chips command a price premium, with B200 chips priced 60-70% higher than H200, positioning Blackwell revenue to overtake Hopper in the upcoming quarter.

Title: 2 Big Dividends To Buy As Inflation Returns
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/10/09/2-big-dividends-to-buy-as-inflation-returns/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T14:43:00Z

Inflation Graphic to illustrate strong rising inflation. 3D illustration Another day, another sign the economy is heading straight for that “no-landing” scenario I’ve been talking about for weeks now … … and yet another sign the two dividends we’re going to discuss today are better buys than they’ve been in months. (One of these staunch payers kicks out a rich 8% divvie. The other has grown its dividend a ridiculous 425% in the last five years. A buy back then would be kicking out a sweet 6.2% dividend today, thanks to that breakneck growth!) When you hear “no landing,” your first impression might be that it sounds like a good thing, right? After all, it implies the economy will keep humming along, and that recession we’ve been worrying about since, well, 2020, will keep being pushed back. All good. Except here’s the rub: Inflation comes back. I mean, when you have a federal government spending nearly $2 trillion more than it’s taking in, it’s easy to see how this monetary inflation could seep into consumer price inflation. And there’s no way an extra $2 trillion dropping into the system isn’t going to juice the economy! No matter who wins the election, I think we can all agree that this spending is unlikely to be tamed. The opposite, in fact—fueling inflation even more. A quick look at the headlines brings more warnings of a potential resurgence of inflation: An expanding war in the Middle East, for example, has been pushing up oil prices. And even though the port workers’ strike has been settled, it reminds us how easily our supply chains can be disrupted. And of course we had last week’s blowout jobs report, which showed continued strong wage growth. Jay Powell seems to see this inflationary wave rolling in. Last week, he tamped down expectations of more jumbo rate cuts, like the 50-pointer the Fed dropped last month. Futures markets agree—they now point to just 75 basis points in cuts between now and the Fed’s last meeting of the year, on December 18. So where does that leave us? We’re looking to buy dividends that ride this growing economy while profiting from inflation’s return. That setup points straight to one sector: natural gas stocks. There are two other reasons to buy “natty” stocks now, too. First, there’s the massive stimulus plan China announced a little over a week ago. That’s likely to spur gas demand, as China is the biggest importer, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The other factor working in our favor is gas’s tendency to hit its $2 “price floor” and bounce—exactly what it’s doing now. A price that’s bottomed and has momentum? That’s typically a great time to buy. So let’s dive into those two dividends I mentioned off the top, starting with our 8% payer. At times like these, with energy prices still low but moving up, we look to the 8% dividend kicked out by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP Alerian MLP ETF ), which holds the shares of energy infrastructure companies. These firms—master limited partnerships (MLPs), to be exact—collect tolls on the oil and gas that moves through their lines and sits in their storage tanks. MLPs make money in all energy seasons, but it’s much better to own them when prices are at least steady or better yet rising, to snag price upside and sweet dividend payouts. When oil and gas prices (and shipping volumes) rise, the pipeline stocks AMLP owns boost their dividends. That’s resulted in a steady grind higher for the fund’s payout: AMLP Dividend Best of all, AMLP’s rising payout pulls its price up—a phenomenon I call the “Dividend Magnet.” The pattern is unmistakable: AMLP Dividend Magnet So where does that leave us? With an 8% “starter” yield that’s set to grow on a buy made today, as our “no-landing” setup pushes commodity demand (and prices) higher. Oh, and a share price poised to ride right along with it, too. By the way, buying MLPs through AMLP also eliminates one of the headaches of buying MLPs “direct”: complicated tax reporting. AMLP’s top holding, Plains All-American Pipeline LP (PAA), kicks you a fussy K-1 form at tax time, which is a hassle for you or the pro who files your taxes. (Trust me, I once got a firm talking-to from my accountant after buying MLPs a few years ago.) But buy through AMLP and voila, no K-1! Just a normal 1099 showing your dividends received. Which, of course, dishes that elite 8%. When natural gas is in the early stages of a rally, EQT Corp. (EQT) is my “go to” stock. The company boasts nearly 4,000 drilling locations—and the lowest breakeven costs in the industry. (Names hidden in the chart below to protect the less profitable!) FCF Breakeven The prices above indicate at what level the company’s gas is profitable to drill. Notice that EQT leads the pack overall. What’s more, the company is tightening its grip on the prolific Appalachian Basin through its recently completed $14-billion acquisition of Equitrans Midstream, its former midstream business, which adds 3,700 miles of pipeline, plus storage assets. EQT sees the move resulting in $425 million in cost savings (The firm also recently cut its workforce by 15%). It also nicely positions EQT as it moves to boost production after last winter no-showed in large parts of the country, hitting gas prices. Remember, too, that natural gas is the least offensive of the fossil fuels, which gives it long-term upside as a “transition” fuel as the world shifts toward renewables. NatGas Demand Growth Which brings us back to the Dividend Magnet. For months and even a few years, tickers can meander independently of their dividends. But eventually, they do follow their payouts higher like a puppy dog. EQT’s dividend has leaped above its stock, putting a strong pull on its price: EQT Dividend Magnet Even if I’m wrong with my “no-landing” call, all signs point to this one winning anyway. The stock is still well off its 2022 peak, its dividend is on a tear, and natgas production is about to ramp up, thanks in part to surging power demand from energy transition. That makes now a great time to buy EQT—and its charged-up Dividend Magnet. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are nearing their all-time highs Wednesday morning on positive news about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) products. Nvidia shares, which have ended higher the past five sessions, recently edged up to $133.30. Their all-time closing high is $135.58, achieved on June 18, and record intraday high is $140.76, recorded the following session two days later, after markets were closed for Juneteenth. On Tuesday, contract electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn reported strong demand for its servers powered by Nvidia's GB200 semiconductors, part of the latter's Blackwell architecture. Microsoft announced it was "the 1st cloud" running the Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. OpenAI also thanked Nvidia for delivering "one of the first engineering builds of the DGX B200 to our office." Also yesterday, Nvidia noted that the Blackwell platform has slashed energy consumption by up to 2,000 times over the last decade for AI training models such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Bob Pette, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's enterprise platforms, told participants at the company's AI Summit that "We are in the dawn of a new industrial revolution," adding that the firm is "designing our systems with not just performance in mind, but with energy efficiency in mind." Nvidia shares have soared about 170% this year. TradingView

September sales rose at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), with the chipmaker on Wednesday reporting numbers that pointed toward better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported September sales of 251.87 billion New Taiwan dollars ($7.82 billion), up just under 40% from the same time last year. Added to its results for August and July, TSMC reported NT$759.69 billion ($23.58 billion) in revenue for the third quarter, above the NT$749.88 billion analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had expected and roughly 36% above sales for the third quarter of 2023. The results surpassed TSMC's own outlook, as the company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expected third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company's US-traded shares were recently down more than 1% as broader markets wavered. The stock has risen steadily from August lows and is near record levels, up roughly 75% this year. The PHLX index of semiconductor shares edged lower Thursday. TSMC is set to report the rest of its third-quarter financial results on the morning of Oct. 17. The company surpassed estimates in the first two quarters of 2024, as demand for its chips to power AI technology have remained in high demand.

Nvidia stock seems to be climbing back to its record high close from June. The AI chipmaker’s stock was up almost 1% at the open on Wednesday, to about $134 per share. It later fell to about $133 per share. Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at almost $133 the day before. Nvidia’s rising stock has pushed its market capitalization past Microsoft’s (MSFT) again. During Wednesday morning trading, the chipmaker’s market cap reached $3.26 trillion, while Microsoft’s was $3.09 trillion. Both trailed Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.44 trillion. In June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back down, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings. In June, Nvidia’s shares closed at a record high $135.58, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split. Since then, its shares have experienced some turbulence, but the company’s stock is still up 173.4% so far this year. Compared to a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up 192%. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters. Compared to a year ago, TSMC’s revenue grew 36.5%, Reuters calculated. In July, the chipmaker said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $22.4 billion and 23.2 billion.

Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which supplies Nvidia and Apple with chips, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue of NT$759.7 billion, or $23.6 billion, for the September quarter, according to Reuters. Compared to a year ago, TSMC’s revenue grew 36.5%, Reuters calculated. In July, the chipmaker said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $22.4 billion and 23.2 billion.

On Wednesday, KeyBanc raised the stock price target for Pinterest Inc (NYSE: NYSE:PINS) to $45 from the previous $43, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. The adjustment follows the firm's assessment that Pinterest presents significant growth potential ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The company's favorable position is attributed to multiple factors. Foreign exchange rates are seen as increasingly beneficial, user engagement remains strong, and new product developments are on the horizon. One such development, Performance+, is expected to simplify campaign management on the platform. Drawing parallels to similar offerings from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), the analyst anticipates that Performance+ could spur sustained growth for Pinterest over the coming years. Despite challenges in the food and beverage sector, Pinterest is expected to overcome these as it moves past the comparative period in the fourth quarter. This year also marks the first holiday season where Pinterest will benefit from monetization efforts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. These initiatives, combined with a disciplined approach to expenses, are projected to result in at least 300 basis points of annual margin expansion. The firm's outlook is further bolstered by the current market valuation of Pinterest shares. With the stock trading at multiples of 15.6x and 12.2x the estimated enterprise value to EBITDA for 2025 and 2026, respectively, the analyst suggests that the market may be underestimating Pinterest's growth trajectory. In other recent news, Pinterest has been the subject of several analyst reviews. Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Pinterest, emphasizing the company's potential for high-teen growth rates and margin expansion. BofA Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on Pinterest shares, highlighting the company's ongoing integration of AI technology and its potential to achieve double-digit core growth by 2025. Deutsche Bank upgraded Pinterest's stock rating from Hold to Buy, citing the potential of its affluent user base and projected a 6% compound annual growth rate for Pinterest's global monthly active users with an 18% revenue growth over the next three years. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Pinterest with an Outperform rating, emphasizing the platform's unique position in the digital advertising space. The firm also noted Pinterest as the fastest-growing digital advertising platform. Baird reiterated an Outperform rating, focusing on the platform's potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. These are recent developments for Pinterest, a company that has also been working on expanding its operations. The third quarter of 2024 is expected to be the first complete quarter to reflect the revenue impact of the company's expansion efforts, which included the monetization of approximately 30 new countries through Google's platform. Pinterest's referral traffic from Amazon showed a notable increase in September, surging 148% year-over-year. The company's recent global advertising event, Pinterest Presents, showcased the platform's advancements and potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. Recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to KeyBanc's optimistic outlook on Pinterest. As of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, Pinterest's revenue grew by 16.22%, reaching $3.34 billion. This growth aligns with KeyBanc's expectations of significant potential for the company. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Pinterest's net income is expected to grow this year, supporting the analyst's projection of margin expansion. The company's strong financial position is further evidenced by the fact that it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, potentially providing flexibility for future investments in product development and growth initiatives. It is worth noting that while Pinterest is trading at a high P/E ratio of 115.63, it's also trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.71. This suggests that the market may indeed be undervaluing Pinterest's growth prospects, as KeyBanc pointed out. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Pinterest, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Liskov’s Gun: The parallel evolution of React and Web Components – Baldur Bjarnason

Full Content:
Web dev at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland Because this essay is over 11 000 words long(!) I’ve made a convenience EPUB file for offline reading. (EPUB only! No PDF this time.) You can download it over on the fulfilment service I use, Lemon Squeezy, with the option to pay what you want if you feel the urge to support my writing. Paying is absolutely optional. Unless you’re like me – an “extremely online” kind of web developer – you probably don’t notice the dramas and brouhahas that erupt in the web developer community with regularity. Most of the time these flame-wars offer little of value or less in terms of technical insight and the patter of angry voices fades away before it reaches the ears of the less online. But a recent one, which began when the maintainer of the SolidJS web development framework wrote a long and very angry-sounding blog post outlining why he didn’t think web components represented the future of web development, is a little bit less usual. Not because it has staying power. It’s fading away at the same steady pace as these things usually do. It’s interesting because it touches on what I think is a genuinely interesting technical issue, but in a way that pretty much forces every reader to ignore it. Normally, these “debates” are free of useful information. Often it’s somebody railing against this or that for largely personal reasons – I’ve certainly been guilty of that. Other times the points being made on both sides are largely innocuous. The people involved just seem to be using their “outside voices”, metaphorically speaking, for no particular reason. “You should write tests!” “Yes, but you need to do it properly! Otherwise, they just get in the way!” “I AGREE BUT I PHRASE IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME SOUND ANGRY AT YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE INTERNET AND I’M PROBABLY ANGRY AT SOMETHING!” It’s tiresome, especially because it’s common for this mode of debating to split people who are largely in agreement into groups that chalk each other up as assholes. The worst part being that both sides are generally true. Everybody involved had an asshole moment or two. What makes the web components debate interesting is that, this being the internet, many of the participants are behaving like assholes (though not you, dear reader, you’re one of the wonderful sensible few of the internet) while at the same time making interesting yet conflicting technical points. “These two groups seem to both be making solid technical points, and yet they end up disagreeing,” is always interesting. It means the topic has curious nuances and, possibly, unresolved hard questions. That bit is genuinely fun, at least if you’re of a personality type that finds unresolved hard questions fun. The tone and attitudes of some of the posts involved make it difficult, but discovering if there’s a “there” there can be worthwhile. But, because of the “everybody defaults to ‘asshole’” nature of social media, we often end up in a discourse archipelago where each island vehemently sticks to its opinions, never listening to the other, because most humans will resolutely ignore advice and observations if they come from somebody they consider to be an asshole. The core point of the current hubbub, if you dig through the rhetoric and follow the links back to earlier discussions and arguments is: It’s really hard to add extensibility and “composability” to an already complex class inheritance tree with pre-existing and rigidly defined composition system without making some hard compromises. But to get to that point, the point where we can dig into the technical details of the whys and wherefores, we first need to understand the context. We need to be able to look past the assholes to see the forest. We need to understand what somebody means when they say “web components”. If you aren’t directly involved in specific kinds of web development, you might not have a clear idea of what Web Components are. They are a set of web APIs that have been standardised and, for the most part, implemented by web browsers. They are a standard method for implementing and distributing reusable widgets. That’s pretty much it. There are a few features and details that surround these, help them integrate with other APIs, help smooth the edges, but this is Web Components. Together, these APIs let us build custom widgets that can be safely packaged into a custom element and will interoperate with pretty much anything that renders to a DOM, even React (though React specifically blocked custom elements for what honestly sounded like spurious reasons for the longest time and even now full support has only shipped in a beta release). Web Components aren’t what you would call a “disruptive” innovation, but they are genuinely useful. More so now they more reliably work with forms in modern browsers. They are a “hey, you know that thing browsers do? Well now you can do a little bit of that yourself” kind of extension mechanism. Slightly complicating the issue, the term tends to get reused across a few contexts. This last type of project is the one that’s of most interest to those in software development who might have to do some incidental web development. Because of how late Safari was to supporting form-associated custom elements, we’re only in the early stages of what Web Component Libraries can offer, but they have the potential to provide ready-made yet powerful and customisable widgets people could use when making websites, services, or web apps, no matter what client-side or server-side framework they’re using. Described this way, you might wonder how an otherwise innocuous set of web APIs, designed to aid in the making of reusable widgets, so consistently cause tension and conflict among web developers. So much so that it’s almost certainly a very bad idea for me to wade into it with this essay. Why do Web Components cause online web developer communities to erupt in anger and argument? To answer that, we need to go back over a decade, at least thirteen years, all the way back to 2011. The impression you’re likely to get from discussions online would be that web components were created as a reaction to the rampant growth of React-based frameworks bloating websites and breaking accessibility. You couldn’t be faulted for thinking that web component APIs came about as a proposed fix. “Stop using React and use these APIs, they come with the web!” But web components not only predate the popular misuse of React and the rise of frameworks, they arguably predate React itself. Web components surfaced to public view in 2011 in a talk at the Fronteers conference by Alex Russell. These weren’t the web components you see today as the code he was presenting was a library, not a proposed standard – that would come later – but the shape of it is extremely familiar to those who have used modern Web Components. React at this point was still an internal project at Facebook and had only been in use for a few months, if that. These were two very different approaches towards creating dynamic web-based user interfaces, and they were as good as invented simultaneously. Their launch as public projects also happened at pretty much the same time with Google’s first attempt to standardise Web Components and Facebook’s first launch of React as an open source project both happening in 2013. This was, in my personal opinion, the point where multiple schisms in web development began to happen, the break that has hindered web developer discourse since. I should emphasise here that the following description of events is my opinion only and entirely based on what I saw as an outside observer. I was not privy to any private discussions or chats. I absolutely missed out on some important context, but I can say that this is what it looked like to a lot of people at the time. I appreciate that everybody involved meant well and had good reasons for their behaviour, but people will form their opinion of you based on what they know and see, which doesn’t include the stuff they don’t know about, and especially doesn’t include the stuff you haven’t made public. People do not read between the lines on the internet. At best, they make weird shit up and pretend it’s true. Web Components at this point were, and I know quite a few people will again disagree with me, an entirely proprietary Google project, much like React was an entirely proprietary Facebook project. Web components during these first three years, the first iteration that later got called “Web Components v0”, were only ever implemented by Google, only promoted by Google, and its biggest users were Google products and frameworks. The “polyfills”, itself a term that implies inevitable standardisation, were from the perspective of everybody not using Google’s Chrome the actual implementation of Web Components. They were slow as hell. This made the overall experience of Google properties that used them, such as YouTube, noticeably worse in Firefox. Not a great look, folks! To make matters worse – and, again, this is based on my impressions at the time and I know plenty of people disagree with me – a few of the more “enthusiastic” Web Components promoters during these three years were parading around being absolute assholes, to an even greater degree than seemed normal in online developer circles. Many of them seemed to outright believe that a set of APIs made unilaterally by a single vendor would inevitably get railroaded unchanged into a standard – in and of itself a highly problematic idea – and talked about web components being “the future”, implying that every other approach, no matter how new, was “legacy” or somesuch. Remember, React and Web Components were both released at around the same time – arguably React came later – and here these dudes (almost always dudes) were strutting around calling everything else outdated and obsolete. They claimed to be the only ones properly “using the platform”. Their approach was “standard”. A “standard” implemented by a single browser, pushed by a single company, with no interest from other browsers visible to an outside observer for at least three years. This is arguably normal behaviour in tech, where a dev-rel’s thankless task of building up good vibes about an API or platform can be tanked thoroughly by a lead dev opening their mouth and managing to simultaneously piss everybody off in 140 characters dumped onto the hive of seething malice that used to be called Twitter. But, because none of us saw what may or may not have been going on behind the scenes, and because Google was even then at the very least a proto-monopolist… This all? It was not a great look! It didn’t help that React was in full promise-the-world myth-making mode. It no longer really mattered whether Web Components were superior to React or not. Web developers largely focused on React, which has always had more competent PR than most other open source projects. Another problem was that nobody else seemed to agree with Google that this specific iteration of Web Components was the future. Firefox and Safari never implemented version “zero” of Web Components. Most developers favoured React’s approach to reactive programming and composition which, arguably, became the conceptual inspiration for pretty much every reactive component framework implemented since. Everybody who adopted this version of Web Components ended up getting punished for trusting Google. To say that the Safari and Firefox teams were sceptical about web components is oversimplifying things. The template element was relatively uncontroversial compared to the rest. “Autonomous” custom elements – the ability to define brand-new elements with custom names (<my-custom-element>) – were also relatively uncontroversial. The Shadow DOM and “built-in” custom elements – letting web developers directly modify native built-in elements in situ through sub-classing – proved much more divisive. Many at the time seemed convinced that this reticence was nothing more than a form of road-blocking, that these Mozilla and Apple employees were obeying some sort of secret directive from their bosses to “slow-walk” improvements to the web, but a much simpler explanation is that their concern was genuine, because there was a lot to be concerned about. These particular changes affect the core of how the Document Object Model (DOM) works. The consequences of doing the wrong thing would be both long-lasting and far-reaching, and the web has much too many footguns already. Messing around with the composition and inheritance models of the DOM is something you should legitimately be hesitant to do. Those arguing for ill intent do have their smoking gun: Apple’s unwillingness to ship the awesome that would be built-in custom elements is, to many, clear evidence that Apple hates the web. That the rationale for doing so involved citing something so clearly bullshit-sounding as the “Liskov Substitution Principle” has frequently been mocked by web devs on social media. (Don’t laugh. Many web devs also think “Model-View-Controller”, “Separation of Concerns”, and “unit testing” sound like bullshit. The web software industry has a substantial curiosity deficit. Apologies for the “X” links, but that’s where nonsense lives, retires, and dies of old age after an active life.) But, for the purposes of this story, Liskov’s a different kind of gun: Checkov’s gun. And I’m not just saying that because I think “Liskov” sounds a bit like “Checkov” and it amuses me to link the two. This gun will be fired in the third act and not in the way the “WebKit developers hate the web” types think. It turns out the Safari team had a point. Looking from the outside in, like that creepy dude in the “Sickos” cartoon, the discussions at the time looked involved and intense. The GitHub issue with the infamous “Liskov” remark I linked to above is over 500 comments long, and it’s one of many, not to mention mailing list threads and, I presume, a bunch of calls and in person conversations. But, eventually, browser vendors settled on a design for Web Components. This “v1” of Web Components was quite incompatible with “v0”, punishing everybody who took Google at their word that their proprietary v0 would eventually become a web standard: And a bunch more changes that I won’t go into here, but suffice to say migrating from v0 to v1 was a painful process for many. Moving an existing code base that used the entire Web Component v0 stack to v1 was non-trivial. It took YouTube itself a long while to migrate. Having to drop v0 and having to redesign Web Components to address the concerns raised by Safari and Firefox did not make the more avid in the Web Components crowd humble or change their tone. If anything, from the perspective of a regular web developer (me, that is), their rhetoric seemed to escalate now they could point to Web Components being an actual standard. If you are a masochist, you should easily be able to find GitHub comments or Tweets from this period, the early years of Web Components from 2016 to 2020, where a Google employee is calling all other approaches “legacy code” or “legacy approaches” or something similar. If you were a lurker at the time in the discussion threads between them and framework implementers, you’d have noticed that their advocacy also seemed to become much more targeted. The pressure was on those making the newer web development frameworks to build them using web components, not just be compatible with them, and it looked immense. The targets of this pressure were not Facebook’s React here, but newer frameworks such as Solid and Svelte. These are made by folks that, by and large, are very much in favour of using standards if possible, whereas the React folks seem more inclined to go “meh” and do their own thing. These newer frameworks are generally much better behaved when it comes to interoperability, exposing native DOM APIs, and performance. Both Solid and Svelte even compile to Web Components meaning you can use them to implement reusable custom elements for your projects. The problem? These pro-web maintainers have differing definitions of what’s “possible” from those more avidly promoting web components. Some of that comes from the fact that Web Components seem to be largely unsuitable to implementing a functional reactive component framework, which should not be surprising since the two concepts evolved in parallel, not in sequence. It’d have been quite the coincidence if web components had happened to be a useful set of primitives for implementing something like Svelte or Solid. Quite a few of the people who build and maintain the frameworks themselves hold on to a lingering animosity because many of them feel gaslit about the capabilities of Web Components. Their perception of reality was that these standards were not useful to them at all, but the message they got – insistently – was that web components were the inevitable future of their own frameworks. This is the background that led Ryan Carniato, the author of SolidJS, to write his blog post Web Components Are Not the Future. That blog post is a reaction to a specific line of rhetoric that has gone unnoticed by most web developers because they were not the ones targeted. That’s why it looked like such an odd, angry, outburst to many and those foolish enough to support their chosen web development tech as if it were a football team took it or the reaction to it as validation that their “team” was better than the others. What’s missing from this are the reasons why React and its descendants won out over Web Components and their ecosystem. Just because you might not easily be able to use web components to implement something like SolidJS, that’s a very different kind of problem from what most regular web developers are tackling. Ryan might have a justifiable gripe against a small group of over-enthusiastic Web Components promoters, but that doesn’t answer the question that rises when you realise that React and Web Components are generationally peers – to the point of React having its first stable release in 2016 just like Web Components: Why did React win? And the answer to that, in my oh so personal opinion, isn’t “because Web Components aren’t great for specific kinds of problems, such as those framework maintainers deal with” no matter how technically reasonable that might sound. Remember, these technical observations and conclusions are popping up after React was well on its way towards resoundingly winning the popularity contest that is modern web dev. I think it comes down to a simple difference in promises. Web components promise you that you’ll be able to extend the DOM in ways that are idiomatically compatible in with the rest of the DOM. React promised us a silver bullet: unidirectional data flow would fix UI development once and for all. Magical silver bullets will always be more popular than boring old incremental improvement. React offered two benefits to organisations: Both of these promises are science-fiction, and experienced React devs as well as React maintainers are both likely to be the first to point that out. People still believed in these fictions, and many still do. Both require some explanation. React’s core innovation was to treat the UI as a virtual data structure that could be reconciled with, or rendered to, whatever stateful group of objects you were using to render the actual User Interface. This was deliberately agnostic about whether the rendering target was a Document Object Model, a hierarchy of AppKit or UIKit objects, or whatever it is that Android has got going. This meant you could structure your UI components as a set of functions or classes that together took the app’s state and returned a tree-like data structure and, because these were in theory just accepting and returning data, you could steal ideas from functional programming – immutable objects, no side effects, baby! – to make the whole process easier. Instead of complex manipulations full of potential side effects, your mental model of your GUI app would be something along the lines of: UI = f(state) Events and actions generated by the UI modify state. That triggers the f(state) part again. The data structure returned from the components is diffed with the existing UI and the UI is updated based on that diff to reflect the new state. This is what the React scene calls “unidirectional data flow” (“one-way data flow” in more recent documentation) because data only flows from state to UI, whereas the data that flows from the UI back into state is labelled “actions” or “events”, which means they aren’t data, silly. No, the data the user is typing into the form isn’t data. It’s an action. Here, read this rambling blog post and library of old-style Twitter threads that explain it. Of course, you need to be smart enough to understand that data isn’t data except when it’s data, and it’s always going in one direction except when it’s going in the other, in which case it’s a cycle, which makes it all one direction. Something about drawing it as a circle somehow makes people miss the fact that stuff is obviously flowing in multiple directions. Not just up and down, but sideways within a component and often React apps just completely drop the pretence and shove the data directly to where it belongs using things like the Context API. But, sure, the data only flows one way. You just need to have curious definitions of the words “flow”, “one”, “way”, and “data”. That, however, isn’t the problem with the idea. It’s actually a neat idea that forces you to rethink some of the basic principles of GUI software development. The problem is that it’s pretty much only an idea: a myth. What we get in practice is almost always quite different in very important ways. The issues, in no particular order: But, Baldur, you don’t understand! You don’t get React! Oh, I understand. When I use a model object that’s connected to a view object using a coordinating object (controller, presenter, or whatever), then sure that’s MVC or MVP. But, when you do it, it’s a parent component that’s using the context API and hooks to coordinate a state object with a functional child component. Effectively, as soon as you try to do meaningful work with React, the “unidirectional data flow” ceases to be an architecture and becomes an origin myth. Meanwhile the actual architecture is whatever uncoordinated “I can’t believe it’s not MVC” hocus pocus is popular in the React scene the week the project was started. For a very brief period, React’s tag line was something like “The V in MVC”, but they quickly gave that up because there’s so much more in React than just the components. They have an entire array of state and event management tools that together assemble whatever app architecture you want. React has always been the whole kit and caboodle, not just a “V”. It’s just never enforced a single, coherent architecture and instead provided hooks and tools with no direction and soft boundaries. But it promised magic, and people didn’t seem to notice that, in time, making and maintaining a React app was just as much work, if not more, as those made using more traditional approaches. Moreover, React apps that were explicitly structured using the Model-View-Controller architecture from the ground up tended to, in my personal opinion as an extremely biased outside observer, be less problematic over time than those that went all in on the unidirectional gravy train. A promise of magic is always going to be more popular than promising to give you sensible – the “wear practical shoes, it’s going to be a long walk” kind of sensible – steps forward. Even if Web Components had met with universal approval among browser vendors right out of the gate, it’s unlikely they would have ever won out over the promise of making the development of dynamic user interfaces magically easier. It should not be surprising that more modern component frameworks, ones that aren’t saddled with a largely fictional core concept, such as Vue, Svelte, or SolidJS are by almost every metric faster, lighter, and more productive than React. Preact even manages to be a far superior “React” than React itself. React has become a bloated carcass of false promises, misleading claims, and unending layers of backwards compatibility – the wrong kind of backwards compatibility, as they still occasionally break your fucking code when updating. Pretty much anything else is a better tool for pretty much any web development task. There’s also more genuinely useful innovation going on everywhere except React. SolidJS came up with signals, a genuinely interesting method for handling state. Preact adopted it and arguably came up with a more interoperable implementation of the idea. Vue and Svelte both hew closer to web norms in interesting ways. If you want innovation and experimentation, there’s a lot of it going around. Just not in React. Promises of magic only go so far. Since the consensus of the overall effect that React has had on the web is currently ranging from “on the whole, probably not great” to “the only thing that would be worse for the web would be a comet wiping out all civilisation, and even that would be a blessed relief,” if that were all, React would not be nearly as dominant in the web software industry as it still is today. That’s where commodifying developers comes in. In basic terms, what management wants is the ability to add, remove, or move around staff while pretending that said staff is largely interchangeable and that the moving around doesn’t mess things up in and of itself. This is the case for most modern companies, not just the ones in tech. Any form of expertise or specialisation makes that idea even more fictional than it already is. Employers generally love whatever scheme they find that can narrow the skill sets required to do a task down to something that can be clearly defined in market terms. One way to do that is by requiring specific degrees and certifications. Another is to standardise on using specific tools and platforms and hiring for those. You don’t try to hire people with good problem-solving skills, an ability for writing clearly, an affinity for numbers, or an understanding of how computers work that helps them pick up new apps quickly. You hire for skills in “Word” and “Excel”. That lets you hire quickly, fire quickly, and move people around as if they were, I don’t know, Legos or something. (Sorry, “Lego bricks”, he corrects himself before the pedants light their torches and grab their pitchforks.) This is hard to accomplish in software development. The entire job is basically discovering and solving poorly-defined problems with squishy human elements at its centre. React stepped in just in time to help managers en masse fake their way to a promotion during a low-interest-rate bubble. Much like “Word” and “Excel” have become the “fungibility” stand-ins for “can write clearly” and “understands numbers”, React has become a stand-in for “UI software development”. It hides the complexities of what’s happening underneath a layer of abstractions. Instead of learning a host of DOM querying and manipulation APIs or the workings of platforms like UIKit, you just return JSX. Instead of exposing the various nuances and intricacies of event handling on each platform, you get one form of event delegation and you’re going to like it. The JSX data structures are so abstracted away from the actual platform that they even offer approaches for you to pretend there isn’t any difference between a web, iOS, and Android app and let you target (or try to target) all with a single code base. React developers interact with a drastically simplified view of the world. Because that simplified view has limitations, the underlying platforms push their way into the job with alarming regularity. But because the point of hiring for React is to not hire people with the specialised skills to deal with the nuances of underlying platform, most of the time everybody reaches for a dependency instead. Something made by somebody with a deeper understanding of the underlying platform that packages up a set of solutions that those with full-on React blinkers can use. This heavy reliance on dependencies compounds React’s many pre-existing performance problems. The bloat of these web apps isn’t accidental but a by-product of how React is used by management. (I’ve written about this before, for those who are curious.) Understanding how the DOM works is a hard requirement for using tools to extend the DOM. This made Web Components a non-starter. Web Components didn’t help enable the massive growth in head count that drove much of the decision-making in tech from 2011-2022. Bear this in mind below, when I go into some of the technical limitations of Web Components. Those limitations are not the reasons why React won. React ended up the winner because it devalued software developers and made promises it could never fulfil. If that were all, then web components would just be a textbook case of over-aggressive promotion and hubris leading to self-sabotage, and a useful but limited technology losing out primarily because of the market’s many dysfunctions. Both are a regular occurrence in tech and software development. But has had other consequences. It has fractured the online web development community. The React-versus-everybody-else schism is obvious, but the other schisms are arguably more tragic. Specifically, drama surrounding Web Components and a steady parade of similar events has fractured the part of the community that is trying to get the industry to stop using what has now become the actual legacy framework: React. Instead of a united front that promotes a set of approaches as alternatives to React, each with differing optimal use cases, we now have three factions that do not collaborate nearly as much as they should: The differences between these groups are not technical. WebC and Svelte both use single file HTML components and compile to HTML, CSS, and JS, usually mediated through a chosen site generator – “meta-framework” if you will – Eleventy and SvelteKit respectively, and they both include custom elements as compile targets. Any debate that presupposes a fundamental technical difference, beyond just their relative sizes, between these two frameworks is already in the wilderness. Using Lit is not morally superior to using Vue. Different frameworks have different trade-offs and, yeah, that does mean that sometimes one is a more productive choice for a situation than the other. Sometimes that means that Lit, Eleventy with WebC, or Enhance, are the better choices. Sometimes it’s Vue, SolidJS, or Svelte. The core difference between the second and third groups is that the third group, like SolidJS for example, often tried at some point to integrate various parts of the Web Components stack into the implementation of their projects and became very frustrated with the technology and now many of them seem to be quite bitter about web components as a result. They were promised platform fundamentals that – because they were the future of frameworks – would work as building blocks of their own projects. This is a needless divide. “Use the platform” developers, web component frameworks, and modern reactive frameworks can all use and benefit from web components today. You can use a web component in Svelte and you can use Svelte to make a web component. WebC will work well using a Svelte component that has been compiled to a custom element. Those who eschew frameworks can use components made in either in their projects. Web Components, if the goal was to improve interoperability and reuse, are a smashing success. They are an incredibly useful building block for modern websites that’s only going to become more useful now that we have broader support for form-participating custom elements. Lea Verou does a good job of explaining what Web Components are good for in her own post on this topic: Frameworks already use native HTML elements in their components. Web components extend what native elements can do, and thus make crafting project-specific components easier across all frameworks (as well as no frameworks). I tried to find a better way to phrase this, but Lea already came up with the perfect framing. Most devs could just stop here, read Lea’s post, nod a few times as they scroll, and be done with it. (Though, you’re most of the way through this behemoth of an essay by now, so you might as well read i to the end.) This is how Web Components work. This is how we should be using web components and frameworks. (And, by the way, the fact that the Font Awesome people have hired her and Zach Leatherman have turned my scepticism about Web Awesome into outright enthusiasm, even if Zach isn’t involved in it directly. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they and Font Awesome do in the future.) However, the underlying technical reasons why web components are a bad fit for some software architectures are still there, largely unexplored. I’ve had to use web components quite a bit, myself. I largely like them. I even see the appeal of the Shadow DOM, despite its many issues. I’ve used web components (no framework), Lit (a framework designed with web components in mind), and Svelte (a reactive component framework) for complex projects, and I’ve experimented with a lot of the rest with prototypes. But, in my experience, using web components, with or without Lit, to implement a big project end-to-end was usually harder and more complicated than using a reactive framework for the same purposes. It was also sometimes harder than using no framework at all. When people say “use the platform” they aren’t just talking about the handful of Web Component APIs. The platform has more to offer than Custom Elements and Shadow DOMs. Web components can be suboptimal for many projects for reasons that are very similar to the reasons why they aren’t useful for the internal implementation of frameworks like Solid or Svelte, but I can’t speak for framework implementers, only for myself. The first issue has to do with how web components interact with the rest of the Document Object Model (DOM). Every API that’s commonly bundled under the “Web Components” umbrella is defined in terms of their alterations to the DOM: Shadow DOM, custom elements, even the <template> element to some degree. Using them requires injecting them into the DOM tree at specific points. That quickly becomes problematic because the semantics of the DOM are highly dependent on specific hierarchies. The list could go on forever because this is a fundamental part of how both HTML and SVG are designed, so it’s happening throughout both. The DOM fundamentally uses hierarchy for composition. The same element will have different functionality and meaning depending on what parents it has. To use object-oriented terms, the DOM relies heavily on both composition (“X is extended by having a Y”) and inheritance (“X is extended by being a Y and inheriting its features”) in a complex system that does not easily allow for intermediaries. A list only works if the parent ordered or unordered list element is in a direct “has a” relationship with child list elements. Direct parent-child element relationships is one of the building blocks of DOM composition. Components, as an architectural concept, need to add behaviour to and render into these kinds of hierarchies without breaking their structure. Components in many reactive frameworks solve this by not injecting themselves into the DOM at all. They return elements that the rendering context will integrate into the DOM, but they generally won’t be a part of the explicit DOM hierarchy themselves. You don’t want a ListComponent to wrap the li elements it returns in <list-component> tags because that would break the semantics of the DOM. The list would no longer function as a proper list. Components in these frameworks generally exist as an abstraction outside the DOM. A rendering context takes that abstraction (often a “virtual” DOM) and render to the “actual” DOM. That many developers misuse frameworks doesn’t change the fact that modern frameworks are specifically structured around the ability to deliver semantic and accessible DOMs without breaking the parent-child composition that’s integral to modern HTML. This is React’s positive legacy to the world of web development: a way of making components that don’t interfere with the Document Object Model’s core methods for composition and extension. That positive legacy has been carried forward and improved by modern web frameworks. Once you lose the mythical “unidirectional data flow” baggage, and aren’t trying to build the universal UI engine, “return a data structure that gets diffed and merged with a corresponding part of the DOM” is actually a neat and productive idea that fits extremely well with traditional approaches to working with the DOM, such as template rendering. If you look towards approaches to state management that are more akin to the matching up of models with views through some coordination, functional reactive components actually begin to look kind of awesome. They aren’t quite the magic solution React promised, but they are a meaningful and substantial improvement. That’s where we’re at with modern frameworks. That’s what many of the Web Components frameworks are trying for as well, even though they are held back by how custom elements inevitably inject themselves into the DOM, because custom elements are defined in terms of, well, custom DOM elements. That “injection” can make the DOM dysfunctional by interfering with the hierarchy many elements require. It took years for them to finally fix some of the issues Shadow DOM has with forms, and we still occasionally have issues with it interfering with aria- property references, which are used to properly expose the UI to accessibility tools, and labelling across components. How selection APIs interact with Shadow DOMs are still a mess (though hopefully not for long). Custom elements can’t easily be used to render list or table child elements directly. They don’t work at all for extending SVG, which is the only vector drawing surface available to the broader web. Even if you pretend Safari doesn’t exist and just look at Firefox’s progress, their support for form-associated elements was released in 2021, five years after the “v1” release of web components. It’s been a long road. These standards seem legitimately hard to implement, which is what you’d expect once you realise they’re messing with some of the core structures of the web platform. This issue with hierarchical interjection is why you occasionally hear framework types say that web components should mostly be used as “leaf nodes”. If the web component has no children visible to the framework – is a “leaf” not a branch – then it can’t break the hierarchy. It’s a useful rule of thumb if you’re working in the framework world and fits well with how Lea Verou defined the relationship between web components and frameworks in the post I quoted above. The CSS property display: contents; also goes some way to alleviate this issue as it can be used to effectively “disappear” the custom element from the rendering tree, so it doesn’t interfere with, for example, the parent-child relationship between a <ul> and <li> element. This doesn’t address the SVG gap, but if that ends up being the only big issue remaining, then Web Components are in much better shape than many expected they’d ever be in. But, we’re still missing the ability to create custom elements that extend built-in elements. That would be the last remaining issue to solve and would let you deliver web components that render elements like <li> or <td> without interfering with the hierarchy. It is the key to perfecting web components and bringing about the future we were promised. Or is it? There’s reason to believe that the Safari team might be have been right to refuse to implement the is attribute and not let custom elements extend built-ins. When you work with markup, hierarchy can serve as a very powerful form of composition. But, as I outlined earlier, that hasn’t worked too well for custom elements until fairly recently. In practice, their inclusion in the DOM hierarchy often interferes with the composition of built-in elements with little benefit to the custom element itself. Beyond that, there’s a tension inherent in how custom elements were designed. They are simultaneously late- and early bound. They are dynamically late-bound to an element name, <my-custom-element> for example, that then automatically works in the markup and DOM. A script can define a custom element with any valid name it wants. A component or function that renders HTML doesn’t need to import that script directly or have any knowledge of the custom element. The developer can change the composition of a DOM tree simply by mapping a different custom element implementation to that name. The communication between the custom element and its surrounding context is done through messages – events – attributes, and object properties. None of the elements in the surrounding context need to even be aware that the implementation of the custom element has been switched to a different one. This is a form of late binding, or loose coupling, and late-binding is extremely useful for building applications with user interfaces because it lends itself to building complex functionality through composition without, well, binding you to a rigid structure that can be hard to alter as the design realities of the interface are surfaced. You can still easily modify the project as the app gets tested and user feedback pours in. As Alan Kay explained: Late binding allows ideas learned late in project development to be reformulated into the project with exponentially less effort than traditional early binding system. This is a good thing. At the same time, the implementation of custom elements is based on highly specific inheritance that can’t be easily remapped. If you’re rendering in a browser, the HTMLElement class is always going to be HTMLElement. Even though you can technically replace it – JavaScript is a late-bound language as designed – doing so risks breaking the DOM entirely. That means that the implementation and state management of a web component is tightly coupled to its ancestor classes and that will generally make reformulations and alterations harder. Moreover, the DOM’s existing class inheritance tree was not made with web developer subclassing in mind. Its inheritance is complicated and a mess. A few elements actually share interfaces, such as the <q> and <blockquote> elements sharing the HTMLQuoteElement interface and a whole mess of legacy elements sharing the HTMLUnknownElement interface. This complicates matters. Extending built-in elements also has an extremely controversial history and frameworks messing around with built-in language objects, such as Array, have directly hindered platform development and standardisation multiple times in the past. But subclassing those should be fine, right? The subclasses should break anything, right? Well, this is where Liskov’s Gun goes “blam!” because the answer to that is “probably not”. Let’s look at the Liskov substitution principle itself, the one cited by that WebKit developer all those years ago: Subtype Requirement: Let ⁠ ϕ ( x ) ⁠ be a property provable about objects ⁠ x ⁠ of type T. Then ⁠ ϕ ( y ) ⁠ should be true for objects ⁠ y ⁠ of type S where S is a subtype of T. Well that clears that right up! So clear. So obvious. That doesn’t sound like gobbledygook to regular humans at all! Effectively, paraphrasing the above-linked Wikipedia page into human(ish) terms, what it means is that if S is a subclass of T objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering the correctness of the program. That is, if you subclass HTMLInputElement, instances of your subclass need to work correctly whenever they’re substituted for an instance of the original HTMLInputElement and, because JavaScript as a language isn’t really able to offer any such guarantee, this principle can’t easily be enforced in the browser runtime. So, you’re left with debating the principle itself, which is an argument that can definitely be made on an abstract level, but once you narrow it down to DOM elements specifically, I think the overall principle becomes quite compelling. Remember the section above about how the DOM uses hierarchy (“has a” relationships) for composition? How elements such as <table>, <li>, and <input> to name a few, need specific parent-child relationships to function properly? Well, the built-in subclasses that provide the interfaces these elements use are an important part of making that composition work. One of the more important uses cases for web components is to let people implement and distribute reusable widget that are interoperable across multiple projects, frameworks, or even organisations. Much of the standardisation work surrounding web components has been towards ensuring that these packaged widgets don’t interfere with the outside DOM and that they won’t be interfered with by it in return. That’s what the Shadow DOM is for. Because of this, you can take a <custom-date-picker> widget and include it in your project without much worry, provided you aren’t using it to wrap elements that require a direct parent-child relationship with specific other elements to work. Now that we have broad support for form-associated elements, this mostly works and provides a good foundation for interesting projects such as a new generation of open source widget libraries. But if you take an <input is="custom-date-picker"> element, you don’t have the same assurances. You don’t know whether you can actually use it in all the same ways you can use a regular input element. JavaScript can’t offer you that guarantee. Remember that every built-in custom element begins life as their original parent class before they get upgraded by the custom element script, so it could start off being compatible but then suddenly become incompatible when a script loads. Seen from this perspective, broad adoption of custom elements that extend built-in elements does seem likely to cause serious and hard-to-solve bugs in a non-trivial proportion of the projects who would use them. Or, in the words of Ryosuke Niwa, the WebKit dev who originally cited the Liskov substitution principle, writing on the topic eight years ago: One fundamental problem is that subclassing a subclass of HTMLInputElement or HTMLImageElement often leads to a violation of the Liskov substitution principle over time. Because they’re builtin elements, they’re very likely to be extended in the future. Imagine that we had this feature supported before type=date was added. Then your subclass of HTMLInputElement must also support type=date in order to satisfy the substitution principle. Similarly, imagine we had added this feature before srcset was added to HTMLImageElement and you wrote a subclass of HTMLImageElement. Then not supporting srcset results in the violation of the principle again. In addition, none of the builtin elements are designed to be subclassed, and in fact, we don’t have builtin subclasses of HTMLElement that are also builtins. This limits the usefulness of any sort of subclassing. Furthermore, we don’t have any hooks for the processing models and internal states of builtin elements such as the dirtiness of HTMLImageElement’s value and when and how HTMLInputElement picks the appropriate image. I mean, yeah. When it’s put this way, it does sound problematic. Overall, class inheritance versus composition is a classic question of trade-offs in software development and in software with graphical user interfaces – especially web-based ones – I’d argue that inheritance is the wrong trade-off for this task in particular because it’s interfering with an already complex inheritance system, which in turn can complicate even further how custom elements interact with the hierarchical composition of markup. Reactive components, as implemented by most modern frameworks, make a different trade-off. They tend to be functional, even if they aren’t implemented as functions. They still inherit React’s issue of only working when rendered to a DOM with all the side effects that entails, but because most of them are thinner abstractions than React and target fewer platforms, I’d argue that the issue has become more manageable. You render to a DOM element and test that element as a data structure. With React you often don’t even know if the final target is a DOM element, HTML string, Android view, or UIKit view. Instead of the subclasses you have to deal with in Web Components, you often have a series of function invocations that treat the returned DOM representation as, ideally, side-effect-free data they can modify and pass on. Immutable data structures are popular in among this crowd for good reasons. The representation that’s returned usually isn’t an actual DOM fragment, but gets resolved and rendered into the “real” DOM by a rendering context. To quote Mayank I can create an <Input> primitive component that wraps an <input> element. And I can create a <ThemedInput> component that wraps the primitive <Input>. Then someone else can take my <ThemedInput> and create a <PasswordInput> on top of it. After all of these components are resolved and initialized, the final DOM tree should really only contain a single <input> element. The intermediate components are not (always) relevant for the DOM tree. The browser doesn’t care how the code on my website is organized. In other words, components are totally made up. That doesn’t mean components are not useful; just that they exist in a different plane. This is what makes it possible to compose all the way up to a <Page> component Trying to accomplish this with web components is tricky and the end result is usually a deeply nested tree of custom elements. You can hide some of that in Shadow DOMs but that introduces a new set of problems caused by the Shadow DOM itself. Using web components as native-like components that are entirely external to the rendering process bypasses this in part, but if you are authoring the “leaf” web components yourself, I’d argue that the emphasis on inheritance and de-emphasis of composition will make the creation of complex widgets harder and more error-prone than it would be with a framework’s component system. The interoperability benefits and the fact you’re building with web standards, which generally do not change once they’ve been shipped across multiple browsers, gives you stability and should lower development costs in the long run. For many, if not most, organisations this trade-off should be worthwhile. But there’s a good chance that using web components to implement the core architecture of your app could make the task harder. You’re likely to have to lean heavily on inheritance and classes and eschew composition for implementing the logic and flow of the application. It absolutely can be done, either by minimising your use of class inheritance or by being thoughtful about it, but one of the reasons why reactive component frameworks, even though all the modern ones are considerably younger than web components as a technology, are so popular among devs, even the developers that don’t have to use React for organisational or political reasons, is that their architecture makes these tasks a little bit simpler. Interlocking functional components that use signals for state, for example, are easier to use and reason about than interlocking class-based web components that use properties and events for state and reactivity. This does not matter that much if the web component is a “leaf” node, the last stop on the line so to speak, but it begins to matter a lot if these components are being use throughout an app’s overall structure. Thankfully, you don’t have to use a framework to get these features. You can write functional components that use signals for reactive state using either standalone lit-html or uhtml tagged template libraries. You don’t need the full framework baggage. Some frameworks, such as Enhance offer similar capabilities that are functional and reactive out of the box. We have a spectrum of options that range from using only platform APIs, to specialised libraries, to lightweight frameworks, and all the way to fully-fledged “batteries included” web development frameworks. One size very much does not fit all. We should feel free to choose the toolset that’s appropriate for our task and our project. We should not saddle ourselves with unnecessary work out of habit or misplaced loyalties towards one “team” or another. And none of us should be using React. Web components don’t really work for quite a few of the tasks we were initially told they would be good for. Pointing that out isn’t a criticism of the web as a platform. Nor does it imply that you should always use a framework or that you can’t get anything done using just platform APIs with a small selection of libraries. All it means is that this particular slice of the web platform turned out to have limitations we need to be mindful of when we do our work. Given the limitations I went into above, it doesn’t surprise me that many framework implementers found it hard or impossible to use web components to implement a framework for reactive functional components. There’s a clear mismatch there. It also casts some light on what framework maintainers mean when they say that Web Components are a bad direction for web development. If web components, specifically, represent the future of web development, then it’s a future filled with awkward class inheritance hierarchies, even deeper markup hierarchies, and layers of code whose only purpose it is to mitigate how custom elements and the Shadow DOM interfere with regular HTML and SVG composition. It’s a vision of a future where web development is substantially harder, less powerful, and less productive. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s a future anybody wants or is even working towards. Web Components are great for what they are, genuinely great, but they don’t represent the extent or promise of the platform. There’s so much more happening. Recent additions to the web platform are squarely aimed at a much brighter future, one that helps developers implement great experiences without sacrificing usability, performance, or accessibility. That’s just to name a few and does not even begin to go into the many potential future standards that might improve things even further. Web standardisation today is in a much better place than it was a few years ago and instead of pushing the web harder in the direction of web components, most people seem content to sand off their rough edges and make them work better with the rest of the platform, using features such as Declarative Shadow DOM and ElementInternals. We’re letting web components “be their best selves”. Over time, these improvements to the platform might together change how we do web development in meaningful ways: It’s increasingly popular to rail against the existence of web apps. People get angry about how much crap gets loaded into your average website. The web is filled with ads and tracking software that are making it less and less usable. Quite a few sites are also implemented using bloated frameworks that would be barely acceptable if they were being used to implement a revolutionary killer app but are completely beyond the pale for building a regular website or dashboard. The web is a mess that seems to only be getting less usable and messier by the minute. You’d be justified in dismissing the entire concept of web apps: Websites don’t need this. This is all bullshit. But none of the tech I’ve discussed is really to blame for what has happened to the web. That lies squarely with advertising as a business model and React’s unique dysfunctions. Web Components, new web APIs, and newer more modern frameworks of every kind represent our path out of the web crisis and shouldn’t be rejected just because they involve JavaScript. This isn’t just a question of fixing web’s current issues. We need web apps. We both need more web apps, and we need more capable web apps. Mainstream Operating Systems – Android, ChromeOS, Windows, macOS, iOS, and the rest – are increasingly closed platforms whose primary software markets are managed through conservative and puritanical central committees: their hidebound App Stores. The platforms themselves are constantly shifting and changing depending on what fad the OS vendor is chasing to boost its stock price. For example, many iOS app developers sacrifice months of every year updating their apps to keep up with platform changes. If they don’t, they lose customers because their apps are broken or perceived to be broken. These are months they could be using to implement genuine improvements to their apps and to build their businesses. Those businesses can only use the specific business models approved by a platform’s central committee, are only allowed to include the content deemed morally appropriate by that central committee, and need to have every update and minute elements of its marketing strategy approved by faceless serfs working in a soul-draining bureaucracy. More importantly, these institutions also do not stand up to authoritarian powers. They will bow down to the demands of China, and they will not stand in the way of an authoritarian takeover of a democratic country. We need web apps. Web apps are the only open and standardised GUI software development and distribution platform that’s available to us. Discarding them out of spite or annoyance is exactly the sort of situation that the phrase “don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater” was coined for. We need this. And, thankfully, web standards are slowly but surely stepping up. Now we only need to make sure that OS vendors, such as Google or Apple, don’t stand in its way. And we need to make sure we don’t stand in its way.

by Mark Steyn Clubland Q&A October 9, 2024 https://www.steynonline.com/14692/live-around-the-planet-wednesday-october-9th Thank you for all your questions. If you missed the live broadcast, the action replay can be heard in full here. UPPERDATE! We're live now, so let's have at it! UPDATE! We'll be going live in about fifteen minutes, so do get ready to fire off your questions via the comment form below. See you at the top of the hour. And to listen simply click the livestream feed. Yes, it's me! Mark Steyn of that ilk - back in the saddle for another hour of questions from Steyn Clubbers around the planet. Our Clubland Q&A starts live at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm British Summer Time/9pm Central European. If you chance to be elsewhere, do check local listings below. As we go to air, Hurricane Milton - the world's strongest this year - is barreling down on Florida, a mere fortnight after Hurricane Helene. We hope our many Club members in the Sunshine State, and others in the path of this storm, will stay safe. Six million Floridians have been ordered to evacuate. America is four weeks from its laughably misnamed "Election Day", so there are political implications to meteorological phenomena in swing states. I'm happy to discuss those or anything else on your mind, but I am particularly mindful of the callousness of our age. I'm thinking not just of bigfoot media's indifference to the suffering in Appalachia, but of a thousand smaller, daily tragedies. Last Thursday, for example, Dr Jackie Stone became the latest Covid contrarian to be driven to kill herself: On 3 October @DrJackieStone took her own life. Everything she valued and found purpose in was taken from her. If you don't know by now, this is how it works if you speak up against The Narrative. Here is an extract from her final interview. 🎥Me and @woodybaloo... pic.twitter.com/RiTmLXT02I I cannot claim to have known Dr Stone except through the Internet - she followed me on Twitter after we began telling the stories of vaccine victims on The Mark Steyn Show. I knew that she had developed an effective protocol for treating Covid that included Ivermectin - she practised in Zimbabwe, where, strange though it may sound to American and European ears, the government was rather less deranged in the Covid years than that of, say, Minnesota or France. Nevertheless, because Dr Stone's treatment was insufficient of a cash cow for Big Pharma and the public health agencies they have corrupted, she was targeted and, as noted above, lost everything in her life. After hosting a health summit with other dissident doctors at Victoria Falls just over two months ago, she fell into despair and joined the lengthening list of those around the world so comprehensively punished for their dissent that there was nothing left but suicide. You may be over Covid but Covid isn't over you - because it's the template for your future. The evil men who imposed the lockdown/vaccine regime on you will do it all over again next time - even though, as we now know, they went to "drug-fueled sex parties" while a generation of kids was psychologically kiboshed and women's fertility nosedived across the west. The "conventional wisdom" is now literally killing us - and yet, as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry have recently assured us, in the future they're building any objection to it will not be tolerated. On today's Clubland Q&A I'm happy to entertain your thoughts on that, or on anything else you want to raise. Whether or not you're a member of The Mark Steyn Club, you can listen to our show live as it happens wherever you chance to be on this turbulent earth: Club membership is required only to ask a question. We love to hear from brand new members, and especially appreciate those who are having such a great time in these parts that they've signed up a chum for a Steyn Club Gift Membership. Among the additions to our ranks in recent days are newbies from around the globe - from Belfast to Bigfork, from Tokoroa to Thief River Falls, from London, Ontario to Latham in the Australian Capital Territory. Whether you've joined this week either for a full year or a see-how-it-goes experimental quarter, do shoot me a head-scratcher for today's show. But, if you're not interested in joining, no worries, as they say in Oz: We seek no unwilling members - and as always the show is free to listen to, so we hope you'll want to tune in. So see you back here at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm in London, 9pm in Paris, 10pm in Jerusalem; half-past-ten in Teheran; midnight-forty-five in Kathmandu; 3am in Singapore and Honkers (sorry about that); 5am in Sydney and Melbourne; 7am in Auckland, and a rather more convivial hour for the kippers and kedgeree in His Majesty's Dominions eastward across the Pacific, where you're so far ahead I've probably already lost my appeal by now...

Title: Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan

October 09, 2024 09:55 ET | Source: Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”)LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan Alliance Witan PLC (“Alliance Witan” or the “Company”) announces that its investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), has appointed Jennison Associates (“Jennison”) as an additional stock picker for its multi-manager global equity portfolio, taking the total number of stock pickers to eleven. New York and Boston-based Jennison was founded in 1969. It has $210 billion of assets under management (as of 30 June 2024) and specialises in investing in companies with exceptional growth prospects. Jennison previously managed part of the multi-manager global equity portfolio of Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) before the latter’s combination with Alliance Trust plc to create Alliance Witan (the “Combination”), which completed on 9 October. Jennison’s allocation of approximately 5% of the Company’s portfolio has been largely filled from a subset of the stocks which it managed within Witan. Most of the balance of Witan’s portfolio transferred pursuant to the Combination has been handed to BlackRock, which is acting as transition manager, for realignment. However, with two managers in common between Alliance Trust and Witan – Veritas Asset Management and GQG Partners – there have also been some other in specie transfers of stock which will be retained. The overall risk profile of the Alliance Witan portfolio will remain largely unchanged from that of the Alliance Trust portfolio before the Combination, reflecting the continuation of the distinctive multi-manager approach previously employed. There will be no major regional, style or sectoral biases relative to the market, with most of the added value designed to come from stock picking. Details of allocations by manager will be available in the next factsheet. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “Jennison has long been one of our highest-rated managers and will diversify our exposure to growth stocks. The combination with Witan gives us the opportunity to transfer them in largely in-specie, hence with relatively low transaction costs.” 9 October 2024

Title: TCPC stock touches 52-week low at $8.03 amid market challenges

In a turbulent market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, dipping to $8.03. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -26.42% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring TCPC as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its performance and valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the company's short-term outlook and potential strategic adjustments moving forward. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has announced a series of leadership changes. Rajneesh Vig will step down from his roles as Chairman and CEO but will remain on the Board of Directors until January 31, 2025. Phil Tseng will take over as Chairman and CEO, and Jason Mehring will assume the role of President. Patrick Wolfe has been appointed the new COO, and Dan Worrell will join Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. The company also reported notable financial achievements. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, resulting in an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. The Q2 2024 earnings report disclosed an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of about 14%. A third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share was declared, indicating a strong financial position. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a smooth transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent dip to a 52-week low aligns with several key insights from InvestingPro. The stock's volatility and recent price decline are reflected in InvestingPro data, which shows a 22.62% price drop over the last three months. This downward trend is further emphasized by the stock trading at just 66.09% of its 52-week high. Despite these challenges, TCPC maintains a significant dividend yield of 24.16%, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that TCPC has maintained dividend payments for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns even in difficult times. However, the company's financial health presents a mixed picture. While TCPC's revenue grew by 16.64% over the last twelve months, reaching $232.32 million, an InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company was not profitable during this period. This aligns with the negative P/E ratio of -11.32 and the diluted EPS of -$0.71. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 5 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into TCPC's financial situation and future prospects.

TOPSHOT - Union members react as Aerospace Machinists District 751 President Jon Holden (out of ... [+] frame) announces that union members rejected a proposed Boeing contract and will go on strike, following voting results at their union hall in Seattle, Washington, on September 12, 2024. Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike on September 12, rejecting a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for staff given the company's stressed financial condition. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks staged broad rallies on Tuesday with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 1% and Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.45% Small cap stops were flat on the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%. Markets have been swayed a bit by activity in China where some mixed messaging from the government has caused wide swings in prices. After recently announcing aggressive stimulus measures that boosted stock prices, many expected a furthering of those plans this week. However, when Chinese authorities hosted a press conference Tuesday, hopes for yet more stimulus were dashed. A couple weeks ago I made the comment that it felt as if China was throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at their economy. The failure to announce any additional plans on Tuesday brings up concerns that China is running out of options. This is still an evolving story and one worth monitoring as it could have implications for U.S. markets. Back here at home, there are a few stocks I'll be following today. Boeing announced it was breaking off talks with its machinist union. The company withdrew its most recent offer to raise wages by 30% and as of now, there are no plans to restart the negotiations. In the wake of the contract negotiations breakdown, S&P Global Ratings said it may lower its rating on Boeing bonds to junk status which would likely be a significant blow to the company whose stock is already down around 40% for the year. Shares of Google parent company, Alphabet are lower by 0.5% in premarket. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced they may seek to have the company broken up, alleging the current structure creates a monopoly. This is an interesting story not just in terms of what happens to Alphabet, but also, what type of precedent this may set for other companies, some of which comprise the Magnificent Seven. Should the company be broken apart, I would not be surprised if it spurred activity around companies such as Meta or even Apple. The question I would have is whether those companies seek spinoffs before possibly being forcibly broken apart, or if the companies would instead fight the DOJ. I actually believe these types of breakups, although disruptive in the short term, can have potential to benefit shareholders, so it is something to keep an eye on. Constellation Energy has seen its stock surge nearly 80% since early August. While we don't typically think of energy stocks as exciting, the sector is in play because of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The computing power for AI and energy required is creating a lot of interesting activity in the sector. In addition to established players in the field, new entrants are also emerging. Companies such as Oklo Incorporated, whose stock has more than doubled from a low of $5.35 just last month, are drawing attention to a sector not typically considered as high growth. Speaking of AI, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor reported strong earnings overnight. That stock is indicated higher by just under 1% in premarket. The positive news also has shares of Nvidia indicated higher by 1% and trading at a new all-time high. We'll see if a breakout to new highs has the ability to excite the broader market as well. For today, in addition to the stocks mentioned above, I am particularly interested in the release of the most recent Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from last month's reading. As I mentioned on Monday, given the magnitude of the cut to interest rates but continued indication of strength in the economy, I think these minutes will garner more scrutiny than we typically see. I also think the minutes will give some context to tomorrow's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Friday's Producer Price Index (PPI). Friday will also be the start to earnings season with both JP Morgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report.

Title: Evercore ISI stock rated Outperform on Amazon amid Kuiper costs
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/evercore-isi-stock-rated-outperform-on-amazon-amid-kuiper-costs-93CH-3655418
Time Published: 2024-10-09T12:15:51Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, Evercore ISI maintained a positive outlook on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $240.00 price target. The firm's analysis highlights the impending launch of satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is set to start in the fourth quarter. Project Kuiper is Amazon's initiative to provide satellite-based Internet service, and it has garnered attention due to its significant investment and potential impact on the company's financials. According to Evercore ISI, Amazon has committed $10 billion to the project and is estimated to spend over $10 billion on 94 planned launches over the next two years. The analyst anticipates Kuiper-related losses to increase substantially in the December quarter, estimating a jump from roughly $250 million in the second quarter to between $600 million and $1 billion. This projection leads to the belief that current Street Operating Income estimates for the fourth quarter may be overly optimistic. Looking ahead to 2025, the firm estimates that losses for Kuiper could soar to between $5 billion and $6 billion before the project starts generating substantial revenue. Despite these significant costs, Evercore ISI suggests that the market opportunity for Kuiper could be undervalued. The firm points to the rapid revenue growth of similar services, like Starlink, and the attractive economics of the satellite Internet segment, which boasts EBITDA margins of 30%-50% among existing competitors. Evercore ISI also notes Amazon's competitive advantages, such as its strong consumer presence and the extensive ground infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The firm posits that even a 1% penetration of Amazon's Global Prime member base could translate to almost $750 million in annual revenue for Kuiper. Additionally, the firm expects Amazon to reveal improvements in core U.S. Retail margins during the Kuiper investment phase, which could mitigate some investor concerns regarding the project's costs. In other recent news, Cantor Fitzgerald has raised its price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to $670, maintaining an Overweight rating based on anticipated surpassing of third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter guidance. The firm's optimism stems from strong advertising checks and potential growth from features like Reels, A+, and personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon will proceed, despite Amazon's request for dismissal. The core allegations involve anti-competitive tactics and an algorithm that allegedly inflated prices for U.S. consumers. TD Cowen has maintained its Buy rating on Amazon shares, projecting a 10.7% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue growth, primarily driven by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising revenues. Similarly, Mizuho Securities has reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon, with a price target of $240.00, citing increased investment estimates in AWS and a revised upward spending forecast. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) Automotive, backed by Amazon, has revised its full-year production forecast downward due to a parts shortage. The company now anticipates producing between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles for the year, a reduction from the previously projected 57,000 units. As Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) embarks on its ambitious Project Kuiper, InvestingPro data provides additional context to the company's financial position. Despite the anticipated losses from the satellite project, Amazon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 12.32% increase over the last twelve months to $604.33 billion. This growth underscores the company's ability to invest in future technologies while maintaining its core business strength. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Amazon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.19. This suggests that the market may not be fully pricing in the company's growth potential, including the long-term benefits of Project Kuiper. Additionally, Amazon's strong return over the last five years, as noted in another InvestingPro Tip, indicates a track record of successful long-term investments. While the Kuiper project will undoubtedly impact Amazon's financials, the company's operating income margin of 9.0% and EBITDA of $104.05 billion over the last twelve months demonstrate its current profitability. This financial cushion may help Amazon weather the initial investment phase of Project Kuiper. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Amazon, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Talk about an undecided market. As of the close on Monday, October 7, in four of the past five days, the closing range of the S&P 500 (SPX) was 13.6 points. That is two-tenths of 1% based on the price of the index. For the Nasdaq, the range in four out of five days was 14.76 points or eight one-hundredths of 1%. The Nasdaq 100's (QQQ) range was 0.83 points or two-tenths of 1%. The Nasdaq and the QQQ tested their 21-day exponential a few times and remain perilously close to breaking that average, while the SPX has come close to the average on several occasions intraday. Third-quarter EPS season is now underway and the next three weeks will be very heavy with earnings reports. Just prior to and just after earnings reports, companies are in a blackout period. During that time, a company cannot repurchase its stock. So in April/early May, July/early August, October/early November, and January/early February, there is an absence of demand that can create weakness in the overall market. First-quarter 2024 share buybacks on the S&P 500 were $237 billion and for the 12-months ending March 2024, buybacks were $817 billion.

October 09, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for PLTY is October 7, 2024. 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX and YMAG) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 8, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH and GDXY.

Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: MGE Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGEE) institutional investors lost 3.2% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains

Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with MGE Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Title: Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know
URL: https://qz.com/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-weight-loss-drugs-cost-effects-1851660134
Time Published: 2024-10-09T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
A highly effective class of weight loss drug has taken the world by storm, as medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound become household names. These drugs, originally meant to treat diabetes, have become widely known for their slimming side effects. Surging demand for these drugs has transformed pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into some of the world’s most valuable companies — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts anticipate the global market for highly-coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. This guide will break down everything you need to know about these drugs, their differences, how they work, and their potential side effects. Ozempic, Wegovy, and Zepbound are all considered incretin medications, drugs that influence a group of hormones that impact insulin production in the body. These treatments work by spiking certain gut hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. Incretin drugs were originally only meant to be used for treating diabetes, but because they have also been found to reduce a user’s appetite, they have now been officially approved for weight loss and other health benefits. Ozempic is a blockbuster diabetes drug produced by the Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk. It is part of a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). This class of drugs was first developed in the 1990s when scientists identified a hormone-like molecule in the venom of a Gila monster, a lizard native to the American Southwest, that stimulated insulin secretion. Fast-forward a decade later, and companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) started selling synthetic versions of this molecule to treat diabetes. In December of 2017, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide (brand name Ozempic) for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Ozempic is one of the most advanced versions of these drugs currently on the market, as previous versions required at least once-daily injections. Ozempic is administered just once a week. Because the drug regulates blood sugar levels, reduces appetite, and slows down stomach emptying, one of its side effects is weight loss. After Ozempic’s slimming side effects became widely known, doctors started prescribing it off-label to treat a condition outside the drug’s official approval: weight loss. Novo Nordisk also tested semaglutide, the active ingredient behind Ozempic, in higher doses as a weight loss drug. In 2021, the FDA approved these higher doses of semaglutide, under the brand name Wegovy, for weight loss. As a result, in the United States and some other countries, semaglutide is prescribed and sold as Ozempic when prescribed for diabetes and as Wegovy for weight loss. Novo Nordisk is one of two pharma companies that are currently selling branded GLP-1 treatments. U.S.-based Eli Lilly is the other one. Eli Lilly’s most advanced GLP-1 drugs are Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss. The active ingredient behind both these drugs is tirzepatide. The main difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide is that the latter mimics two gut hormones — not just one — GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are chemicals that are known as incretin hormones. These hormones are secreted by the intestines after a person eats to regulate blood sugar levels. Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide increase the presence of GLP-1 and/or GIP in the human body to unnaturally high levels. Scientists aren’t sure how or why but at these spiked-up levels the hormones reduce a person’s appetite. In short, the primary reason GLP-1 drugs lead to weight loss is that people taking them eat less than they normally do. Different GLP-1 treatments have been found to work at varying speeds, according to clinical trials. The highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% of weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks. To summarize, GLP-1 drug users can expect to lose an average of 15% to 20% of their weight over the course of a year and four months. GLP-1 treatments are typically administered as weekly injections. Wegovy and Zepbound are both taken once-weekly via a subcutaneous injection, or under the skin. A month’s supply of both drugs comes with four single-dose, auto-injector pens — similar to EpiPens. Off-brand versions of these treatments are often sold in single or multi-dose vials. Additionally, Novo Nordisk sells a pill form of semaglutide, under the brand name Rybelsus, for treating type 2 diabetes. The retail price, without insurance, of Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. However, it’s important to note that these list prices don’t reflect what most customers pay after insurance and available manufacturer rebates are applied. Additionally, Eli Lilly started offering single-dose vials — instead of auto-injector pens — of its two lowest doses of Zepbound for $399 and $549 a month, respectively. This option must be paid out-of-pocket. A growing number of companies are now offering generic versions of these treatments, often priced hundreds of dollars lower than their branded counterparts. Insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have refused to cover the medication due to their high cost. A Morgan Stanley survey conducted earlier this year among GLP-1 drug users — including those using the treatments for diabetes — found that about two-thirds of respondents had their medication fully covered by insurance. Those paying out-of-pocket reported an average monthly cost of $196. Novo Nordisk claims that the majority of patients with insurance coverage pay $25 or less for a month’s supply of Ozempic or Wegovy. Additionally, Medicare started covering Wegovy this year for patients who are prescribed the medication as a way to reduce their risk of serious heart events such as heart attacks and strokes. Wegovy and Zepbound have the same side effects. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly caution that their weight loss drugs may cause serious side effects, including the potential risk of thyroid tumors. They advise that patients with a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a type of thyroid cancer, or those with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), should not use these medications. Other serious side effects include: However, the most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, headache, and fatigue. Ozempic face is a non-medical term coined by cosmetic and celebrity dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank, who observed the phenomenon among patients using weight-loss drugs. As these medications gained popularity, more patients began expressing concerns about changes in their facial appearance. Sudden weight loss can rapidly reduce facial fat, leading to changes such as skin shrinkage, sagging, and decreased elasticity. As the skin loses elastin and collagen, it becomes harder for it to retract after significant fat loss, resulting in pronounced signs of aging, loose or sagging skin, and a hollowed appearance. Probes from several health regulators, including the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and the European Medicines Agency, have all failed to find evidence that link GLP-1 drugs to suicide, suicidal thoughts, or actions. These investigations followed reports of individuals taking semaglutide and similar drugs exhibiting such behavior. While the FDA couldn’t rule out a “small risk,” it noted that a study funded by the NIH found patients on semaglutide had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts compared to those on other diabetes and anti-obesity medications. Georgios Schoretsanitis, lead author of a separate study, acknowledged no clear evidence of a causal relationship between semaglutide and suicidal ideation, but noted a potential association. His research, based on WHO data, found a 45% higher risk of reported suicidal thoughts in patients taking semaglutide. He cautioned that the results show an association, not proof of causation, and highlighted an increased risk in patients also on antidepressants. He advises clinicians to assess patients’ mental health before starting treatment. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been testing their medications for uses outside of weight loss and diabetes. For example, earlier this year the FDA approved the use of Wegovy for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular events for people who are overweight or obese. The change came just months after Novo Nordisk announced results from a clinical trial that found the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20%. For its part, Eli Lilly announced this year that tirzepatide was found to help alleviate sleep apnea in patients with obesity in late-stage clinical trials. Both companies are also testing their medications for the treatment of heart failure. Some studies have also found links between GLP-1s and a reduced risk of cancer, and alcohol and substance abuse. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been struggling to produce enough GLP-1 drugs to meet rising demand. The FDA first declared a shortage of Wegovy in March of 2022. And the pharma company has been limiting starter doses of Wegovy since 2023 to ensure there’s enough supply for patients already on the drug. Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said this March that the gap between demand for weight loss drugs and the supply is significant enough to take years to close. Mounjaro was first added to the FDA’s drug shortage list in 2022, while Zepbound was officially declared in limited supply this April. All four drugs — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound — still remain on the health regulator’s drug shortage, despite all but one dose of Wegovy being listed as currently available on the site. The FDA says that even when all doses of a drug are found to be available, there are other requirements that need to be fulfilled for a drug to be removed from the list, including whether backorders are being fulfilled. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are investing billions of dollars to ramp up production of these drugs. Novo Nordisk announced in February that it has acquired three facilities from the company’s largest shareholder, Novo Holdings, for $11 billion in an effort to address a shortage of Wegovy. The deal was made in connection with Novo Holdings’ acquisition of the drug manufacturing company Catalent (CTLT). Novo Nordisk said in a statement that the acquisition will increase the company’s production capacity beginning in 2026. Eli Lilly said in May that it will pile $5.3 billion into manufacturing its popular weight loss drugs, more than doubling its investment in a manufacturing facility in Lebanon, Indiana. The new spend brings the company’s total investment in the site to a whopping $9 billion, up from its original $3.7 billion commitment — making it now the largest manufacturing investment in the company’s history. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name drugs like Wegovy has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision. Companies like Hims & Hers, Sesame, and Noom all started selling compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than branded versions. However, there are risks. The compounded formulations are not FDA-approved, so the agency does not review the safety and efficacy of these products. Additionally, the FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing. Dozens of celebrities have come out and shared their experience with weight loss drugs. Late last year, Oprah Winfrey said she used prescription weight loss medications as a “maintenance tool.” Soon after the revelation, she left her seat from the board of WeightWatchers (WW). She had been a member of the board since 2015. In 2022, Elon Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, that he had used Wegovy. Since then, Musk has become a big proponent of GLP-1 medications. Other celebrities who have said they used these drugs are: Kelly Clarkson, Amy Schumer, Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy Morgan, and Chelsea Handler. Several pharmaceutical companies are racing to introduce their own weight loss drugs to the market and disrupt the current duopoly held by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. These companies include Viking Therapeutics, which is developing both a weight loss injection and a pill. Larger pharma companies like Roche, Amgen (AMGN), and Pfizer are also working on their own anti-obesity drugs. To combat the growing competition, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are testing their drugs — as noted above — for other health benefits. They’re also testing newer and more powerful meds. Eli Lilly has nine obesity and diabetes drugs in development which could add even more health benefits to its portfolio of medications. These experimental treatments include a weight loss pill, orforglipron. The pill is currently in a phase 3 trial — its results will readout next year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. Eli Lilly is also testing a strong GLP-1 injection, retatrutide, which in a clinical trial helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks. Novo Nordisk is testing a weight loss pill of its own, amycretin. Novo Nordisk said that in a trial, patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. The Danish pharma company is also developing a more potent obesity treatment called CagriSema. This new drug combines semaglutide with amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists. Amylin helps regulate blood sugar levels, similar to GLP-1, while calcitonin controls calcium levels in the blood. Results for two late-stage trials of the drug are expected this year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts. Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market. READ ALSO: Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks and 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows. Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace. Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop. Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves. Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions. According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.” When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million. Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves. According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward. With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. Our Methodology To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the top technology companies, having made a name for itself in developing and supplying semiconductor devices. While Nvidia is a leader in artificial intelligence graphics, Broadcom is making a mark on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) The company is gaining traction in a growing market and currently produces the top ASICs used by businesses needing general-purpose AI chips, such as large tech companies like Meta and Alphabet. J.P. Morgan projects the addressable market for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s custom AI chips could reach $150 billion over the next four to five years, thanks to the company’s pioneering efforts in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s business growth. More precisely, Broadcom stated in June that it was expected to sell over $11 billion worth of AI chips this year. The company’s AI-focused chip sales more than tripled to $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Not only is that incredible year-over-year growth, but Broadcom’s AI sales accounted for an impressive 24% of the company’s sales in the quarter, total revenue totalling $13.1 billion. During the earnings call, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) CEO Hock Tan stated that “customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters” and that the demand for custom AI accelerators is still growing. As chip customers keep returning for more, the company should generate more revenue and earnings to return to shareholders. Here is what Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also performed well during the quarter, as the company reported better-than-expected earnings, with an upside from demand related to AI. This long-term holding is strongly positioned to benefit from continued AI demand, with AI sales in the quarter up 400% over the prior year. Overall, AI-related revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2024 and is on pace to represent a majority of the company’s revenue within two to three years.” Overall AVGO ranks 4th on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure. Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further. During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value. AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings. Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings. Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access. First of all, we need to consider the implications of home inspectors, employed in part by BlackRock and Vanguard investments, surveying the damage and assessing the value of hurricane-stricken North Carolina—especially because of the vast lithium deposits in the ground beneath and around these private properties. According to Straits Research, a major market analyst, the demand for lithium is going to explode over the next few years: The global lithium market size was valued at USD 38.2 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of USD 230.4 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 22.1% during the forecast period (2023-2031). This is a more than 500% increase in less than a decade. Here’s this, from a report less than two weeks ago; Albemarle, a major lithium producer, is pursuing lithium production in North Carolina. Earlier this year, it announced plans to reopen the resource-rich lithium Kings Mountain mine in the state by the end of 2026, supported by $150 million in DoE funding. However, it has faced backlash from environmentalists and indigenous groups looking to block the development, which has led to delays. Albemarle is looking to expand its domestic lithium production. And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain.

And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain.

Title: Industry Veteran Jeff Sagansky Rebukes Hollywood Studios for Decisions Leading to ‘Unbelievable Cataclysm in the Business’

TheGrill 2024: Sagansky and Peter Guber debate the transformative shift caused by the end of TV profits and rise of streaming ambitions Investor Jeff Sagansky took Hollywood to task for decisions that have led to a massive destruction of value and are causing an “unbelievable cataclysm in the business,” speaking in a keynote interview at TheWrap’s Grill conference on Tuesday. “You’re seeing the traditional business collapse,” he said in a conversation with entertainment entrepreneur Peter Guber and TheWrap’s editor in chief Sharon Waxman. “And at the same time, you’re seeing all this predatory behavior from the streamers and the two of them together are causing unbelievable cataclysm in the business that we both love.” Sagansky accused Hollywood’s traditional studios of accelerating the decline of linear television by choosing to abandon programming in favor of streaming platforms, which led to what he called “predatory” behavior from streamers. “It’s still [a] $150 billion value business in terms of revenues,” he added, noting that major sports like the NBA, MLB and NFL alone represent a $40 billion business, much smaller by contrast. Sagansky also predicted that the four leading streamers — Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney/Hulu and Max — would form an entertainment oligopoly that is likely to draw scrutiny from government regulators. Sagansky highlighted a total loss of $190 billion in value in the stock prices of major entertainment companies including Warner Bros Discovery, Disney and Paramount, noting that television, the traditional driver of the entertainment industry for half a century, has lost “almost half” of its audience. Guber, another Hollywood veteran and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment and the Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner, noted that amid mass layoffs, steep cuts in production, and an anxious search for streaming profitability, there’s more uncertainty in Hollywood than ever. “There will be blood, just like the movie, but there will also be opportunity,” Guber said. “Don’t give up on entertainment. It’s been around for thousands of years. It’s not going to go away in 2025.” During the conversation, Sagansky said he is still astounded by how entertainment companies got to this point: by pushing their film and TV libraries to Netflix in response to the decline of the DVD market in the late 2000s and early 2010s. “When streaming starts, people have a choice they can make, and they make it. So what does cable do? They raised the prices. They produced less programming at a time when the building was on fire,” Sagansky said. “They just looked at their cash cow and said ‘OK, it’s over,’ and that was a fundamental mistake.” While there are differences between live sports and the rest of entertainment, Guber believes there’s one key similarity to finding success in both worlds: find a position as the bridge between artist and audience. As part of the ownership groups behind the Dodgers and Warriors, he sees those teams’ venues — the new Chase Center in San Francisco and the venerable Dodger Stadium in L.A. — as “cathedrals” that foster generational connections between teams and fans. And he said he tries to make those venues into places that people feel active in the story being told during the game. “You have to find your way through, to be active in your own rescue,” Guber said. “Don’t wait just for the government to give you a clear path. Create your own path. If you don’t, you will be on the dustbin of history.” Sagansky and Guber also discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence on filmmaking and whether it will expand or curtail opportunities for filmmakers. To see that debate, check out the clip above. (Full interview to follow.) During Tuesday’s TheGrill, five other business panels tackled different aspects of AI in Hollywood. In a panel focused on how to balance “innovation and ethics” actor and director Justine Bateman said AI would “burn the industry to the ground” by eliminating numerous job functions, which Edouard Harris, CTO of Gladstone AI, predicted that Hollywood would break off into a two-pronged system of those supporting and not supporting AI implementation. In another panel moderated by Waxman, Fox Corp. CTO Melody Hildebrandt called on the industry to take a long view on AI and be “peers to big tech in the exploitation of it.” And in a spotlight conversation, Jeffrey Bennett, SAG-AFTRA’s general counsel, broke down the timeline for what needs to happen for AI protections to be adopted nationwide. And in an afternoon session about balancing the protection of creative rights with opportunities, Alexandra Shannon, head of strategic development at CAA, detailed the creation of theCAAvault to store actors’ likenesses for use in other AI-generated applications with legal consent. Not all the day’s event dealt with AI. Two panels featured top journalists like former New York Times staffer Laura Holson, Oliver Darcy and former LA Times Executive Director Kevin Merida, discussing the state of the media industry. And in a session centered on redefining success in sports and business, WNBA Champion Sue Bird and soccer legend Megan Rapinoe, along with Olympic gymnast Nastia Liukin, discussed how mainstream traction for women’s sports continues to be met with gaslighting and industry resistance. “The goalpost is moving,” Rapinoe said.

ERIC KIM Just buy Bitcoin and/or Microstrategy stock (MSTR) First, it seems that making money is best and easiest and also most straightforward, and also has much more upside potential if you’re investing, trading, etc. So what is super interesting is if you want to create real wealth, and make a shitload of money, the market… getting an initial public offering, to be on the public traded market and stock market is your best bet. For example, all the wealthiest people on the planet, it is all universally through their stock options: For example Elon Musk has a net worth of $270 billion, as he holds approximately 13% of Tesla, and his shares are worth at around $821, making his Tesla holdings around $187 billion. Jeff Bezos is $204 billion, as he owns about 10% of Amazon. Assuming that Amazon is trading at around $130 per year, his Amazon share are worth approximately $130 billion. Also a shock I haven’t researched this in a long time, Apple is currently worth $3.43 trillion, and Nvidia at a surprising 3.13 trillion! Even super lame Microsoft, 3.04 trillion! Essentially the reason why this is Social shocking to me is that even in my lifetime as a kid until now… To become a millionaire was supposed to be the dream a big deal, now it is centi billionaire — example, Elon Musk has $270 billion! Blows my mind! The reason why bitcoin is by far the most Apex potential upside on the planet ,,, cause assuming that bitcoin is the first true money, the first true digital money, money perfected, and also because it is the biggest technology innovation of our time, then if that is the case, it should become the most valuable thing for the human race of all time. Once JP Morgan Chase starts to custody bitcoin, the price will explode! JPMorgan Chase has recently shared a positive outlook on Bitcoin’s performance for October 2024, referring to a seasonal trend often called “Uptober,” where Bitcoin typically sees a strong month of gains.

This trend, coupled with recent macroeconomic shifts, including anticipated impacts from the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum through Q4 .

US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after Monday's losses, with momentum revived by a tech rally and falling crude prices. The Magnificent 7 tech cohort led the market higher, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chipmaker climbed 4% on Tuesday, while Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft all traded more than 1% higher. The surge in oil prices that pressured stocks on Monday, meanwhile, retraced, with international and US crude prices falling more than 4%. Energy traders pulled back on Monday as they continued to await retaliation from Israel over Iran's missile barrage last week, while a disappointing stimulus update in China weighed on the outlook for oil demand. In the US, Wall Street is keeping an eye on the upcoming consumer price index report for September. The inflation data will publish on Thursday, and will inform investors what to expect from the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in November. Though the market had been anticipating another half-point interest rate cut next month, last Friday's big jobs report erased those forecasts. Bank of America expects any upside surprise in the inflation data may keep rates higher for longer. At the same time, Fed officials have cited optimistic expectations for rate cuts to continue. On Monday, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times that a quarter-point cut is a "very good base case." Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. Tuesday's session also marked the start of earnings season. In a new report, BofA noted that the bar for third-quarter earnings is low, adding that investors will likely reward firms as long as they express confidence about lower rates. Major US financial firms, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, report results on Friday. Among Tuesday's notable movers was Roblox, which briefly fell nearly 10% in intraday trading, after short-seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the gaming platform. Meanwhile, China's sharp equity rally showed signs of slowing down. Beijing's failure to announce new stimulus plans on Tuesday has disappointed investors.

Title: What went wrong at CVS?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Pharmacy chains are in crisis The pharmacy industry is in crisis. That's especially true at CVS, where layoffs are piling on top of layoffs — and the future of the company is in question. CVS Health announced this month that it is laying off 2,000 workers, CNN said, as part of an effort to "slash costs" across the company. That's on top of the 5,000 layoffs it announced last year, and after the company closed around 900 stores in recent years. CVS and other drug store chains are "struggling" due to falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, CNN said. "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations," said a company spokesperson. CVS' problems are also "very specific to the company," said Axios. In addition to its pharmacies, CVS is also a "major insurer" — it bought Aetna in 2017 — as well as a pharmacy benefit manager. Yes, "retail pharmacy in general is struggling," but CVS' challenges "could just be the specific businesses it has combined," Axios said. That's why company leaders are reportedly considering breaking up those businesses — an extraordinary move in an era where "vertical integration is all the rage." Escape your echo chamber.

"Satisfaction with brick-and-mortar pharmacies dropped 10 points in 2024," said Time. Customers report short-staffed outlets with "long lines and frustrating experiences." It's not just CVS: Rite Aid recently emerged from bankruptcy, and Walgreens is planning to close one-fourth of its roughly 8,600 stores. Customers simply didn't return to brick-and-mortar stores after the pandemic, preferring cheaper online alternatives. "The current pharmacy model is not sustainable," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in June. That affects communities. The mass closure of retail pharmacies is a "growing worry for health experts," said the Missouri Independent. The problem is "most acute" in places with low incomes — "urban cores" and rural areas where pharmacies are the "convenience stores of the health care system." That makes getting necessary medications a growing challenge for the people who live in those places. "When those community pharmacies close, communities lose critical access," said one expert. One other factor in the struggles of CVS and its industry: "Heavy competition" from Amazon and Walmart, said the Los Angeles Times. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) also play a role — they have "significant control" over how much insurers pay pharmacies for medications and have worked to push down those reimbursement costs. That pushes down pharmacy profitability. One irony: CVS owns Caremark, a PBM. "That's made the drug retail business more healthy," said one analyst — but it still hasn't made CVS "immune to market forces," said the Times. CVS' board is looking at "splitting the company," said The Wall Street Journal. That could be difficult. The spun-off businesses "might struggle to flourish on their own." The mergers with Aetna and Caremark were supposed to "bring down costs and give patients more convenient, accessible care." That didn't pan out. Now the future of the company is in limbo, the Journal said: CVS' board "isn't expected to make a decision soon."

Title: FAANG and data center stocks are a buy to cash in on AI's next phase, strategist says

Tejas Dessai, director of research at Global X, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): The chairman of Foxconn said the AI boom “still has time to go.” Chip makers such as Nvidia are up on the news today. Where do you see the next phase of artificial intelligence expansion coming from? TEJAS DESSAI (TD): We expect it to play out in several phases. Currently, the first phase focuses on building the infrastructure that is needed to run, train, and deploy these AI models. And in this particular phase, clearly, you need semiconductors that are specialized — the chips that Nvidia (NVDA) provides or companies like AMD (AMD) or Intel (INTC) are even trying to provide. Now, on the other hand, you have companies like Broadcom (AVGO) that want to participate in this revolution through ASIC-type chips. There’s a wide area of other chips, as well. But beyond that, we also anticipate the broader data center industry being very well positioned here, as that infrastructure build-out happens at a very large scale, as well. So it’s clearly still early days in this revolution; we expect a large number of companies within the semiconductor value chain to participate in this. But beyond that, you have the hyperscalers with their own play. You have the data center operators and then, eventually, a much broader area of network infrastructure that will play a role in bringing these AI systems to the common masses. AM: Data centers are going to be a big part of the next phase of AI. What companies do you see taking advantage of it? TD: What’s happening now is you are seeing an increasing mix of AI-specific workloads come into the data center equation. And AI workloads are extremely computer-intensive. They’re energy-intensive. They need a very different kind of memory, very different kind of storage systems, very different kind of networking solutions, cooling systems, power requirements. So it’s really a breadth of innovation that we are seeing here with companies participating in this across the spectrum. In the first phase, obviously, you’re starting to see the semiconductor players benefit from this. But as we see more and more AI clusters being deployed, you could see an uptake in memory solutions, in storage solutions, in networking solutions. And you have companies across the spectrum there that play into that equation. And from there on, we expect companies that specialize in providing comprehensive data center solutions — complete clusters of AI that the average S&P 500 enterprise can leverage. So you talk about data center operators like Equinix (EQIX) or Digital Realty (DLR) or Next DC and several others around the world, we expect these companies to be able to participate in this revolution through infrastructure provisioning. At the same time, you have your traditional hyperscalers, the FAANG names that build these massive computing facilities and really sell that capacity through their cloud franchises. You have Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) for sure, Google (GOOGL) Cloud, even companies like IBM (IBM) benefiting from that revolution. As they see incremental growth within their cloud franchises, they will be compelled to invest more significantly in building this infrastructure, which, again, benefits a large area of component providers in that list. AM: Gotcha. So a big driver in economic growth over the last couple of years has been these big tech companies — their stocks are way up. Would you recommend that investors continue to invest in Big Tech going into the fourth quarter and beyond into 2025? TD: Our advice to our clients has been to focus on adding exposure to the ancillary areas around this new revolution that is forming. Data centers are obviously top of mind. You need to have some sort of exposure to the entire data center value chain if you want to participate within the AI revolution. Beyond that, you can look at the consumer semiconductor ecosystem. You can look at cloud computing ecosystem because ultimately you will see a large breadth of these technology companies participating in this cycle and benefiting from that growth, as well. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia notches fifth day of gains as Wall Street stays bullish on AI

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 4% in Tuesday, notching its fifth straight day of gains. Wall Street analysts at KeyBanc, Citi (C), Bernstein, and several other investment firms reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week. KeyBanc analysts raised their fiscal year 2025 sales outlook for Nvidia from $128.5 billion to $130.6 billion, with Nvidia’s new flagship Blackwell AI chips contributing $7 billion to fourth quarter revenues. That’s higher than Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $125.6 billion for 2025 revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Even as production of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia’s prior AI chip models — H100s and H200s — “remains extremely robust.” Nvidia shares are up nearly 14% over the past week and 190% from last year. Wedbush analysts said “another positive data point” for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI’s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI-related startups would, in turn, fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication "that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit." Nvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to show that it’s more than just a chipmaker. Adding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's (2354.TW) new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that Foxconn is building the world’s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is “crazy” demand for Nvidia’s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia’s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions. Nvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer. Nvidia isn’t the only semiconductor company that’s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].” The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China’s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market’s hope for more stimulus measures, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%. Investors had expected stimulus initiatives to boost China’s semiconductor sector. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Even as production of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia’s prior AI chip models — H100s and H200s — “remains extremely robust.” Nvidia shares are up 13% over the past week and 189% from last year. Wedbush analysts said “another positive data point” for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI’s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI related startups would in turn fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication "that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit." Nvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to prove it’s more than just a chipmaker. Adding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of electronics manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that it’s building the world’s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is “crazy” demand for Nvidia’s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia’s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions. Nvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer. Nvidia isn’t the only semiconductor company that’s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year. “We remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].” The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday. Meanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China’s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market’s hope for more stimulus measures, China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%. Investors had expected stimulus initiatives to boost China’s semiconductor sector. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: WeightWatchers is getting in on the off-brand GLP-1 game — and it's cheap

Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know WeightWatchers (WW) announced Tuesday that it is now offering off-brand weight loss drugs for one of the cheapest prices in the industry. WeightWatchers, the once-popular points-based weight loss program, said it will be offering its members compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of the active ingredient in Ozempic (NVO) and Wegovy — for $129 for the first month and then $189 a month for the subsequent months. That’s hundreds of dollars cheaper than Wegovy’s $1,349 monthly price tag. “At WeightWatchers, we have always combined proven science and personalized support to help our members achieve meaningful, lasting results. With the addition of compounded semaglutide, we are expanding our offering to include a clinical weight management solution that is both accessible and affordable,” said Tara Comonte, interim CEO of WeightWatchers, in a press release. WeightWatchers stock surged 25% following the news. This offering comes just a week after Comonte replaced outgoing CEO Sima Sistani in late September. Sistani departed the company as it struggled to adapt to the growing popularity of weight loss drugs. Sistani joined WeightWatchers in 2022 and led the company for about two-and-a-half years. Under her leadership, WeightWatchers acquired the the telehealth platform Sequence and started offering WeightWatchers members branded weight loss drugs such as Wegovy. But the bet hasn’t seemed to pay off yet. WeightWatchers’ stock is down more than 88% since the beginning of the year. The class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 treatments have been putting pressure on WeightWatchers. These drugs, which mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY), the pharmaceutical giants behind popular GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively, have seen their stock prices soar as a result. Novo Nordisk stock has climbed 27% over the past 12 months, while Eli Lilly shares have surged 61%. WeightWatchers joins other digital health care companies including Hims & Hers, Noom, and Sesame in offering cheaper alternatives to branded weight loss drugs. Typically, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications — compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand-name drugs such as Wegovy has spurred several digital health care companies to take advantage of that provision. However, there are risks. The FDA said in July that it had received reports of overdoses related to weight loss drugs, often due to confusion over proper dosing. And companies hawking compounded weight loss drugs may have to stop when the shortages end. Last week, the FDA updated its drug shortage database, marking the shortage of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound as resolved. Wegovy remains on the list.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose on Tuesday after Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, touted strong demand for artificial intelligence servers. Executives at Foxconn—officially named Hon Hai Precision Industry—said Tuesday at the company's annual tech day they were constructing in Mexico the world’s largest facility for assembling AI servers to house Nvidia’s GB200 chips, part of its Blackwell AI architecture. Young Liu, chair of Foxconn, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that the company is aiming to produce 20,000 GB200 NVL72 servers at the factory in 2025. HSBC analysts have estimated the price of one GB200 NVL72 server is about $3 million. Demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell system is “awfully huge,” said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn’s senior vice president of cloud enterprise solutions, at the company’s tech day. Liu told Bloomberg demand was “crazy,” echoing comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last week. Nvidia stock climbed more than 4% Tuesday, extending gains from yesterday when the company overtook Microsoft (MSFT) as America’s second-most valuable company. The stock, which closed just under $133 on Tuesday, is approaching its record closing high of $135.57, which was set on June 18. Nvidia's all-time intraday high, set on June 20, is $140.76. TradingView Nvidia shares have more than doubled this year after rebounding from a summer slump amid reports that a design flaw would delay the rollout of the Blackwell system. Those reports coincided with a sell-off of big tech stocks as earnings disappointed and Wall Street questioned the wisdom of massive AI spending. Update—October 8, 2024: This story has been updated to reflect Nvidia's share price at the market close on Tuesday.

The bank's recent third-quarter 2024 earnings report exceeded analyst expectations, with net income rising to $13.7 billion, up 8% from the previous quarter. This strong performance was driven by solid consumer banking results and increased net interest income due to higher interest rates.

JPMorgan's recent expansion of its middle-market banking services in Europe has begun to yield results, with the bank gaining market share in a traditionally underserved segment.

The bank's strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 14.5% as of the third quarter of 2024, provides a solid foundation for growth and resilience against economic uncertainties. This strong capital base has allowed JPMorgan to increase its dividend by 5% in 2024, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend growth. As the Federal Reserve signals a potential end to its rate-hiking cycle, JPMorgan is well-positioned to benefit from a stable interest rate environment. The bank's diversified business model, spanning consumer banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking and asset and wealth management, provides resilience against sector-specific downturns. JPMorgan's strong risk management practices, evidenced by its performance during recent banking sector turbulence, and its "fortress balance sheet" philosophy instill confidence in its ability to weather potential economic headwinds. With signs of financial stability emerging and the potential for a "soft landing" scenario, JPMorgan benefits from increased lending activity and potential upticks in consumer spending and business investments.

Title: Inside Economics: Ready for OCR cuts, today’s the day... plus, could petrol prices and AI bubbles ruin the economic recovery?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. OPINION Welcome to Inside Economics. Every week, I take a deeper dive into some of the more left-field economic news you may have missed. To sign up to my weekly newsletter, click here. If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market. The RBNZ gets another shot in November with a full Monetary Policy Statement and if it cuts by 50 bps then as well, that would send us into the new year with an OCR at 4.25%. Economists are picking the rate will fall further next year, so there is more relief on the way. ASB expects the OCR will be down to 4% by February 2025 and will reach a terminal rate of 3.25% from around mid-2025. KiwiBank economists say market traders are putting “odds-on” bets of 50 bps cuts all the way through until February. “The cash rate is priced to hit 3% by August next year, with a terminal rate around 2.5%, in line with our forecast,” they said. So there is no question relief is on its way ... it’s just a question of how fast. Check-in on the nzherald.co.nz site at 2pm for the decision and analysis. That’s my favourite question about the economy. It’s more of a prelude to a range of questions, but it draws on the seemingly endless well of pessimism that economics inspires. If things are going well, we can worry that the only way from here is down. If things are going badly, we can worry about our capacity to cope with any more bad news. Remarkably, things are going pretty well for the global economy right now. There is a chance that this optimism will flow through to New Zealand as interest rates start to fall. As discussed last week, the US economy is on a roll - its annual economic growth rate has recovered to 3% and at the weekend we saw its latest job creation data (the quirkily named non-farm payrolls) showed a big surprise on the upside. It looks like the US will avoid recession, giving the US Federal Reserve breathing space to cut rates in a measured fashion. This comes alongside a struggling Chinese economy that has already boosted iron ore prices, which will give Australia’s economy a shot in the arm. Hopefully, the stimulus will lift Chinese consumer sentiment too, which could boost prices for dairy and our other food exports like meat, wine and fruit. We might even see a much-needed lift in the number of Chinese tourists to New Zealand. So what, if anything, could derail this positive economic outlook? Since the conflict in the Middle East broadened to include Lebanon and Iran, oil prices have spiked about 10%. That’s a concern for those still worried about the tail end of inflation - not to mention being a pain for drivers who were just starting to enjoy the benefits of lower prices at the pump. Brent crude - the variety of oil that New Zealand petrol prices are pinned to - spiked above US$81 ($131) on Tuesday after the latest strikes by Israel and Hezbollah. It’s safe to say you’ll be paying more to fill up the tank this weekend. But it’s worth keeping the spike in context. It takes us back to where we were in August and we’re still a long way off this year’s high of US$90.38. Obviously, a wider war between Israel and Iran would be a disaster for the world. We’ve seen Iran launch a large-scale but ineffective missile attack against Israel and now the world is waiting on Israel’s response. The stakes are high and it’s an awful situation for the region. It would be foolish to try to pick how it all plays out. But essentially there is a binary way of looking at the economic risk. Either we’ll see an expansion of Israel’s conflict with Iran or we won’t. If Israel can be convinced (and there will be a lot of US lobbying going on) to respond in a measured way, perhaps this part of the current conflict will settle down. If that’s the case, we could see oil prices slide back as the rest of the conflict - as terrible as it all is - has less direct impact on oil supply. Iran is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, though half of its exports go to China. If a serious and sustained conflict breaks out between Iran and Israel, there is a risk oil prices could spike back above US$100. They rose to $US130 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These are different times though. Broadly, oil prices have been coming down over the past year, mostly due to subdued demand, with both the US and Chinese economies being sluggish. As these economies rebound we should expect oil prices to rise, regardless of the Middle East situation. The big variable in all of this is OPEC+, which still controls 40% of global supply. That’s enough that it can shift the price significantly depending on how much oil it decides to produce. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in OPEC+ and that gives it significant political sway. It’s one of the reasons the US maintains such friendly relations with the Saudis. So far it has played a neutral hand, neither boosting nor cutting production. Good news for human readers: if MIT economist Daron Acemoglu is to be believed, AI is unlikely to be able to replace more than 5% of jobs in the next decade. There, bad news for humans with KiwiSaver accounts, though, as Acemoglu is a leading voice among a growing camp of sceptics who believe AI hype has created a bubble that will likely cause a stock market crash. AI stocks - like chip maker Nvidia - have been very good to KiwiSaver funds over the past few years. Nvidia shares were worth US$12 in October 2022. Today they are worth US$125. Acemoglu, who says he is not anti-AI or even pessimistic about its long-term prospects, hit the headlines last week with his big call about the low level of jobs that AI can actually do. The Herald picked up the coverage from the Washington Post (read the full article here). It’s probably worth mentioning that 5% of jobs is still a lot of jobs. That would effectively double our unemployment rate to 10% if it happened overnight. But as promising as AI is for many things, there’s little chance it will live up to that hype, Acemolu says. “A lot of money is going to get wasted,” he says. “You’re not going to get an economic revolution out of that 5%.” He notes that four companies alone - Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms - invested more than US$50 billion into capital spending in the second quarter of this year, with much of that going towards AI. Having lived through the dotcom crash in 2000, I’ve been bothered by the risks of an AI bubble for some time (even as I’ve watched it pump my KiwiSaver account). I remain ever hopeful that we might see pricing levels rebalance in an orderly fashion as investors switch out of tech stocks and into more mainstream companies that will benefit as interest rates fall. But that’s seldom how market bubbles resolve themselves. Usually, things are much more dramatic. Acemoglu sees three scenarios - a best case, a bad case and a worst case. The best we can hopeful is the kind of gradual deflation and rebalancing of valuations, he says. There have been promising signs of this in the past few months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange, home to Nvidia, has risen just 1.2% in the past six months. In fact, it is down about 4% since its most recent peak - just before August’s “flash crash” market sell-off. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 - full of more traditional companies - has hit a series of record highs in the past couple of weeks. But the Nasdaq is still up 40% in the past year and 130% since 2019. If investors get spooked, there is still enough air in there to deflate rapidly. In Acemoglu’s second scenario, the AI hype keeps rolling for another year or so, leading to a tech stock crash that burns off corporate enthusiasm for the technology. “AI spring followed by AI winter,” he says. But there’s a third, even worse scenario. As the Washington Post puts it: “The mania goes unchecked for years, leading companies to cut scores of jobs and pump hundreds of billions of dollars into AI without understanding what they’re going to do with it, only to be left scrambling to try to rehire workers when the technology doesn’t pan out.” That could have widespread fallout for the entire global economy, Acemoglu says. Ominously, he sees a combination of the second and third scenarios as most likely. But not this year at least! US political mayhem might be a more pressing risk. As mentioned above, America’s economy has been humming along nicely. Could the upcoming election derail that? There is plenty of commentary highlighting the risks with both presidential candidates. On balance, there is probably more concern about Donald Trump and his plans for 10% tariffs on all imports, although it depends on who you ask. Elon Musk seems more concerned about Kamala Harris’ tax plans and ambitions to rein in the tech sector with price controls and other regulations. If we strip out the partisan political takes, the one big risk that remains is around an uncertain or contested election result. If we don’t get a clear result on the night, we will face weeks of recounts or even months of uncertainty if things end up going through the courts. That seems likely given how close the polling is and how high the stakes are. Markets famously hate uncertainty. Wall Street is likely to cope with either a Trump or Harris presidency. But a power vacuum for any significant length of time might be enough to spook investors and derail the current rally. This year’s Mood of the Boardroom survey of chief executives and directors showed a surge of optimism about the economic outlook from here. But one thing they weren’t so upbeat about was New Zealand’s recent economic performance. As I wrote for Inside Economics back in August, the idea of a “hard” or “soft” landing refers to whether policymakers can bring down inflation by lifting interest rates without putting the economy into recession. On that definition, New Zealand has had a hard landing. If the Reserve Bank forecasts are correct, we are currently in our third recession in two years. But interestingly, when business leaders were asked what they thought, the results weren’t a slam dunk. Some 65% gave a hard “no” to the suggestion we might have managed a soft landing. Around 20% were unsure and 15% said yes. Mitigating factors might include that the recessions so far have been shallow (albeit propped up by high net migration). Unemployment is still below 5%, a historically low level. And despite some grim headlines and high-profile business failures, the stats for credit arrears, mortgagee sales and business liquidations remain lower than they were during the GFC and the years immediately after it. There’s no question it’s a tough economy right now. But the long-term damage the period does will ultimately depend on how many jobs are lost and how many businesses fail. Here’s hoping the recovery rolls on smoothly from here and we escape with something that might still be described as “softish”. Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the New Zealand Herald.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. OPINION Welcome to Inside Economics. Every week, I take a deeper dive into some of the more left-field economic news you may have missed. To sign up to my weekly newsletter, click here. If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market. The RBNZ gets another shot in November with a full Monetary Policy Statement and if it cuts by 50 bps then as well, that would send us into the new year with an OCR at 4.25%. Economists are picking the rate will fall further next year, so there is more relief on the way. ASB expects the OCR will be down to 4% by February 2025 and will reach a terminal rate of 3.25% from around mid-2025. KiwiBank economists say market traders are putting “odds-on” bets of 50 bps cuts all the way through until February. “The cash rate is priced to hit 3% by August next year, with a terminal rate around 2.5%, in line with our forecast,” they said. So there is no question relief is on its way ... it’s just a question of how fast. Check-in on the nzherald.co.nz site at 2pm for the decision and analysis. That’s my favourite question about the economy. It’s more of a prelude to a range of questions, but it draws on the seemingly endless well of pessimism that economics inspires. If things are going well, we can worry that the only way from here is down. If things are going badly, we can worry about our capacity to cope with any more bad news. Remarkably, things are going pretty well for the global economy right now. There is a chance that this optimism will flow through to New Zealand as interest rates start to fall. As discussed last week, the US economy is on a roll - its annual economic growth rate has recovered to 3% and at the weekend we saw its latest job creation data (the quirkily named non-farm payrolls) showed a big surprise on the upside. It looks like the US will avoid recession, giving the US Federal Reserve breathing space to cut rates in a measured fashion. This comes alongside a struggling Chinese economy that has already boosted iron ore prices, which will give Australia’s economy a shot in the arm. Hopefully, the stimulus will lift Chinese consumer sentiment too, which could boost prices for dairy and our other food exports like meat, wine and fruit. We might even see a much-needed lift in the number of Chinese tourists to New Zealand. So what, if anything, could derail this positive economic outlook? Since the conflict in the Middle East broadened to include Lebanon and Iran, oil prices have spiked about 10%. That’s a concern for those still worried about the tail end of inflation - not to mention being a pain for drivers who were just starting to enjoy the benefits of lower prices at the pump. Brent crude - the variety of oil that New Zealand petrol prices are pinned to - spiked above US$81 ($131) on Tuesday after the latest strikes by Israel and Hezbollah. It’s safe to say you’ll be paying more to fill up the tank this weekend. But it’s worth keeping the spike in context. It takes us back to where we were in August and we’re still a long way off this year’s high of US$90.38. Obviously, a wider war between Israel and Iran would be a disaster for the world. We’ve seen Iran launch a large-scale but ineffective missile attack against Israel and now the world is waiting on Israel’s response. The stakes are high and it’s an awful situation for the region. It would be foolish to try to pick how it all plays out. But essentially there is a binary way of looking at the economic risk. Either we’ll see an expansion of Israel’s conflict with Iran or we won’t. If Israel can be convinced (and there will be a lot of US lobbying going on) to respond in a measured way, perhaps this part of the current conflict will settle down. If that’s the case, we could see oil prices slide back as the rest of the conflict - as terrible as it all is - has less direct impact on oil supply. Iran is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, though half of its exports go to China. If a serious and sustained conflict breaks out between Iran and Israel, there is a risk oil prices could spike back above US$100. They rose to $US130 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These are different times though. Broadly, oil prices have been coming down over the past year, mostly due to subdued demand, with both the US and Chinese economies being sluggish. As these economies rebound we should expect oil prices to rise, regardless of the Middle East situation. The big variable in all of this is OPEC+, which still controls 40% of global supply. That’s enough that it can shift the price significantly depending on how much oil it decides to produce. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in OPEC+ and that gives it significant political sway. It’s one of the reasons the US maintains such friendly relations with the Saudis. So far it has played a neutral hand, neither boosting nor cutting production. Good news for human readers: if MIT economist Daron Acemoglu is to be believed, AI is unlikely to be able to replace more than 5% of jobs in the next decade. There, bad news for humans with KiwiSaver accounts, though, as Acemoglu is a leading voice among a growing camp of sceptics who believe AI hype has created a bubble that will likely cause a stock market crash. AI stocks - like chip maker Nvidia - have been very good to KiwiSaver funds over the past few years. Nvidia shares were worth US$12 in October 2022. Today they are worth US$125. Acemoglu, who says he is not anti-AI or even pessimistic about its long-term prospects, hit the headlines last week with his big call about the low level of jobs that AI can actually do.

That would effectively double our unemployment rate to 10% if it happened overnight.

Title: Microsoft's Stock Has One Fewer 'Buy' Rating on Wall Street Today

Optimism about AI-related growth has helped shares of Microsoft (MSFT) this year, but at least one investment bank is urging caution about what might come next. Oppenheimer analysts on Tuesday downgraded shares of Microsoft to “perform” from “outperform.” That's rare on Wall Street, with nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the software giant holding "buy" or equivalent ratings, according to Visible Alpha. Shares of Microsoft were recently up about 1%, slightly outperforming the broader market. The stock is up more than 11% for the year. "Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling," the analysts wrote Tuesday. Open AI is an independent company, but it has a "strategic partnership" with Microsoft. “Enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint.” In a September report, Oppenheimer said it was “tweaking down near term AI revenue, but tweaking up CapEx spending, mostly for Microsoft.” The company is investing in "once-in-a-generation technology," the analysts wrote, so "we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority.” Oppenheimer also said that Microsoft's shares are trading near the midpoint of the five-year range for its price-to-earnings ratio and "could trade to the lower end" down the line.

Title: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?

The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a "buy" or "strong buy" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.

October 08, 2024 11:21 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA WASHINGTON, Oct. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA AI Summit — NVIDIA today announced it is teaming with U.S. technology leaders to help organizations create custom AI applications and transform the world’s industries using the latest NVIDIA NIM™ Agent Blueprints and NVIDIA NeMo™ and NVIDIA NIM microservices. Across industries, organizations like AT&T, Lowe’s and the University of Florida are using the microservices to create their own data-driven AI flywheels to power custom generative AI applications. U.S. technology consulting leaders Accenture, Deloitte, Quantiphi and SoftServe are adopting NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints and NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices to help clients in healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, financial services and retail create custom generative AI agents and copilots. Data and AI platform leaders Cadence, Cloudera, DataStax, Google Cloud, NetApp, SAP, ServiceNow and Teradata are advancing their data and AI platforms with NVIDIA NIM. “AI is driving transformation and shaping the future of global industries,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “In collaboration with U.S. companies, universities and government agencies, NVIDIA will help advance AI adoption to boost productivity and drive economic growth.” NVIDIA NeMo Microservices for Precision-Tailored Generative AINVIDIA NeMo microservices support end-to-end model customization workflows and the development of AI agents to help enterprises bring custom generative AI applications to market faster, reducing development costs.

Title: Nvidia highlights AI software and services at D.C. AI Summit

Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for its highly coveted artificial intelligence chips. But at its Nvidia AI Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, the Nvidia vice president of Enterprise Platforms, Bob Pette, delivered an address providing greater insights into the company’s various software platforms. Nvidia says companies ranging from AT&T (T), Deloitte, and Quantiphi to research centers like the National Cancer Institute and the SETI Institute are using its software technologies to do everything from helping employees work through software development and network engineering jobs to searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. Nvidia has a number of AI software platforms including Nvidia NIM Agent Blueprints, Nvidia NIM, and Nvidia NeMo. NIM Agent Blueprints is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications, while NIM provides the ability to quickly put together chatbots and AI assistants. Nvidia NeMo gives companies the means to build their own custom generative AI models. Shares of Nvidia rose 3.7% following the announcement. The offerings are part of Nvidia’s strategy of ensuring that companies don’t just look to the company for AI processors but also for its software as well, driving additional revenue streams outside of hardware sales. According to Nvidia, AT&T is teaming with Quantiphi to create a conversational AI platform to assist employees with software development and financial services tasks. The University of Florida is using Nvidia’s NIM and MeMo to improve its learning management system for teaching assistants, and Deloitte is using Nvidia’s NIM Agent Blueprint alongside its own cybersecurity products. Nvidia says the National Cancer Institute is using NIM Agent Blueprint to help cut down on the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules, while the SETI Institute used the company’s Holoscan software development kit to create software for receiving and analyzing radio waves from space. Nvidia is also teaming with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of its new AI Tech Community initiative, establishing two new AI centers at the schools. The company says its Nvidia Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI will provide students, faculty, and researchers with technologies related to robotics and autonomy, while the Nvidia Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will revolve around AI focused on health sciences. Nvidia has developed the most sought-after AI chips in the world, which has sent its stock price skyrocketing a staggering 934% over the last two years. To put that in perspective, and maybe generate some envy, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2022, your stake would now be worth $103,400. But the company is facing increasing competition in the hardware space from longtime rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia’s own customers are also developing their own chips to power their AI software, which could cut into the company’s bottom line in the future. Nvidia’s endgame is to use software to hold on to its customers well into the future while providing recurring revenue streams. Highlighting its software also attracts developers to Nvidia’s offerings, and the more developers that build on Nvidia’s services, the more companies will seek out those platforms. Nvidia’s hardware lead isn’t going to disappear anytime soon, though. The company has been investing in AI technology for years, and it should continue to hold on to its competitive edge for some time. But by showing off its software, Nvidia is looking to prove it’s more than just a chip firm. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: One Wall Street Titan Thinks NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU Production Volume Will Hit A Whopping 750K – 800K Units By Q1’25

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Over the past few weeks, the tech news airwaves have become literally choked with speculation surrounding the production cadence of NVIDIA's latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell. While NVIDIA had already laid a lot of consternation to rest during its recent earnings call, when it confirmed that the architecture's minor design flaws were rectified via specific changes to the photomask, the true scale of the company's oncoming production ramp-up is only now becoming visible, with Morgan Stanley expecting a 3x jump in the Blackwell production volume between Q4'24 and Q1'25. As our discerning readers would remember, Morgan Stanley had penned an important note on NVIDIA back in September, noting among other things that the company was on course to ship 450,000 units of the Blackwell GPUs in the December-ending quarter, resulting in ~$10 billion in revenue. At the time, the Wall Street titan had conceded that NVIDIA was still in the process of resolving a few "technical challenges" with its GB200 server racks, positing a qualifier that such issues were a part of a "normal debugging process for new product launches." NVIDIA $NVDA Blackwell revenue could surpass Hopper as soon as Q1 2025, says Morgan Stanley: "According to our checks of the GPU testing supply chain, Blackwell chip output should be around 250-300k in Q4 2024, contributing $5-10 billion revenue for NVIDIA, which is still… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 8, 2024 Now, Morgan Stanley is out with a fresh investment note on NVIDIA, where the bank leverages its channel checks to confirm its earlier prognostication of between $5 billion and $10 billion in Blackwell-derived revenue for Q4'24. However, this time around, Morgan Stanley moves a step further by expounding on its thoughts for NVIDIA's first quarter of the calendar year 2025. Specifically, the Wall Street behemoth believes that NVIDIA will produce between 700,000 and 800,000 units of Blackwell GPUs in Q1'25, which corresponds to a 3x sequential increase in volumes: "And into 1Q25, we understand that Blackwell chip volume may reach 750k-800k units, up almost 3x from 4Q24." The bank goes on to note: "Meanwhile, we expect Hopper volume (including H200 and H20) to be around 1500k units in 4Q24, and gradually ramp down to 1000k units in 1Q25." Critically, given the fact that the B200 chip is priced at a 60 to 70 percent premium to the H200 chip, Morgan Stanley expects NVIDIA's Blackwell-derived revenues to exceed those related to its Hopper architecture in Q1'25.

Clark on Tuesday launched a new venture, called Auger, which aims to help companies and governments combine the mishmash of "Franken-software" overseeing their supply chains into a single platform. "At Flexport, I got to see all of these companies in the middle, like the Nikes or Lululemons, and I was amazed at how much of a struggle it is, and how much they still use Excel or Smartsheet or Tableau or something to bring all this disparate data together in such a way that they can do something," Clark said in an interview. "A shocking amount of supply chain still runs on Excel." Clark's third act follows a short but tumultuous stint at Flexport. Last September, Clark abruptly resigned as CEO of Flexport, allowing for the return of its founder, Ryan Petersen. Petersen claimed repeatedly that Clark overspent and overhired during his time at the freight forwarding startup. But documents viewed by CNBC, and sources close to Clark, showed that Petersen and members of Flexport's board helped implement decisions that Flexport has suggested were ill-advised. Petersen has since taken steps to turn around the business by overhauling its top ranks, implementing layoffs and subleasing excess warehouse space. Before Flexport, Clark developed a storied reputation during his 23 years at Amazon as the architect of its mammoth logistics network. He joined Amazon's operations division in 1999 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the most important executives at the company. In 2020, Amazon tapped Clark to head its core retail business after longtime executive Jeff Wilke left the company. Clark departed Amazon for Flexport in 2022. Clark joined Flexport to bring what he had built at Amazon to "small businesses and other businesses around the world." He left the startup feeling there was still a gap in the market for supply chain tools, and began to develop the idea behind Auger. The name is meant to convey the drilling tool's ability to break through things and dive deep. "I spent the last year with the chance to really sort of step back and think about the best way to tackle this problem," Clark said. "What do I want to do next? Do I still want to try to tackle this problem? Do I want to do something else? And I just kept coming back to, this should not be a problem for companies with the technology that exists in the world." He said a typical company might have "eight to 10 to 12 to 20" systems for procurement, forecasting, and enterprise resource planning. The systems can be clunky and are rarely integrated. He wanted to build a platform where companies could manage their supply chain with the "same level of simplicity and intuitiveness as the consumer applications that they use every day." Clark, who moved with his family to Texas before leaving Amazon, has returned to his former employer's backyard in Seattle to work on the new venture, which will be based in Bellevue, Washington. He hopes to pull from the area's deep bench of tech talent. Amazon last year rolled out its own supply chain management platform, which can handle the process of transporting businesses' goods from the manufacturer to customers' doorsteps. But the service is targeted at businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and use its logistics and fulfillment network. Auger's launch comes as venture deal volume has steadily declined over the past few years, aside from investments in artificial intelligence companies. U.S. venture capital exit value this year is expected to reach $98 billion, down 86% from 2021, according to an Aug. 29 report from PitchBook, while venture-backed IPOs are expected to be at their lowest since 2016. VC activity in the supply chain tech industry has shown recent improvement, although it's well below the levels seen in 2021 and 2022. Global investment in the space hit $2.4 billion, marking the third straight quarter of growth, according to Pitchbook. Auger has raised $100 million from venture firm Oak HC/FT. Clark said he soon expects to grow headcount to about 20 employees and intends to launch a "V1" product within nine months.

In January, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chief Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at Consumer Electronics Show 2025. The tech event will occur in Las Vegas from January 7-10, 2025. The event coincided with rumors of next-gen Nvidia GPUs appearing in 2025, the Verge reports. Nvidia could divulge an update about its RTX 50 series at CES, including its desktop GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture. Also Read: What’s Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday? Recently, Huang snubbed Wall Street concerns by indicating massive demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur flagged that the Blackwell GPU platform can support over 100 different system configurations, compared to the 19-20 options available with the prior generation Hopper GPU platform. According to Sur, Nvidia’s AI and accelerated compute moat will likely help it sustain growth into 2025 and beyond. Per the rumors, Nvidia may announce the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 simultaneously. At CES 2024, Nvidia showcased three new GPUs—the RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super for AI-ready laptops. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) voiced their conviction on AI personal computers (PCs) at the event, which contrasted with Nvidia’s focus on server-based AI. Nvidia stock is up over 182% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:VTI).

Title: Florida's real-estate market is on edge amid back-to-back hurricanes

Another hurricane is expected to hit Florida as the state continues recovering from Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton, a Category 4 storm (it weakened from a Category 5, but remains "extremely dangerous"), is on track to make landfall near Tampa Bay by Wednesday. It's the latest hurdle for the state's volatile real-estate market. Milton's peak wind speeds hit 160 mph on Monday. Heavy rain is expected before the storm arrives, and flooding is anticipated throughout the region. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued a state of emergency for 51 counties, and mandatory evacuations have begun in some areas. The mayor of Tampa, Jane Castor, has also issued a stark warning that anyone who remains in the city as Milton approaches will "die." It's never a good time for a hurricane to hit, but preparing for a powerful storm while you recover from another makes the situation even more challenging. Helene caused over 220 deaths and as much as $34 billion in damage, according to an estimate from Moody's Analytics. Meanwhile, federal agencies meant to provide emergency assistance, like FEMA and the Small Business Administration, face their own cash crises. Back-to-back hurricanes represent the latest problem for a real-estate market facing buyer's remorse. The threat and cost that hurricanes pose mean Florida homeowners have some reevaluating to do if they want to remain in the state, write Business Insider's Jordan Pandy, Dan Latu, and Madeline Berg. One homeowner told BI she pays $7,000 a year in flood and hazard insurance for her 1,400-square-foot bungalow just south of Tampa. (The policies paid off, her home was deemed uninhabitable after Helene, and she still wants to live there after it's repaired.) But those high costs, coupled with the annual fear of potentially losing your home every fall, have other residents throwing in the towel. Even a few insurers have called it quits on the state, while others could increase their prices by over 300% in the coming years. It's representative of the extremes the Sunshine State's real-estate market has faced in recent years. One of the pandemic's hottest markets, some people are now souring on Florida over its climate, costs, and overcrowding. (It's not alone in its post-pandemic comedown, as Texas is facing a similar fate.) But as much as people want to get out of the state, there will always be those looking to get in. More than 8,000 miles of coastline will do that. One Florida resident whose home sustained almost three feet of water damage from Helene cut their listing price by 40%. Within hours, their real-estate agent received 25 calls from investors interested in the property. Jump to

Title: This ‘Investing 101’ Advice Is A Mess When It Comes To Dividends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/10/08/this-investing-101-advice-is-a-mess-when-it-comes-to-dividends/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T12:05:00Z
Full Content:
The words "Investing 101" on a yellow legal pad Having a diversified portfolio is pretty much Investing 101, right? I mean, it’s one of the first things we all learn as investors. But there’s a problem here: Going for balance in “regular” stocks, bonds or ETFs can mean leaving income on the table. To see what I’m getting at here, check out the average yields on two ETFs many people buy for stock and bond exposure. For stocks, I likely don’t have to tell you about the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It’s the popular S&P 500 tracker. And it yields a microscopic 1.2%. There are plenty of options on the bond side, but let’s go with a fairly high-yielding ETF, the SPDR Bloomberg High-Yield Bond ETF (JNK). It holds the high-yield, or “junk,” bonds many investors (wrongly, as we’ll see in a moment) see as too risky. JNK yields 6.4%, which is obviously a lot better than 1.2%. But if you average the two together, you get just a 3.8% yield. Good news is, there’s an asset class out there that gives us the same level of diversification but with way more income: I’m talking 8%+ yields, with payouts often going out monthly. If you’ve been reading me for a while, or are a member of my CEF Insider service, you likely know where I’m heading next: to closed-end funds (CEFs), which yield around 8% on average as I write this. Below I’ve got three CEFs (one holding stocks, one holding high-yield bonds and one holding a nice stock-bond combo) that, when taken together, pay an average yield of 8.1%. Two of these funds pay dividends monthly, too. Let’s talk about them, starting with our equity CEF. As CEF Insider’s Investment Strategist, I’ve had plenty of occasions to speak to the staff at Adams Funds, sponsor of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). These conversations have always left me impressed. These people are professional, dedicated to shareholder value and committed to ensuring stable and reliable payouts. ADX, which yields 8.2% today, also gives us access to a level of institutional experience that’s very hard (if not impossible) to find elsewhere, inside or outside CEFs: The fund was launched in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression. That’s nearly a century of dealing with anything the market can throw at it. As we’ll see in a moment, the result of that long experience has been market-beating performance. A long-time knock on ADX is that up until earlier this year, it paid most of its dividend in as a one-time, year-end special payout that fluctuated according to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio). That caused some CEF investors to give ADX a pass in favor of monthly or quarterly paying funds. Management has now dealt with that issue: Under a change brought in earlier this year, ADX promises to pay no less than 2% of NAV per quarter, for an average 8% yield on NAV. That adds stability to the payout while still letting it ride with the value of the fund’s portfolio. So if you own SPY or one of its cousins now, consider swapping it out for ADX. You’ll get exposure to many of the same stocks, and ADX’s dividend policy means it essentially “converts” stock gains to dividends, giving you a solid income stream if you draw these funds off as cash. And if you reinvest your payouts, you get a real shot at beating the market. ADX has crushed SPY since we added it to the CEF Insider portfolio in July 2017: ADX Total Returns Now let’s talk discounts: As I write this, ADX trades at an 11.7% discount to NAV, meaning we get its portfolio of top-quality stocks, including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN), for around 88 cents on the dollar. ADX Discount NAV As you can see above, the discount narrowed to just below 7% earlier this year, on news of the new dividend policy. It has since fallen back, but as interest rates decline and investors go looking for higher yields, I expect them to flock back to ADX, drawn by its new dividend policy, its strong performance history and its high yield, too For bonds, let’s go with the Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (BGH). BGH focuses on high-yield corporate bonds and yields 8.4%, while focusing on short-term bonds as a way to lower the risks of those bonds falling in value during a market panic, since they come to term so quickly. The fund’s payout is monthly and steady, having gone unchanged for years, with the odd special dividend (the spikes below), too: BGH Dividend That’s a much bigger dividend than JNK offers. And even though JNK does pay monthly, BGH’s payout is a picture of calm in comparison to JNK’s “squirrely” dividend: JNK Dividend By lending to large, established companies, BGH generates reliable cash flow. Limiting its investments to short-term bonds also lowers the risk of these investments going sour. And as you can see below, BGH’s discount is still wide, at around 6%, but it’s trending higher—a very nice setup. BGH Discount NAV I see this one trading at a premium as more income-seekers make their way to bonds as Treasuries yield less and CDs mature. Finally, a word on junk bonds and the risk of defaults, which is overblown. As we discussed in the September CEF Insider, American companies are far from struggling to meet their obligations, with fewer than 1% of issuers defaulting: Defaults Decline So don’t let the words “junk” or “high-yield” put you off—and cause you to miss out on BGH and its steady (and monthly paid) 8.4%-yielding dividend. The Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO) gives us exposure to top US large caps like Microsoft and Apple, much like ADX. But US stocks make up just 48% of the portfolio. The next-biggest slice (36%) goes to international equities like Nestle SA, pharmaceutical firm Sanofi and Compass Group PLC, a British food-service firm. The remainder (around 16%) is in fixed-income assets, mostly investment-grade bonds, to add a bit of extra stability. The whole package delivers a 7.8% dividend, paid monthly. And management recently raised it: ETO Dividend Trading at an 8.7% discount to NAV as I write this, BGH offers a smart blend of growth and income at a bargain price and, as with BGH, that discount is slowly disappearing.

US stocks opened higher on Tuesday as investors welcomed a pullback in surging oil prices, putting focus back on the ongoing debate over the economy and interest rates. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) stepped up around 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also rose about 0.5% as tech megacaps began to recoup some of the previous session's losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Stocks are set to pick up on the winning trend of recent months as Monday's headwinds ease, with oil prices retreating as Mideast tensions cool somewhat. Some "Magnificent 7" stocks were starting to regain ground lost amid negative headlines, with Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) all nudging slightly higher. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) built on a closing gain as the chip heavyweight's partner Hon Hai pointed to "crazy" AI demand. But the market is still grappling with busted hopes for jumbo interest-rate cuts, while lingering recession worries got a boost as China failed to deliver expected big stimulus on Tuesday. Stocks in Hong Kong (^HSI) slumped over 9%, as a roaring stimulus-fueled rally in Chinese stocks fizzled out. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards On that theme, Federal Reserve policy is "well positioned" to nail a "soft landing" for the economy, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times. Meanwhile, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said data will continue to drive rate decisions. Those comments sharpened investors' focus on the CPI inflation report due Thursday, which will provide further clues on the path forward for interest rates. In corporates, PepsiCo (PEP) got the ball rolling on earnings season, posting a surprise drop in quarterly revenue and lowering its forecast for 2024 sales growth. Shares of the snack and drinks giant slipped in early trading. US stocks opened higher on Tuesday after all three major indexes closed Monday's session in the red. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each climbed around 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%. Oil prices, which have surged amid Middle East tensions, retreated early Tuesday. Crude oil (CL=F) fell about 3% to trade just below $75 a barrel. PepsiCo (PEP) lowered its sales outlook for the year, forecasting organic revenue growth in the low single digits below the previously expected 4% growth. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, PepsiCo's third-quarter revenue trailed behind Wall Street's estimates, coming in at $23.3 billion, versus the $23.8 billion expected. CEO Ramon Laguarta said in the release that Pepsi's performance was impacted by "subdued category performance trends in North America," the impact of recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and business disruptions from "rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets." In a phone interview with Yahoo Finance, Laguarta said consumers are "very challenged" and they are making a "lot of trade-offs" when it comes to food. Those tradeoffs are weighing on the snacks business most acutely, Laguarta explained. PepsiCo shares dipped nearly 1% in pre-market trading. Read the full story here. Sign in to access your portfolio

PepsiCo (PEP) earnings come in below estimates and it cuts its full-year guidance; Honeywell (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division; a judge rules that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google must offer alternatives to its Play Store; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising after it overtakes Microsoft (MSFT) as the second-largest company by market capitalization; and Amazon (AMZN) Prime Big Deal Days kicks off as retailers look to grab consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season. Here's what investors need to know today. PepsiCo (PEP) shares are slipping about 1% in premarket trading after the soda giant reported third-quarter revenue of $23.32 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.13 that came in below expectations. "Given our performance to date and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue (previously approximately 4 percent organic revenue growth)," PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ramon Laguarta said. PepsiCo's report comes after it warned about a weaker consumer in its prior-quarter report. Honeywell International (HON) will spin off its Advanced Materials division into a separate publicly traded company, the conglomerate said. According to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the plan, the division could be worth more than $10 billion as a separately traded public company. Shares of Honeywell were roughly 2% higher in premarket trading. A U.S. judge has issued a permanent injunction that will force Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play Store on Android phones. The ruling comes from video game maker Epic Games' successful antitrust suit, which found that Google maintained illegal monopoly power in operating its app store. After declining about 2.5% Monday, Alphabet shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) are gaining about 2% in premarket trading, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) in market capitalization to become the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares added 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, as its partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported strong shipments of its GPU processors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Amazon (AMZN) will hold its Prime Big Deal Days today and tomorrow as retailers attempt to draw in consumers looking to get an early start on holiday shopping. Concurrently, Walmart (WMT) is running its Holiday Deals event from today through Sunday, while Target (TGT) is holding its second Circle Week of the year through Saturday. Shares of Amazon are higher by less than 1% in premarket trading, while Walmart and Target are little changed.

As worldwide markets are challenged in an environment of higher interest rates, conflict in the Middle East, and the lingering battle between Russia and Ukraine, one thing has not changed: U.S. stocks are more expensive than global stocks. And with the large run-up in stock prices in late 2023 and the first half of 2024, U.S. stocks are even more expensive. Consider P/E ratios. The trailing P/E ratio on the S&P 500 is 28, above the global average of 14 and well above the 6-12 average P/Es for emerging markets stocks. A review of yields tells a similar story. The current dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 1.2%, versus the global average of 2.8% and Asian, Australian and Latin American yields of 3%-6%. The foreign region that does not completely fit the pattern is the Middle East. The average P/E on a Saudi Arabian stock is a relatively high 17. This can be attributed to high oil prices. Taking a step back, one reason investors generally are willing to pay a higher price for North American securities is the transparency of the U.S. financial system as well as the liquidity of U.S. markets. What's more, global returns can be volatile across individual countries, given GOOGL, HUM, NVDA, AVGO, ESYJY, EJTTF, HBI, ZTNO, INTC, ADBE, AMD, RGEN, AMZN, MRVL SMCI LEN, SMCI, CENT BABA, FBIN, LAZ, PTON, SMCI, K, SNAP, AAP, VFC, CAVA, IART, GEV, RKT, MRNA, PLTR LLY

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak. Here’s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them: Meta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how. Both stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index. Valuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant’s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector. The Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, “The profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.” Although there was a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October. Meta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta’s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September. The two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses. The stock has been on a steady climb since then. Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. Further Upside? The average analysts’ price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir. Current Price 1-Year Average Analysts’ Price Target Upside/Downside Potential Meta $595.94 $608.20 +2.06% Palantir $40.01 $27.67 (-30.84%) The next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company’s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta’s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta. Palantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact. More importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.

Title: Spotify’s HR chief says remote staff aren’t ‘children’ as company reaffirms work-from-anywhere policy
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/08/spotifys-hr-chief-remote-staff-flexible-work-policy/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:21Z

Amid a raft of return-to-office mandates from tech giants, including Amazon and iPhone challenger Nothing, Spotify sees no need to treat its staff like “children” and end its popular work-from-home policy. Spotify went through an overhaul last year, laying off 17% of its staff in December in a move CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged had a larger impact on operations than the company had anticipated. The decision has helped almost double Spotify’s market value this year, as the group notched record quarterly revenues while cutting costs. However, inside Spotify, the layoffs have shaken morale. For those who survived the cull, there isn’t likely to be a further morale-sapping plan to break with Spotify’s popular “work from anywhere” policy. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grownups and then treat them like children,” Spotify’s chief human resources officer Katarina Berg told Raconteur, explaining the group’s continued flexible work location policy. “We are a business that’s been digital from birth, so why shouldn’t we give our people flexibility and freedom? “Work is not a place you come to, it’s something you do.” In February 2021, Spotify joined several other tech groups in allowing its employees to “work from anywhere.” This enabled employees to choose where and how they worked, provided the company had an office in that jurisdiction. Unlike other companies that have trickled employees back in on a hybrid basis, like Meta, or gone all-out and demanded a full return to the office, like Amazon, Spotify hasn’t chosen to renege on this policy. A big reason is likely the effect it has had on retention. Spotify said attrition rates were 15% lower in the second quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of 2019. The company also said it had improved the diversity of its talent. While Spotify doesn’t intend to scrap its remote-working policy anytime soon, Berg acknowledged it wasn’t an ideal setup. “It is harder and we all struggle to collaborate in a virtual environment,” Berg said. “But does that mean that we will start forcing people to come into the office as soon as there is a trend for it? No.” The company is still using innovative ways to encourage its music-loving staff to come into the office, including hosting “listening lounge” sessions featuring pop stars including Olivia Dean and Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. Staff are also strongly encouraged to come into the office during Spotify’s “core week” to reconnect and discuss strategy. Spotify’s biggest-ever round of layoffs last December, when it said goodbye to 1,500 staff, came as CEO Ek said the company was doing too much “work around the work.” The impact of those layoffs on operations was bigger than Ek expected, with Berg explaining to Raconteur that remaining staffers were left in a “state of shock” by the cull. “Spotify had been in hypergrowth, and this was the only thing people knew,” she said. “A lot of people at Spotify had never seen a recession, and it was a lot to absorb and digest.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: How Kamala Harris Is Creating a New Majoritarian Center
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/186863/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-majoritarian-center
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Almost from the moment Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, the concern trolling commenced. “Harris’s biggest political liability is that she may be seen as too politically extreme,” fretted very serious journalist Josh Barro before advising the new Democratic nominee to “run to the center.” Former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Schoen concurred, confidently telling CNBC that “the key for her campaign is moving to the center.” To satisfy New York magazine political columnist Jonathan Chait, a mere “pivot” to the center would not be enough. Rather, he provocatively suggested, “Harris needs to adopt positions that will upset progressive activists.” Apparently, Harris’s nomination didn’t just unite the Democratic base. It also united a parade of pundits, politicos, and conventional wisdom–mongers of all stripes in urging her to unceremoniously betray the base by swerving to the center—especially on the economy—if she’s to have a fighting chance of defeating Donald Trump at the polls. Given the divisive state of American politics, that might not sound like such an unreasonable take. But glaringly absent from this allegedly centrist consensus is a working definition of what or where the political and economic “center” actually is. And spoiler alert: On most issues, the center is arguably somewhere in the vicinity of Kamala Harris. Especially on the economy. To understand why, we need to think a little bit about what would comprise a truly “centrist economics.” But before we do that, we need to define our terms. The whole left-right dichotomy dates back to the early days of the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly who favored a more revolutionary path (that is, a republic) took to sitting to the left, while those defending the ancien régime (the monarchists) gathered together on the right. Today, we universally put conservatives on the right and progressives on the left. Policies that favor the rich go on the right, policies that favor working people go on the left. An economic ideology that advocates unfettered free market capitalism definitely goes on the right, while a Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is the sine qua non of far left. Most people still have a shared intuition about what the political labels “left” and “right” mean, particularly in regard to how competing policy proposals relate to one another. But the “center”? Not so much. For example, most people would instantly agree that a proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would fall on the left or even far-left side of the spectrum. After all, it’s more than double! Yet ask people to pick an ideologically “centrist” minimum wage rate and this remarkable consensus instantly falls apart. Self-described centrists often pride themselves on reaching across the aisle to negotiate bipartisan compromise. But ideological centrism can’t be as simple as just splitting the difference—in fact, on many noneconomic issues, difference-splitting would be facially absurd. For example, how do we split the difference on marriage equality, or on the peaceful transfer of power? How would we split the difference on Trump’s plan for the “bloody” deportation of 20 million people? Would a centrist alternative be just 10 million deportations, and with precisely half as much blood? And even on economic issues that can be easily quantified in dollars, difference-splitting can make little sense. Splitting the difference between $15 and $0—that’s the essence of the Project 2025 proposal, which would allow states to opt out of enforcing a minimum wage at all—would set the federal minimum wage at just 25 cents more than the current $7.25-an-hour rate that has been relentlessly eroded away by inflation for the 15 years that have passed since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. That’s not centrism. That’s defending the status quo, a quintessentially conservative instinct that has long been associated with the political right. The truth is, there is no inherently centrist ideology. According to an analysis by 538, the large plurality of voters who self-identify as moderate are in fact “all over the ideological map.” That’s why if you ask the average person to describe an ideologically centrist policy position, they usually default to the position they already hold. And in fact, that’s exactly what Barro and Schoen and Chait and others have done in assuming that Harris’s positions are “too politically extreme.” The center to them is where they currently stand—smack dab in the middle of the old neoliberal consensus that had long dominated both parties before Biden abandoned it in favor of an agenda that grows the economy “from the middle out.” And it’s that neoliberal center they want Harris to reclaim. Neoliberalism argues that markets are inherently efficient, rational, and meritocratic, and that the fastest path toward achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people is to simply get out of the market’s way. Over the nearly half-century during which neoliberalism held sway, the ideologically centrist agenda was dominated by tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of the powerful, and wage suppression for everyone else. The result was decades of rising and radical inequality that have undermined faith in both democracy and markets. And if this sort of centrism is your measuring stick, then yes, the Harris agenda might look a little extreme. But there are in fact two kinds of political centers: There’s the ideological center—the one that neoliberals have long occupied. And there’s the majoritarian center—the one where most of the people are. Harris’s critics are half correct. If Democrats hope to be a majority party, they need to embrace the center. But it’s the majoritarian center, not the ideological one, that matters most in November. As I argued in Politico Magazine back in 2018, to understand the difference between these two strains of economic centrism, it’s important to understand exactly what the center is measuring. Imagine lining up every person in America on a yardstick, with the poorest person standing to the far-left edge of the stick (zero inches) and the wealthiest person standing to the far right (36 inches). Assuming that people are equally spaced, and that there is no correlation between wealth and weight—if you could balance that yardstick on the tip of your finger—the fulcrum would fall on the 18-inch mark, the exact center of the yardstick, with exactly half of all Americans standing to the left, and the other half standing to the right. Clustered on and near that 18-inch mark are the median American families—the middle-middle class: the majoritarian center of the American electorate, at least from an economic perspective. Now imagine that very same yardstick with every American standing in their very same spots—only this time, rather than balancing people, we are balancing their personal wealth, stacked up in $100 bills. But because 2 percent of Americans (of which I am one) own 50 percent of the nation’s wealth, to balance this yardstick you’d now have to slide your finger nearly all the way over, beyond the 35-inch mark, just inside the far-right edge. This fulcrum balances the interests of capital versus the interests of working people. And unfortunately, this is the yardstick that represents the reality of political and economic power distribution in the United States. It’s the yardstick of the neoliberal center—a centrism informed by the bad economic theories that guided the policies of both parties for more than 40 years. This precarious balancing act helps explain why policies that would clearly benefit the majoritarian center are so often rejected as ideologically “far left”; for an ideological centrism that seeks to balance the interests of capital is a centrism that seeks to protect the interests of the very wealthiest Americans against those of everybody else. By contrast, a majoritarian centrism focuses its policies more on outcomes than on ideology. For example, consider again the $15 minimum wage, a policy our intuition suggests leans ideologically to the left. At $7.25 an hour, the current federal minimum wage provides a floor under only 1.1 percent of all wage and salary workers—a cohort one might fairly characterize as occupying the far left of our economic yardstick. By comparison, a hike to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly benefit 29.2 percent of workers. And with half of all American jobs paying less than $23.11 an hour, a $20 minimum wage (almost exactly what the minimum wage would be today had it been raised to $15 and indexed to inflation back when that idea was first proposed in 2012) would directly cover a large plurality of workers, while indirectly pushing wages higher for many millions more as employers raise wages further up the pay scale in order to maintain differentiation relative to the minimum. From a majoritarian perspective—a perspective that asks, “Who benefits?”—the higher you raise the minimum wage, the more centrist the policy becomes! (For those neoliberals still insisting the minimum wage would hurt workers by destroying jobs, a recent meta-analysis of 88 minimum wage studies concluded that estimates published since 2010 found near zero offset from earnings due to lost jobs.) Further bolstering its centrist credentials, raising the minimum wage turns out to be extraordinarily popular across all partisan identifications. Eighty-five percent of likely voters would support a $9 minimum wage, 83 percent a $12 minimum wage, and 64 percent a $17 minimum wage. Even Republicans are largely on board. It’s hard to find another economic issue with greater majoritarian support. And the minimum wage is just one of many intuitively left- (and sometimes right-) leaning proposals that pass the following two-part majoritarian centrist test: 1. Is the policy broadly beneficial? A policy that directly benefits a majority of Americans clearly passes this part of the test, but so might a policy that benefits a large plurality, especially if the beneficiaries are clustered around the middle. 2. Is the policy broadly popular? Obviously, policies that enjoy majority support are clearly popular, and most of the elements of the Biden-Harris economic agenda pass this test. Even Harris’s pledge to go after price gouging, widely derided by economists, is popular. But in addition, given a deeply divided electorate, a policy should not necessarily require an absolute majority in order to pass this test. For example, a policy that receives just 40 percent support but with only 20 percent opposed may in fact be more majoritarian and certainly less divisive than a policy that enjoys a slim 50.1 percent majority support to 49.9 percent opposed. A policy that is both broadly beneficial and broadly popular is properly located within the majoritarian center. And by this measure, the bulk of Harris’s economic agenda is inarguably centrist regardless of how ideologically left or right we might at first intuit it to be. In fact, if you step through Harris’s 82-page economic plan and evaluate it from the left, right, and center (I’m looking at you, Josh Barro), I challenge you to conclude that any of her proposals are “politically extreme” either by ideological or majoritarian standards. Among Harris’s signature proposals is to cut taxes on more than 100 million working- and middle-class families through restoring and enhancing the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, with the costs paid for by increasing the tax on stock buybacks, enacting a billionaire’s tax, and raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning more than a million dollars a year. All of these proposals score as both broadly popular and (unless you’re a recalcitrant trickle-downer) broadly beneficial, so they are majoritarian centrist to their core. But instructively, they also highlight how useless our ideological intuitions can sometimes be. The EITC, for example, has long been an essential thread in our social safety net, lifting millions of families out of poverty by supplementing low-wage pay. So it sure feels like it leans to the left. And yet … first proposed by Richard Nixon and signed into law by Gerald Ford, the EITC is essentially a variation on Milton Friedman’s negative income tax—about as economically right a pedigree as a policy could have. Furthermore, in practice, this tax credit is as much a subsidy to low-wage employers as it is to low-wage workers, helping to perpetuate an exploitive business model that increases profits at the expense of the working poor. And this isn’t the only Harris proposal that challenges standard categories. On housing, Harris proposes working with public, private, and not-for-profit developers to build an additional three million affordable housing units over the course of her first term, while “cut[ting] red tape” (i.e., deregulation) and imposing new regulations on corporate property owners who drive up prices by hoarding supply or by colluding on rents. In addition, she proposes to help first-time homebuyers with up to $25,000 toward a down payment. Because this ideologically nuanced fusion of regulation, deregulation, public investment, and market incentives would benefit millions, it clearly serves the interests of the majoritarian center. And while neoliberal critics might dismiss any role for government in directing the housing industry as too far left, there remains “strong bipartisan support for federal action” on housing affordability. The same is true of Harris’s pledge to “build” on the progress made through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan, as well as to continue the Biden administration’s practices in favor of organized labor and against unfair trade. This embrace of industrial policy—of (gasp) state planning—might reasonably be intuited as ideologically left. Yet many of the policies required to implement it (for example, hundreds of billions of dollars of grants and loans to giant corporations) arguably lean to the right. So which is it? Republican Senator Marco Rubio makes a compelling case that industrial policy, properly done, is inherently neither left nor right, and I totally agree. That said, the policy objectives are all broadly progressive, broadly popular, and if properly done, broadly beneficial. The rest of Harris’s agenda is easier on our ideological intuition. Her proposal to increase the startup expense tax deduction for new businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 arguably leans right, while nearly everything else is at least moderately progressive. But they are all majoritarian. Protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing quality affordable childcare, long term care, and education, tackling the climate crisis and lowering energy costs by investing in clean energy, lowering drug prices by taking on Big Pharma, and “expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act” (as opposed to Trump’s “concepts of a plan” to repeal and replace it)—they all pass the test. Quibble with the details of my analysis all you want, but there is arguably nothing in Harris’s economic plan that is ideologically “extreme,” and while taken as a whole her agenda is clearly progressive, it is also more fiscally conservative than what her opponent has proposed. Don’t take my word for it: The Penn Wharton Budget Model—a paragon of neoliberal orthodoxy—finds that Harris’s tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. By comparison, the Trump proposals? $5.8 trillion! From a budget hawk perspective, it’s the Trump economic agenda that is extreme. Of course, the obvious question, the one that is always hurled at Democrats who propose good things, is “How are you going to pay for it?” And the answer is that policies that grow the middle class pay for themselves. Not in the first year, maybe not over 10 years, but certainly in the long run, because, as Harris recently explained in a speech to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the middle class is “the growth engine of our economy.” This is the “middle-out economics” that clearly infuses Harris’s economic agenda—an economics informed by decades of empirical research and the latest advances in the fields of complex systems theory, evolutionary theory, physics, behavioral psychology, and other disciplines. And while middle-out still has far to go before achieving the same ideological devotion as neoliberalism, it has already proven far more capable at connecting cause with effect. For example, the Democratic policy agenda has always been more middle-out than the Republicans’, even during the neoliberal era, which helps explain why, by every standard economic metric—including gross domestic product growth, job growth, wage growth, investment growth, the S&P 500, and yes, even inflation—on average, the economy has performed better under Democratic administrations than under Republicans. It’s doubtful that most Democratic elected officials understood that their more inclusive agenda was also more pro-growth, but if they did, they lacked the confidence to run on such an unorthodox claim. The emerging new middle-out consensus finally offers an empirical and theoretical foundation to back it up. What we are seeing in the policies of Biden and Harris and in their rejection of neoliberal orthodoxy is the coalescing of a truly centrist economics that, in Harris’s words, is not “constrained by ideology.” If many of these policies appear to lean to the ideological left, it is merely out of “pragmatic” consideration for how modern market economies work best, and for the indispensable role of government in assuring that they work for everybody. “What makes an economic policy distinctively centrist,” wrote the political scientist Damon Linker in 2019, “is its capacity to speak to the concerns of the broadest possible slice of the electorate—while remaining at all times keenly aware of the main points of fracture in contemporary public opinion.” The key, wrote Linker, “is to follow public opinion wherever it leads,” even when it diverges from that of the neoliberal elites of both parties. “If this centrist agenda sounds like something many progressives would applaud or at least view as a good start, that’s because the new center takes its economic cues from the left side of the traditional spectrum.” When members of the old guard pitch Biden’s exit as an “opportunity” for Democrats to reclaim the center, what they’re really pitching is an opportunity for the neoliberal ancien régime to reclaim the Democratic Party for themselves. But Harris can’t move to the center, because she’s already there. It’s just a different center than the one we’ve been taught to think about. It’s her neoliberal critics who are extreme.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Netflix Earnings

Netflix (NFLX) reports third-quarter earnings next Thursday, Oct. 17, and analysts expect the streaming giant to post year-over-year revenue, profit, and subscriber growth ahead of the final quarter of 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha project that Netflix will report net income of $2.23 billion on revenue of $9.77 billion, up 33% and 14%, respectively, from a year earlier. Shares have gained nearly 45% since the start of the year, but they dipped following the company's quarterly reports in April and July. Analysts expect Netflix to report just under 286 million active subscribers at the end of the quarter, up about 4 million from last quarter and over 30 million more than last year, according to Visible Alpha. Netflix has said it will stop reporting subscriber data starting in 2025, and focus instead on financial metrics. Analysts have said Netflix's crackdown on password sharing has been successful in driving new subscribers. Barclays analysts, however, recently cited the "trade-offs" suggested by its pathways to future growth in downgrading the stock to "underweight" from "equal weight"—making them the only analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with a "sell"-equivalent rating—while leaving unchanged a price target of $550. Netflix has an important fourth quarter, with KeyBanc analysts recently noting that the streamer's first NFL games, which will be broadcast on Christmas Day, could be a catalyst for subscriber growth. The analysts, who raised their price target to $760 from $735, said nearly a quarter of people they surveyed who aren't Netflix subscribers said the games would make them consider signing up. The Christmas games are the latest bet on live sports from Netflix and other streamers as a way to draw new subscribers. Netflix is also set to become the official broadcaster of TKO Group's (TKO) WWE professional wrestling events starting next year.

Title: Nvidia: What are investors are asking?

Investing.com -- Analysts at Citi have been on the road marketing in Boston and Europe, where they discussed with investors key topics regarding the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. According to the Wall Street firm, the company's AI adoption “remains in 3rd/4th innings as enterprise AI demand takes off next with AI agents.” Analysts expect Nvidia stock to remain range-bound through the CES event in early 2025 before new product launches, such as Blackwell GPUs, drive a sales and margin inflection. Citi notes that a recurring investor concern is Nvidia's gross margin trajectory. The bank predicts that gross margins will bottom out at around 72% in the January quarter, stabilizing in the mid-70s once the Blackwell series ramps up. Another focal point for investors is the competition between Nvidia’s GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). While ASICs can be advantageous for fixed-function applications, Nvidia GPUs offer versatility. As AI models expand, Nvidia's GPUs, which are capable of handling various applications, will likely see continued demand, analysts said. Moreover, enterprises favor multi-cloud strategies, and GPUs allow applications to run across different cloud platforms without rewriting. Citi also highlights that data center operators prioritize the total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI), areas where Nvidia continues to lead due to its ability to run diverse applications, including AI. “As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases,” analysts said in a Monday note. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on Nvidia’s vertical integration strategy, which has progressed from chips to entire systems, a response to the slowdown of Moore’s Law. As for the Blackwell sales mix, the shift towards the GB200 format from the B100’s 8-GPU format is also expected to optimize TCO and ROI, Citi’s note states. Looking ahead, investors are optimistic about the long-term ROI, particularly with Nvidia’s emphasis on AI across large markets like social media and e-commerce. However, patience will be required as generative AI matures into disruptive business models. “We expect to see positive ROI data points next year led by GPU-as-a-service providers,” analysts said. With a Buy rating and a price target of $150, Citi remains bullish on Nvidia, with potential risks stemming from competition in gaming and possible market volatility in the auto and data center segments.

Nvidia's (NVDA) market capitalization overtook Microsoft's (MSFT) on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL). Nvidia shares climbed just over 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, ahead of Microsoft's $3.04 trillion. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a partner of Nvidia, reported strong shipments of its GPUs driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, helping send shares of both companies higher. Nvidia and Microsoft have been jockeying with Apple for the top spot by market cap in recent months. In June, Nvidia briefly took the crown when it surpassed Microsoft, but Microsoft later reclaimed the title, and Apple has since pulled ahead. Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, as demand for its AI chips surged. Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending trends and seasonal tailwinds. Semiconductor companies typically perform better in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter, with Nvidia “still set to lead," Melius Research analysts said Monday, adding "the setup here is still pretty darn good." Melius holds a price target of $165 for Nvidia, a 29% premium on Monday's closing price of $127.72. That compares to an average price target of $152.52, according to Visible Alpha.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will hold its "Advancing AI" event this week, with analysts expecting new product announcements that could drive the stock higher and lift sales. AMD shares are more than 15% above where they started the year, though off the record levels set in March. Thirteen analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating on AMD stock, while three have a "hold" rating. AMD stock has an average target price of $190.56, meaning analysts broadly expect AMD shares will rise a further 11%. AMD closed Monday at just under $171 after changing only slightly tostart the week. The company's shares rose nearly 20% in the days following a similar event last December. Analysts have said they expect AMD to announce new products at the Thursday event, which could pave the way for it to gain market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator space as it faces off against Nvidia (NVDA), the industry leader. Analysts said the "AI ecosystems partners, customers and developers" that AMD mentioned in the event's announcement could include new customers—evidence of AMD's growing market share.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Citi has penned an important investment note on NVIDIA today, touching on the stock's immediate prospects and the likely trajectory of the GPU manufacturer's margins as the Blackwell production ramp-up gets underway. Off the bat, Citi has asserted that NVIDIA's under-pressure gross margins will bottom out in the low-70s percents in Q1 2025, with the Wall Street titan continuing to view the ~72 percent level as the likely trough. After Q1, Citi expects NVIDIA's gross margins to stabilize in "the mid-70s%" as the Blackwell architecture ramps up. The bank notes: "While we are bullish on another strong +40% Y/Y cloud data center capex growth next year, we expect the stock to likely remain range bound through CES Jan before Blackwell driven Y/Y sales and gross margin inflection in the Apr-Q." On the topic of the GPU competition that is rapidly heating up, Citi perceives no immediate threat as NVIDIA's products currently lead the market on multiple metrics, including the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and the Return on Investment (ROI). The bank believes data centers prefer NVIDIA's GPUs for the flexibility that they offer: "As NVDA runs various applications including AI, the data center operators rely on NVDA to have the hardware to run multiple applications rather than buying accelerators that are limited in their use cases." According to the bank, an enterprise operating across multiple cloud-based platforms has to re-write its applications specific to every cloud operator, which poses a huge pain point. In contrast, "with NVDA GPUs, enterprises write their applications once as it will be transferable across clouds." What's more, NVIDIA's large installed base already constitutes a strong pull for developers, who desire "the largest possible adoption of their applications." On the topic of the Blackwell sales mix, Citi asserts that the GB200 chip will attract a greater proportion of orders from customers instead of the "B100’s 8-GPU format," owing to the former's favorable TCO and ROI metrics. In light of its positive - if a bit dampened - view on NVIDIA, Citi has maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a target of $150 per share.

Title: Humana Stock Is at Multiyear Lows as Investors Digest Its Medicare Rating

Time Published: 2024-10-07T19:22:52Z
Full Content:
Humana (HUM) shares slid after Jefferies downgraded the insurer's stock, pointing to the negative impacts of the company's latest ratings for its Medicare offerings. Humana stock plunged last week after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said the quality rating of one of its plans, which accounts for nearly half of its Medicare Advantage (MA) memberships, fell to 3.5 stars down from 4.5 stars last year. Higher star ratings generate bonus payments for the insurers that offer plans that earn them. Today the shares, down nearly 2%, are trading at lows not seen since the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Jefferies, meanwhile, cut its rating on Humana to “hold” from “buy,” and slashed its price target from $419 to $253, well off Wall Street's consensus around $327 according to Visible Alpha data. The analysts said that although Humana is suing the CMS, calling its star ratings process flawed—and noting that United Health Group (UNH) and Elevance Health (ELV) both filed successful appeals last year—they are continuing to move forward as if Humana would not win its appeal against CMS. Shares of Humana have sunk since the CMS rating came out last week, adding to a slump that began in January when the company first warned that higher medical costs and government regulations would hurt profits.

Title: Nvidia Eclipses Microsoft As World’s Second-Largest Company As Stock Climbs To 6-Week High

Nvidia stock rallied Monday despite a broader down day on Wall Street for its big technology peers, boosting the artificial intelligence heavyweight to reclaim its spot as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang speaks last month at a Washington, D.C., conference. Nvidia notched its highest intraday share price since Aug. 26 at $130.64, with shares up about 4.2% by mid-afternoon. The Silicon Valley firm accordingly registered its highest market capitalization since August, and its $3.19 trillion market value sent it past Microsoft ($3.07 trillion) as the world’s second-largest company for the first time in six weeks; Nvidia now only trails Apple’s $3.4 trillion valuation. Nvidia stock’s strong start to the week came despite broader losses, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% as higher bond yields and oil prices ate into the equity boost from shifting U.S. monetary policy. Shares of all five trillion-dollar tech companies other than Nvidia fell Monday, with Apple down 1.3%, Microsoft 0.7%, Google parent Alphabet 1.4%, Amazon 2.8% and Facebook parent Meta 0.9%. Nvidia, which designs a full suite of custom AI technology intended for high-end applications like large-language models, benefitted Monday from fellow AI tech maker Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products deployed alongside Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) was strong this quarter. Another bullish analyst note also boosted shares, as Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote to clients the “setup here is still pretty darn good” for Nvidia stock even as it enjoys an extended bounce. “Strong AI spending” from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and ChatGPT parent OpenAI should “catalyze consumption” of Nvidia’s core (GPUs), according to Reitzes. The demand optimism follows continued comments from Nvidia’s centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang insisting demand for its AI products is “so great” and “insane.” Monday is a continuation of a month-long period of outsized returns for Nvidia, as its 26% return since Sept. 6 trounces the S&P’s 6% gain during the period and its five trillion-dollar peers’ 7% average gain. Nvidia was briefly the world’s largest company in June, when its share price peaked at a still-record $140.76. Previously a fairly low-profile company known for its video game business, Nvidia became a Wall Street darling as its profits skyrocketed amid the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s valuation has increased tenfold over the past two years. $21.9 billion. That’s how much in adjusted profits Nvidia is expected to report in its fiscal quarter ending this month, according to average analyst forecasts tracked by FactSet. That’s a more than 80% year-over-year increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and a more than 1,000% jump from 2022’s comparable period. One Community.

Those hoping the mass layoffs among Big Tech companies were finally ending are in for a disappointment, with a new report predicting Amazon is on the verge of cutting nearly 14,000 manager roles. According to Morgan Stanley, via TechCrunch’s Manish Singh, Morgan Stanley says Amazon will reduce its manager headcount by 13,834 by the end of the Q1 2025.

More recently, the company has rolled out a controversial five-day-a-week RTO mandate, which some believe to be an effort to thin the company’s ranks and trim unneeded roles. Some employees have already voiced their opposition to the RTO mandate, with some saying they have no intention of complying, often because they were hired during the pandemic, assured remote work would continue, and live outside commuting range of any corporate office. It’s unclear at this time if Amazon will primarily target these individuals, or if the layoffs will have a wider scope.

Title: EM Currencies Fall for Fifth Day as Traders Temper Fed Bets

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies declined for a fifth consecutive session on Monday as traders scaled back bets on another big interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve amid signs of a resilient US economy. The MSCI Inc. gauge for developing-nation currencies was down 0.3% as of 12:10 p.m. in New York, posting its longest streak of losses since July. The Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah were among the worst performers in a basket of currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Oil prices rose as investors remain nervous about increased tensions in the Middle East. Traders have been rethinking the path for the Fed’s policy easing since the release of stronger-than-expected US jobs data on Friday. US Treasury 10-year yields rose to hover the 4% level as traders pared wagers on another half-point cut by the US central bank. “The repricing of the US easing cycle is likely to keep EMFX under pressure in the short term,” said Luis Estrada, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Bearish bets on the US dollar are being dismantled, while some investors are also buying dollars to hedge their constructive wagers on EM rates, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists cut their recommendation on EM local-currency debt last week, citing the “big upside surprise” in payrolls and risks stemming from the US presidential election in about a month. That comes after EM local bonds posted their biggest quarterly advance since 2020. The benchmark for emerging-market equities rose for a second day, mostly driven by gains in shares of Asian semiconductor companies. A subindex for Latin America stocks retreated. Optimism about stimulus measures has sparked a massive rally in Chinese stocks. Exchange-traded funds that buy the nation’s equities have seen billions of dollars in inflows. China’s top economic planner will hold a press briefing on Tuesday to discuss a package of policies aimed at boosting economic growth. Details on potential fiscal policy stimulus will be key in determining whether the momentum of the current rally can continue or whether the relief might be only temporary, according to Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. “In the short term, EM ex-China stocks may continue to underperform China due to rotational shifts in capital flows,” Dinic said. In credit markets, El Salvador’s notes jumped after the government launched a tender offer for several debt instruments. Bonds maturing in 2050 rose as much as 2.8 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing collected by Bloomberg. Ghana bonds also rose after the nation received “overwhelming” backing of bondholders to restructure $13 billion of eurobonds. --With assistance from Srinivasan Sivabalan.

Title: Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn’t thinking too far ahead
URL: https://www.theverge.com/24260181/rabbit-r1-large-action-model-lam-playground-generative-ai-jesse-lyu-interview-users
Time Published: 2024-10-07T15:33:37Z

By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Today, I’m talking with Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO of Rabbit. The startup company makes the adorable r1 AI gadget — a little handheld designed by superstar design firm Teenage Engineering. It’s meant to be how you talk to an AI agent, which then goes off onto the internet and does things for you, from playing music on Spotify and ordering an Uber to even buying things on Amazon. Rabbit launched with a lot of hype at CES and a big party in New York, but early reviews of the device were universally bad. Our own David Pierce gave it a 3 out of 10 in May, saying that most of the features don’t work or don’t even exist. And the core feature that didn’t seem to exist was the most important of all: Rabbit’s large action model, or LAM, which is meant to allow the system to open a web browser in the cloud and browse for you. The LAM is supposed to intelligently understand what it’s looking at on a website and literally click around to accomplish tasks on your behalf. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! There have been a lot of questions about just how real Rabbit’s LAM was, but the company finally launched what it calls the LAM Playground, which lets people use a bare-bones version of the system. It does indeed appear to be clicking around on the web, although it is very slow. So, I wanted to know how Jesse planned to invest in the LAM and compete with other AI agents that promise to do things for you. For example, Microsoft just announced a new agent-y version of Copilot, and Apple’s vision for the next generation of Siri is an AI agent — and it’ll run on your phone and have direct access to those apps and your data inside them. It’s the same with Google and Gemini and Amazon’s rumored next generation of Alexa. This is major competition for a startup, and Jesse talked about wanting to get out ahead of it. But really, I wanted to know how Rabbit’s system works and whether it’s durable — not just technically, which is challenging, but also from a business and legal perspective. After all, if Rabbit’s idea works and the LAM really does go and browse websites for you… what’s stopping companies like Spotify and DoorDash from blocking it? You might have a strong point of view here — Jesse certainly does — but at some point, there’s going to be a fight about this, and it’s not clear what’s going to happen. To put this in historical context, about a decade ago, a handful of startups tried to stream broadcast television without licenses by putting a bunch of antennas in a single location and building apps that let people access them. This felt technically legal — what’s the difference between all those people having their own antennas and putting all those antennas in a single place and those accessing them over the internet? Some of these companies were seriously innovative — the most famous was a company called Aereo, which spent a ton of money designing specialized TV antennas the size of a nickel so it could pack as many of them into a data center as possible. I wrote about Aereo back then — visited the antenna floor, interviewed the CEO, the whole thing. Aereo then got sued by the TV networks, the case went to the Supreme Court in 2014, and you will note that Aereo no longer exists. I don’t know if Rabbit is another Aereo, and I don’t know how all these companies will react to having robots browse their websites instead of people. And I certainly don’t know how legal systems around the world will handle the inevitable lawsuits to come. I asked Jesse about all of this, and you’ll hear his answer: he thinks Rabbit will be so successful that these companies will want to show up and make deals. I have to say, I don’t know about that, either. I do know that this is a pretty intense and occasionally contentious interview. Jesse didn’t back down, and that means we got pretty deep into it. Let me know what you think. Okay, Jesse Lyu, founder and CEO of Rabbit. Here we go. The following transcript was edited for clarity. Jesse Lyu, you’re the founder and CEO of Rabbit. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. Glad to be here. I’m very excited to talk to you. Rabbit is a fascinating company. The idea for the r1 product is fascinating. I think a lot of people think that something that looks like the r1 is the next evolution of smartphones or products or something. And then there’s the company itself, which is really interesting, and you’ve got a connection to Teenage Engineering, which is one of our favorite companies here at The Verge. So, just a lot to talk about. And you’ve got some news to share about opening up Rabbit’s Large Action Model so people can play with it, and it’s kind of an early version. I really want to talk about that. But let’s start with Rabbit itself. The company has not been around that long. The r1 just started shipping six months ago. What is Rabbit? How’d the company start? Long story short, it’s a very young company. So here’s a little bit of history of it. I actually started a AI company back in 2013, which was called Raven Tech, and we were at YC Winter ‘15 batch. And it’s basically my personal dream to chase this grand vision that, I guess, me being this generation, growing up, we watched so many sci-fi movies, there’s AI stuff here and there. And I guess every geek wants to build their own Jarvis at some point. So I think that’s exactly how I started Raven Tech 11, 12 years ago. And back then, we had this idea, we had this direction, but the technology back then — obviously, there wasn’t like GPU training, there weren’t transformers and stuff. So we worked really hard on the early days of voice dictation and NLP and NLU, which is natural language processing and natural language understanding. So the technology wasn’t there, but we tried our best. We actually built and entire cloud system and the hardware, which is similar to what we have in Rabbit today. But the form factor was more of a smart speaker — as we all know back 10 years ago, everyone was chasing that form factor. Ultimately, the company got acquired, so it’s not a new idea for myself, but it’s definitely a new opportunity that when I saw the progress on the research side, the transformer, obviously, [when] I got a chance to try ChatGPT, or GPT’s API. We were really impressed because we felt the timing is right. Because being able to do something like r1 or more sci-fi, Jarvis stuff, you really need to figure out two parts from the back end. One is that you want to make sure that by talking to the device, the computer or device actually understand what you’re talking about, which is the transformer, the large language model part. But we believe at around 2020, 2021, we believe that the transformer is absolutely the right path that opening, other companies are heading to. We believe that portion has been solved, will be solved. So our focus immediately shifted to: after this device can understand you, can it actually help you do things? And the company that I started 10, 11 years ago, Raven Tech, we were actually one of the first company that designed a cloud API structure. After the [voice] recognition, after the understanding, the query got sent into different APIs. The system has a detector to understand, “Oh, maybe you are looking for a restaurant on Yelp. Maybe you want to play a song from this streaming software.” But I guess 10 years ago, there’s a great opportunity of APIs. There are a lot of company working on APIs. And if you remember 10 years ago in Silicon Valley, everyone was talking about maybe in the future the entire operating system will be just HTML5. Right? But that didn’t live quite long. I think now when we’re looking after 2020, the API business is not really major business for most of the popular services. So we also want to take an evaluation of whether we can build a generic piece of agent technology, which is really hard. Because I believe the current AI is all generic. Obviously, there’s a lot of people doing vertical stuff. Right? You can build an agent for Excel. You can build an agent for legal documentation process. But I think the biggest dream, what’s really make us excited is the generic part of it. It’s like, can we build something that without pre-training, without knowing people want to do what, and they just talk whatever they want, and we’ll be able to smart enough to handle all the tasks. So that’s why we felt the opportunity was right, and we started Rabbit right after COVID. The idea that agents are going to be a big part of our life, and in particular general purpose agents that go take actions for us on the internet — I’ve heard this idea from all kinds of folks, from startup founders like yourself to the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world. I want to come back to that. That’s a big idea, but I just want to stay focused on Rabbit for a second. How many people work at Rabbit today? I believe at the current moment, we’re roughly around 50 people, 50 to 60 people if we plus the interns. But when we started, the company was seven, and by the time we launched as CES it was 17. So just by growing the team within four or five months, it was quite a challenging job for me. So CES was the big launch. We were there, David Pierce was at the party. The Rabbit was introduced. You gave demos in a hotel room, I think. And then you had the launch party here at the TWA Hotel at JFK, which is very cool. The thing’s been out, but you’ve been growing. You said you started at 17 people in January at CES, and you have 50 now. What are you adding all those people to do? Most of it’s just engineers. We have a very small group of design, hardware design or ID that we started from day one, and most of the new folks are working on AI and infrastructure perspective, like cloud basically. We not only ship the hardware. We build the entire Rabbit OS for it. So I think the major work is always going to be in the software part. How is the whole company structured? As you go from seven to 17 to 50, you obviously have to decide how to structure Rabbit. How is that structured now? How has it changed? We are primarily located in Santa Monica. We have a device team of really great folks in the Bay Area, and we have a couple of research engineers here and there. So it’s kind of mostly in person, but a somewhat hybrid system. And the way that we find our people is mostly by internal referring. So we’re not spending money chasing for agents, agencies to do the hiring. Most of the good folks, we basically do internal recommendation. But your 50 people that you have now, how is that organized inside the company? It’s really flat in a sense. We have different departments, obviously. The hardware ODM/OEM part is in Asia. We have our ID team in collaboration with folks in Stockholm.,Teenage Engineering in this case. And we do our own graphics and marketing, all of that in house. And then for the software part, we have the device team that they need to work with the ODM/OEM. And we have the cloud team, we have the AI team. That’s basically how much team we have. And each team, there’s obviously crossovers, and we basically work project-based. So there is no crazy hierarchy going on. I mean, the biggest company I ever led was back in the Raven days. I believe by the time we got acquired, we were 250 people. So this is still within my comfort zone, to manage 50-ish people. Teenage Engineering is a big part of the Rabbit story. They obviously designed the r1 hardware, and then their founder, Jesper Kouthoofd, is your chief design officer. How much more hardware are you designing right now? Are there iterations to come? Do you have a roadmap of new products? The way we work together — obviously this is not the first time we’ve collaborated. We did a collaboration back in Raven days. First of all, Teenage Engineering is my hero company. It’s basically a fanboy dream come true story for me, and I really appreciate their help over the years. The way that we work together is very intuitive. There are obviously many ways that could be considered to be the proper way of designing a project like this, but I think we’re out of the ordinary way of doing this — I can give you an example. Back in the Raven days, all we did is that we had probably two meetings in person, a couple of phone calls, no email, no text messages. We set up a secret Instagram account that we just used to share sketches, and we just hit like on our Instagram accounts, and that’s how we designed the previous Raven project. This time, it was even quicker. I think I shared this publicly. I think we spent probably 10 minutes on deciding how the r1’s going to look like, and we had quick sketches here and there. Ultimately, I pushed Jesper for using the current color, which is the orange. We do have maybe two or three projects in our minds, but I think by the end of this year, our current focus is to really get this LAM pushed to the next level. So yeah, stay tuned. I think one thing people will realize is that this team does hardware really quick. Because when we start sketching the r1, it was like last year back in November, and we introduced that by January, and we start shipping by April. So if we want to launch the next project, it’s going to be roughly, I don’t know, six to eight months timeframe. Certainly not like a year or two. But that being said, I think... I was having my own community voice chat yesterday. I was talking to people about the current r1 because I really don’t like the current consumer electronics. Like, one year per generation by default, regardless. We’ve seen that from the smartphone companies doing annual release for all this stuff with minor changes. When we started designing the r1, the entire Rabbit OS runs out of cloud. That means that this piece of hardware, even though it’s $199 and not the latest chips, it’s really capable of offloading the future features to this device. So I don’t think r1 is like a one-year lifespan device. Our community does, though. They think they can tweak so many things about it. So in that sense, we’re not in a rush to drop another version of it, but we do have different form factors in our mind at the moment. And is Jesper actively working on those designs, or as chief design officer, is he working on something else? He was literally in our office three days ago. Yeah, we are actively working together. Correct. How much money have you raised so far? That’s a good question. I want to be accurate, but it’s somewhere around $50 million total in the whole lifespan. Last part was $35 million led by Sound Venture and also Khosla Venture, and Amazon Alexa, Foundation Synergist. So last round was $35M, and if you consider all the money together, I think it’s around $50M. When I look at the amount of money that other AI companies are going out to raise, right as we are speaking, OpenAI just raised the biggest round ever in history to go build, obviously, a foundation model, digital god, whatever Sam Altman thinks he’s doing. Do you think you can compete at $35 million a round? No, but I think talking about competition — money is one part of it. I think I’ve considered myself a veteran because I’ve done startups before. I know how it works. Certainly, money is very important, probably most important in the early couple of years. But I think when we talk about competition, we ultimately want to ship products to consumers. Because the way I look at it is that people are not buying electricity. Electricity is basically controlled by — here in California, it’s Southern California Edison, right? You have an address, you have to pay for it regardless of how much electricity you’re using. But I think people are ultimately buying microwaves, cars, motorcycles, televisions. People are buying products powered by electricity. So research-wise, I can say very clearly, we have at this moment of Rabbit, there’s no way that we can compete over OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind and Google, but how can we play the game? We become partners with everyone. Right? So r1 is hosting every single model, the latest models from these guys. Their capabilities combined with our product innovation on the Rabbit OS and all the features offered to our user. So there’s no way we can compete over on a research perspective, but we ship product fast. You saw OpenAI just released the Instant API, as they call it. I was actually invited to the meeting, but I was launching the LAM Playground yesterday, so I couldn’t be there in person. But they’re offering an API for people to build an agent for it. But yesterday, we dropped a LAM Playground, which you can go to any website and just [browse] it by voice. So I think competition is a different magnitude. I think money is definitely important. We hope that we can raise more money, of course. But I think right now, if you talk about competition, we have to play smart. They are good on the research. We are good on converting all the latest research into a piece of product that users can use today. Let’s talk about what that product is today. So right now you have the r1. You can buy it. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware. It is orange. It is very striking. It has a screen, it has a scroll dial, and then it has a connection to your service in the cloud, which goes and does stuff for you. Yep. That costs $199. Are you making money on the sale of each individual r1 unit right now? Correct. What’s the margin? What’s your profit on r1? I have my r1 right here. It’s a very good margin, even though I cannot tell you the details, but it’s over 40 percent. Do you make over 40 percent on the hardware margin of the r1? On hardware margin, which we did the math, we run the calculations. We might have to redo the math because yesterday, literally after dropping the LAN Playground, the server crashed multiple times. So we might need to redo the calculation. But again, first of all, in the beginning we’re making money. Now we have these more powerful features moving forward. I think I haven’t heard a company that went bankrupt because they got a popular service that is so popular that they couldn’t afford cloud bills. I think if you build a good product, there will be — Well, hold on, I can draw that line for you. So it’s $199. You’re making over 40 percent per unit, so that’s between $80 and $90, right? It’s not 50 percent, which would be $100, so it’s a little less. So between $80 and $90 in margin. That margin — you do have to pay your cloud bills, right? Yeah. So is that margin all being fed into your cloud bills? Obviously, we have this dedicated instance with all these cloud competitors. Right? I mean, don’t get me wrong. The Amazon AWS, they’re hosting on AWS, and there’s AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. On the LLM partnerships, we have Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini. So don’t get me wrong, it — That’s a lot of companies that like to make a lot of money. I just want to be... They’re not cheap to partner with, all those companies. They’re not cheap, but what I’m trying to point out is that they are competing so fiercely in a way that they have a lot of good benefits for the early startups. I have to shout out for all these companies. So they really want to figure out a way to help you on board and maybe making your money in the long run, but I think at this current scale, we can totally handle it, yes. So we get great deals from them. So if I buy an r1 from you, you take $90 of margin, or $80 of margin. At what point, how much do I have to use my r1 to turn that negative for you? Because everything I do with an AI, that’s a token. That token costs money. It costs multiple servers. Your bandwidth cost money. It all costs money. How much does a single r1 user have to use their r1 to take up $90 of margin, or $80 of margin from you? So I think of a moderate user using it in a non-robotic way or a non-malicious way, it’s going to be really hard to break down. But — Is that two years worth of usage? One year? Six months? I think it’s definitely over a year and a half. I’m not sure about two years because there’s new features we’re going to implement into this, including LAM Playground and teach mode. But yeah, so I want to share my understanding of this is that yes, we did the mathematics. We are making money. No problem. We wish we can sell more, which we’re hoping that we can sell more. That’s going to definitely help. But I think the target of this whole launch strategy is not set for making X amount of money on first six months. I think there’s other companies that really greedy about how they want to launch their product. I’m not going to even mention a name, so that won’t work. That won’t work. So I think if you look at any new generation of product, if the founder and the company and the board decide to set up a strategy that’s, “Let’s squeeze every single penny out of the user,” it’s not going to work. Because we know AI is very early, and we know that there’s going to be a lot of things that go wrong. In fact, I believe that every company, regardless of if you’re big or small, if you work on the latest AI stuff, the first two weeks, it’s going to be disaster because you’re going to find a lot of the misbehavior about the AI. You’re going to find a lot of the edge cases by the model. So I think the whole thing is too new. There’s no way that we want to charge for subscription. That’s even worse. I don’t like that strategy in general. So even though this sounds very concerning, that, okay, you can easily twist my story or someone might twist my story, be like, “Oh, Rabbit is doing everything great except they’re going bankrupt no matter what” right? I think there’s a very stupid way to think in that sense, because a great innovation, you have to focus on the innovative part first. Then you figure out the money part. If we start figuring out the money part now, none of this is making sense. Really. None of this is making sense. I think there’s other people in the industry that they have a great understanding of everything, and then they decided to release a wallpaper app, charge $4.50 per month. Right? Hopefully that works, I guess. You can go talk to that guy and you say, “Hey, there’s no way you’re going to bankrupt because your money checks, all this equation checks. If you charge for this, you’re going to be making money.” But that’s based on the perspective that the whole logic needs to stand up, right? So I think I’m not really wasting a lot of my time at this point on trying to basically fine tune a little about mathematical equations to make this more like, 20 percent, 50 percent. Obviously, as a startup, we need to survive, even though we have a roller coaster ride since launch. But we’re growing, and we’re surviving, and we’re still pushing the features that none of the other devices, including iPhone can do, which is a very, very good sign. So one, I don’t think anybody has ever linked criticism of Humane to criticism of Marques’ wallpaper app on our show before. Well done. I think Marques has a very different view of where his expertise is and what went wrong with that app and maybe one day we’ll talk to him about it. But my question for you, when you talk about growth and you talk about the unit economics of the Rabbit is that on some curve, the hardware becomes unprofitable for you. Just me having a Rabbit for longer than 18 months becomes unprofitable for you. That’s the moment that you would charge a subscription. You would say “to continue using this thing, it can’t be negative for our company.” And that’s the thing that I’m pushing on here. I think there are multiple solutions to that question. One is that obviously — let’s use R1 for every user for more than 18 months. There’s a couple of solutions. One is that we are going to launch the next generation device, and maybe multiple devices, that are still profitable from the hardware. Two, I think we have this prepared for since day one. From last week we’ve rolled out the alpha of Teach Mode to a very selected group of testers. I would love to give you the access, so please reach out to us later on. We’ll see if we can help you set it up. But we rolled out a very small group of our testers, roughly around 20, 25 people to be honest. And then over the last 72 hours I saw more than probably 200, more than 200 lessons or agents has been created through Teach mode. And if you look at the current Apple ecosystem or Android ecosystem, I think the hardware is not going to be the number one money contributor. It’s really hard to make on top of the margin of the hardware anyway. So at some point you want to convert that into services and software. That doesn’t mean that you’re going to charge a subscription for the device. What I think is very promising is that we are going to slowly roll out the teach mode to beta testers and hopefully by the end of this year we can grand open the teach mode as we promised on day one. So all these lessons created or Rabbits or agents created by each independent users or developers, they can be considered as a new generation of an app store. On that, we can make big money. Using the app store economics of taking 30 percent. I don’t want to invent any — exactly. I think I’m not trying to invent any new business model. I think as a startup it’s very risky to invent your own business model, but there is a very great business model out there which is App Store and that’s contributing like what, 70 percent for the annual income, right? I’m just curious, just as I’ve played with r1s and looked at the device, I’ve always wondered how on earth are you making money at $199? So that makes sense to me. When you think about what the Rabbit is actually doing, I ask it a query, it shows me a beautiful animation on the screen, which is adorable, and it goes off into the web and uses a bunch of APIs. And now the new large action model, which is the news, right? Yesterday you announced the large action model playground. People can watch it work. I’ve seen the LAM click around on The Verge’s website just to read headlines, which is neat. Is that the back end of this, I ask the Rabbit to do something and in the cloud it goes and clicks around on the web for me? So we have to separate two different systems here, maybe three different systems here. Let’s talk before yesterday, because yesterday is really a great milestone. Before yesterday, what happens is that you talk to the r1. We have an intention triage system, which basically we convert this audio to a text, we send that text to our LLM providers, and then we have an intention triage system. From there, after the LLM understand the intention we send to different APIs or different features. There are a lot of feature which is on device, right? Like set a smart timer or something like that. Or there’s a simple question, but we think that there’s other services or model probably answers better than the default LLM. So sometimes we send a particular query to Perplexity. Sometimes we send a particular query to Wolfram Alpha. So you can understand as intention triage system is dispensing on this to different destinations and then the relative features will trigger. But after yesterday, we have this playground and that’s a first stepping stone towards what we really want to create, which is a generic cross-platform agent system. It has to be generic, which on this case it is a generic. It is not cross-platform yet because it handles only a website. It will be cross-platform very soon. But with this generic website agent system, essentially you can just talk to Rabbit, be like, “Hey, go to ABC website or go somewhere and then help me do this.” So that’s exactly how we wish to design a product, and I think everyone in the industry is heading towards this direction, which is you say something, we understand you and we help you do it. And what happens as we put windows on the Rabbit hole that you can see is that the agent will break down different steps. I’m going to Google first. I’m searching for The Verge, I’m clicking to The Verge’s home website. I’m trying to find this title as you requested. I’m clicking the button to share this. And in theory you can chain multiple steps, infinite steps, follow up queries to the system. So I’ll gave you an example. I think I showed this to another reporter, it’s “hey, go to Reddit first and search for what are people recommending for the 2024 best TV 4K HDR. Get that model, then go to Best Buy, add that to my cart. If Best Buy is out of stock, then search on Amazon. If they both are out of stock, get me the second recommended model.” So you can actually chain different queries and you can pause it, you can add, you can tweak it, you can fine tune it. So it’s really just like a playground. You can freely explore the system and the system is fairly good enough to do daily tasks. And people are obviously developers and our hackers — white hat hackers of course — are giving us impressive showcases. There are people using the LAM playground to create an app just by talking to r1 because there are third party AI destinations that you can just use prompt and create an app and download the code and stuff like that. So it’s really amazing to see all this great showcases just within actually precisely 24 hours. So I want to make the marker between yesterday and the day before it, right? You announced the Rabbit at CES in January with the LAM, but it wasn’t there. Why announce it without its fundamental enabling feature? It is not accurate. I want to take this opportunity to address that. If you go to the connections, now we have seven apps. By day one we have four apps. Those are the first iteration of LAM, which is not a generic technology. We never on the CES claimed that you can now go to Amazon to order something. We said we are working towards this piece and today there’s four apps that you can connect. We are going to add more services. And over the past couple of months we did add three more services. So as of today there are seven services in total, then we keep working on the current LAM Playground and when the time is right, we swap it. So there’s a lot of debate saying LAM wasn’t there. That is not true. I can trace back to where this rumor starts is where there are people hacking into the r1. They saw r1 is fundamentally powered by an Android system on the local device, and obviously that should be the case. It would be more sketchy if it’s not Android. So at the bottom of it is an Android system and they dump the code, which — you can do that. In fact, every good piece of hardware in history has been hacked. So someone goes into this and jailbreaks the r1, which I guess every piece of hardware is jailbreakable at some point. Obviously, that’s flattering to us. If you build a form factor and no one even bothered to jailbreak it, it’s probably not a good form factor anyway. So people jailbreak it, find out the Android code, they dump the Android code to another media and they say, hey, there’s nothing about AI here. There’s nothing about LAM here. Of course, because all the stuff is in AWS. That’s where the rumor starts. And then there’s a lot of media and they just take that piece and reiterate that. The apps you started with, Spotify, DoorDash, there are a few others. Those are APIs, right? You were using their APIs. You were actually opening Spotify on the web in Chrome and clicking on it. Yes. Yes. Because what do you mean — Why? There is no API — That’s the most brittle way to use Spotify I can think of — There is no API. There is no API. You made a smart speaker. Spotify can run on smart speakers and other kinds — That’s a partnership. That’s a partnership. Go to Spotify, read their documentations. There is a specific line is that you cannot use API to build a voice-activated application. Literally. So Spotify right now on the r1, when I ask to play a song, it goes and opens Spotify on the web somewhere — Goes to the window. Yes. And then you’re re-streaming the audio to my device through your service. Correct. Correct. Yes. Does Spotify know that you’re doing this? Yes. And they’re okay with that? We had a conversation. They realize this is agent behavior. And we said, look, we ask the user to log in on your website and they’re a 100 percent legitimate user and they’re a paid user. And when we do the trick, we help them click the button. I’ve always been very curious about this. I’ve been dying to ask you these questions. So I ask my r1 to play a song. Somewhere in AWS, a virtual machine fires up, opens a web browser, opens Spotify, logs into my Spotify account using my credentials, clicks around on Spotify, pushes a button to play a song, and then you capture that audio and re-stream it to me on my r1? Everything is accurate except we don’t help you log in. You have to log in for yourself and we don’t save your connection. But the part where you are re-streaming audio that Spotify is playing to your virtual machine to me, you’re doing that? We are basically giving everyone a virtual machine, which is a VNC, which is 100 percent within policy, and you have the right to access that VNC. And on that VNC, we basically work directly on a website just like today’s LAM Playground. So we’re not getting the audio from the server from Spotify or somewhere else. We’re basically going to the Spotify website and playing — and do the things for you and play that song for you. Okay, but where do the bits go? The bits come to the virtual machine and then they come from the virtual machine to my Rabbit. Correct. So you are re-streaming the song to me. I’m not re-streaming the song to you. I’m basically presenting the VNC directly to your r1. Wait, explain how that works. Maybe I’m not technical enough to understand how that works. You’re presenting the VNC to my r1. Correct. So it is running locally on my computer? With no UI. Okay, I see what you mean. So I’m logged into a cloud computer. The r1 is the client to a cloud computer. And Spotify is playing on that cloud computer and the r1 is taking that audio. Okay. That raises a million extra questions, right? First of all, I see where you’re going. Okay? Before you go deeper, I just want to say first of all, we’re not using API. Second of all to say LAM is not there, that’s false claim. Because we have all these services, if you really pay attention to their documentation, there is no API for like DoorDash. There is no API for Uber. But I just want to be clear, that’s a choice those companies have made to prevent companies like Rabbit from automating their services and disintermediating their services from the user. So as you think about these agent models going out onto the web, however they’re expressed, whether it’s the LAM, whether it’s whatever you’re doing before the LAM Playground hit, all of those companies are going to have a point of view on whether agents can use their services in this way. That’s pretty unsettled. Yes. And I’m curious, you have a few services, they might’ve just said, okay, let’s see how this goes. But over time you’re going to enter into a much more complicated set of negotiations that will actually be probably determined by the big companies making deals, right? You can see how OpenAI or Microsoft or Amazon would make a deal to have DoorDash accessible by agents and DoorDash would say, “we’ve made this deal, you can’t be accessible.” How do you solve that problem? It’s not a problem for now. We’ll see how this problem evolves, but I remember when Apple is relatively not so big, not as big as today. When I read the Steve Jobs book, there’s one chapter. He said, okay, “go talk to Sony, from tomorrow 99 cents per track,” right? Remember that moment? So at some point this level of negotiation needs to be happening. I’m not sure if we’re leading this or someone else is leading this, but this is the working proof that we’re not using API, and I don’t think the services are not building API just because they’re trying to prevent people from automating the company. It’s just because API to them is not making money. And they for sure will love to set up a negotiation in some phase later when we grow bigger. You know, we tried to reach out to Uber, we did, before launch. They were like, “who are you? You’re too small.” That’s it. “We don’t care.” And so then you have Uber on the r1 now, that’s opening the Uber desktop app? No, the Uber website, which is very janky, which is very — That’s what I’m asking. Sorry. What I meant by desktop app is in the web browser you’re calling an Uber. If you’re running on Android, why not open an Android virtual machine and use the Android app? It is a little bit more technical to achieve that, which we are working on the other platforms. I think I showed a vary select group of people a working prototype that LAM is operating on the desktop OS such as Linux with all the local apps. So we’re definitely heading in that direction. Is there a possibility they can detect the fact that these are not human users, but in fact agent users? I guess there’s always a way that you can detect, but I think the question is — this is actually a very good topic that we’re talking about here. Think about CAPTCHAs. Sure. LAM playground or any capable AI models now can go there and solve text-based CAPTCHAs. So their old systems to prevent automated systems like this are currently failing. This is an industry effort to push everyone in the industry to rethink about — now with this AI, now with all these agents, how their business is going to reform or how all these policies need to be changed? I do agree, this is a very complicated topic, but what I can see is that this is not Rabbit doing some really fancy magic here. Every company is doing this. We have other agent companies even the GPTs are doing this. So this is a new wave emerging for all this old services that they have to think about. But I can tell you my personal experience dealing with scenarios like this, like when we first started building one of the first smart speakers back in 2013 — all this music labels, they don’t care. They didn’t care until everyone’s building smart speakers, they’re like, ‘okay, we have to resell the whole copyrights for this particular form factor.” I guess at the end of day, it’s about money. They want to sell the same copyrights to as many form factories as they want, if there’s a popular one. So we’re okay to have this kind of negotiations, but certainly like you said, there’s bigger companies that are doing similar things or even more advanced things that needs to be addressed. I give you another example like Siri and Microsoft, there’s a feature called Microsoft Recall, which they pulled back that feature now and I think they relaunched it. Which is very aggressive, that is taking screenshots of your local computer. So this is what I saw happening in AI in these early days. There’s going to be a lot of different takes and tries and eventually people will reconcile and agree on single piece of terms and agreements. But if you check how we automate the website to their interface, the most important part is we don’t create fake users. We don’t create spam users. We don’t log in on your behalf and you are you. The way I help you to do things is by help you click the buttons and mouse. It’s equivalent of, if I want my buddy to help me — I’ll give you example. So if I’m busy, I’m about to head into a meeting, I want my buddy to help me order a burger from DoorDash. All I need to do is I unlock my phone, I pass my phone to my guy and my guy helped me click that. And in this process, I’m not sharing my credentials to my buddy. I’m not telling him my phone password, I’m not telling him my DoorDash password. I’m not even sharing my credit card info. All he has to do is just add to the cart and click confirm. That’s it. So this guy is the equivalent of the first generation of LAM, which is unfortunately we don’t like it. So that’s why we work so hard. Now we have Playground, which is a more generic technology. Well, let me ask you about that difference between the first generation of LAM and the playground. The playground sounds like the thing you’ve always wanted to build. You actually have an agent that can look at web pages, understand them, take action on them. The first one, it might have been a LAM in the broader definition, but as technology it was expressed as testing software that was moving in an automated way through these interfaces. You weren’t actually understanding the interfaces. You were able to just navigate them. Because that’s pretty normal robotic process automation stuff. Were you just building on that kind of technology while the LAM came into existence? No, no. No? Okay. We’re working on neuro-symbolic, right? So the idea is that — But even in the first versions? Yeah. The question I’ve always had is, what happens if Spotify — before the LAM existed because I understand that the claim is that this version can understand every website — but if Spotify changed its interface or DoorDash changed its interface, Rabbit was kind of getting tripped up, right? I’ll tell you, Spotify changes its interface all the time and I think in the past six months, five months since the first LAM was adding the Spotify with the connection since launch. I think we probably put Spotify under maintenance for maybe two times, one hour in total. That’s a very hard proof. That’s a hard proof, but I — just take this for what it’s worth, I think that means it’s not good enough, right? The Spotify app on my phone never goes down for maintenance, and if the claim is the agent can go take actions for me, I have to rely on that at 100 percent. No — And so I think the question for me that I have, this whole thing, is the delta between what you want to do, which is have agents go and crawl the web for me and the reality of what we can do now. Actually the middle ground is APIs, the middle ground is not so brittle. You — Okay — It makes more sense to me that the agent would, instead of using an interface designed for my eyes, use an interface designed for computers. I really want to laugh hard. Okay. Really. Two things. I disagree that Spotify is not working good. Spotify has been working amazing. Sure. Five months, maybe two times we put it under maintenance and the total amount of time put under maintenance is probably under one hour. You can ask any r1 users. That’s not through API, which is impressive. That’s through agent. I’m — That’s through agent to handle to — I get that it’s impressive for an agent. I’m just saying that API — You said it’s not — I said it’s not — You said it’s not good. Good enough. I said it’s not good enough. It is not good enough. Right? Where’s the curve where it’s 100 percent? Okay, now that’s my — Because the API is 100 percent. That’s my second part. Yes, API is 100 percent, but you’re relying on, they gave you the API that’s stable, that works, that never break- I’m the user, I don’t care. That’s what I’m getting at: as the user, why should I care? The user doesn’t need to care. We need to care. Okay. We need to care and we need to care because we checked what are the good APIs we can use, don’t get me wrong, Perplexity API’s has being great. Sure. OpenAI’s API breaks every day or two and they said , “We observe an issue.” You can follow the, Is ChatGPT Down? It’s very detailed, how many breaks per day, it’s, I guess more than 10 on average that the ChatGPT API breaks or is unstable, whatever it takes. We have a notifier. So, first of all, API is not stable. It is not stable. Sure. And you have to chase for the services people want. We want to offer this music feature and we think Spotify has the best experience overall, and we want to chase for this partnership and we’re still chasing for this partnership. But to talk from a technical perspective, why I said I don’t like APIs is because — think about Alexa. Alexa speakers are all using APIs and you literally have to go there and negotiate. Because like I said, today, not everyone’s opening APIs, a lot of the traditional services don’t have APIs, and then startups, for a startup it’s impossible. wWen you go talk to them, they think you’re too small, right? We did that, we just did that to everyone. They think we’re too small, they don’t care, so we can’t get an API, Does that mean that we’re not going to figure out an alternative way to make it work? No, hell no! We’re going to make it work and this is exactly how we make it work. So we care about users to use this feature. We don’t care about how to do it. In fact, because we know that you don’t care how this has been done, I don’t want to spend six months, eight months suited up to talk to Spotify people and Uber people, and one by one, let’s do that. Well the promise here is you’re going to eventually have a general purpose LAM that is just using the web for you, right? You said you hand your phone to a buddy, which is why you can make the Rabbit device and just talk to it and it goes off and does stuff in the general case. The enormous Death Star that everyone sees is that Apple has announced substantially the same feature for Siri on the iPhone. Yeah. And Apple can get the deals and Apple can pull developers into an API relationship locally on the phone with Siri, and Apple honestly can just burn money until it chooses not to build a car or whatever it wants to do. And getting people to buy another device that doesn’t just fall back to the Spotify app on iOS when it breaks seems very challenging. How do you overcome that? Because if the technology isn’t 100 percent better 100 percent of the time, that feels like a challenging sale. Yeah, this is the fun part of the game, really. How do you win the game? I think, first of all, speaking for myself, I’ve sold my company before when I was 25. I don’t want to build another app. I should chase my same dream because I really think that the grand vision that I have and our team was working on is actually the current direction everyone’s chasing. And it just feels so bad if you don’t chase the same dream no matter how hard it is, really, and in reality, we feel blessed and happy to say the exact situation because we don’t have any serious competitors from startups to be honest. When everyone — Well there’s one, and they seem like a pretty spectacular failure, right? Yes. Humane launched with a lot of money and a big T-Mobile partnership and a subscription fee and Time magazine and all that stuff and it doesn’t seem like that has gone very well. So I said as of right now I don’t think we have serious competitors from startup and then when we talk about competitors, obviously there’s Apple, there’s every big company out there, including OpenAI. So first of all, I think this is good for us because it validates our direction is absolutely correct and I also am curious about — what are going to be the definitive routes for the generic agent technology because different people in the industry might have different ideas. There are still debatable states, there is no eval for agent systems yet, there is no very good eval yet, and you can see a lot of different research houses and companies trying different routes. Obviously there’s API routes like GPT’s, which doesn’t really take off, there’s pure neuro-symbolic routes, there’s Haber routes, there’s all this multi-modality. So we’re still in the phase of everyone trying their own recipe and hopefully that can become a definitive recipe, including Apple. I think the benefit for Apple to do that is that yes, they understand the user better, much, much better than any companies out there and they have infinite money, theoretically infinite money, and they have the very closed ecosystem. The way that they’re rolling this out is that they have this SDK called App Intent, right? So different companies or app developers need to choose to enroll or not enroll with that to have the new Siri to control stuff. I guess my relative advantage as a small group, as Rabbit, is that we move fast. We move fast and we keep growing. I think if we put all the cards on our table, we had a spectacular launch. We are the most sold dedicated hardware yet, and we have made good profit, we fix all the day one problems and the company actually quadrupled the size. So we’re growing, we’re moving fast, and now we drop this. Like you said, put a marker between today and yesterday. I think today I can say, a lot of things that you can do on r1, you cannot do it on a iPhone, I believe eventually everyone will be able to come to the same solution that all the devices can do kind of like similar stuff, but I firmly believe at least this remaining half of the year or the Q4 of 2024 and probably till Q1 2025, it is still a game of you have something that they don’t have, versus you guys all have the similar stuff, who’s done better? So I think relatively we have a good six to eight months headstart, we have our little room here, but obviously I also believe when a big company wants to kill a startup, they have a million ways to kill you. That’s just the reality. People keep talking to me and asking questions, “What happens if the risk is too high? What happens if the company dies?” I really don’t think that all these questions matter because we’re on this course, we’re going to see the end, whether it’s a good end or bad end, and I don’t think any answer to these questions will change our course to be honest. I can go here and tell you and be a cry baby like, “This is super hard, this is impossible. Everyone in the industry can kill us easily, or a YouTube reviewer can kill us by posting a review.” It doesn’t change the course because we are doing things, we’re launching, we’re shipping things, we’re moving forward. So it’ll be interesting to see what Apple came from. I was on the Apple iPhone upgrade program, so I automatically get a new iPhone every year by paying the same monthly fee, but I really don’t find any reason to upgrade that because people are talking about Rabbit being launched too early, now you have a company like Apple, if you go to the... What is that called? Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles where it’s close to here or, I guess Mission Street in San Francisco. You go to any major cities, you see these gigantic posters, billboards that Apple put there, right? iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, what are the other lines underneath? It says Apple Intelligence. Is it ready? Is it out? No. Let me talk about growth for a second. You mentioned you quadrupled and I guess you mean by employee size? Yeah. You told Fast Company last month the r1 is only being used daily by 5,000 people. Is that higher or lower than you expected? First of all, you saw that article from I guess Verge? I think — No, it’s Fast Company, that’s what it says. Yeah, no, yeah, but there’s — I’m reading it, I’m looking at it. No, but there’s a Verge [article] says r1 only has 5,000 users daily, which is from- Well that’s a quote from you. First of all, I think that what I said there can be misinterpreted. What I said is that if you go look at the data dump right now, you probably will find 5,000 people using r1. At least 5,000 people. I’m just going to quote you. Fast Company. “Lyu said, ‘Right now around 5,000 people use the r1 daily.’” I said it can be misinterpreted. Okay? Okay. First of all, I think we saw a very steady growth of all the people interacting with r1 and each time with new features, there’s going to be more people using it. I will give you some numbers that I want to throw to you and maybe I can share very detailed usage sometime in the future. First of all, there are about 5 percent of people that have their r1, they’re not happy, that return it, less than 5 percent. Sure. Which is a very good number, and I think the top features that people are using are asking questions and vision and all that, and we really are hoping for people to discover more use cases, but unfortunately we have like four or seven apps on the connections, that’s one of the bottleneck. So if you check for the total query, most of the cases you ask a question, you forget about it, so it’s not about how many times you ask r1, it’s about what kind of task you ask r1 and is r1 actually going to help you? So I guess, yeah, very unfortunate, it seems that that’s a misinterpretation. So what’s the number? What’s the daily active number? We’ll issue the correction tomorrow, what is it? I will go back and get you a very accurate number, but I can tell you yesterday our server actually crashed, so I think — Is it double? Is it 10,000? Is it 25,000? Oh, yesterday our cloud cost actually, I think... Actually, let me check right here, because I can check right here. This is why I love having a founder on the show. Okay, so the past one day is 33,760. Okay. So 33,760, yes. So almost 34K yesterday. Okay. 34,000 active users yesterday. Okay. Yeah, and — What percentage of your sales is that? Yesterday? Yeah, 33,760 people. What percentage of your total sales is that? I think we delivered more than 100,000 units, and that should be around 33 percent, 34 percent. Sure, that makes sense, and that I’m assuming yesterday, because it was a launch of LAM playground, this is a big spike. Yes. What were the days before that? So past two days, 5206, so if you minus 33, that’s another 20,000. Wait, I’m sorry, I don’t think I followed. You said numbers, but I don’t think I followed them. Past two days, say it again. So past two days, 5206, so — That’s the total of two days? Correct. Okay, and one day is with the LAM playground on, so okay, I got what you’re saying. Correct. So you’re saying it’s 5,000 active users at any time, not daily. Correct. Okay. And then you’re getting about 20,000 users daily and then we’ll see if that goes up — Correct. ... because of the LAM playground. Correct. Then there’s an article by The Verge that used that title, 5,000, which is wrong. I can tell you, that’s wrong. That’s very wrong. That’s me saying — Well, you tell Fast Company and then we will update it, but we — Well, he was a — ... ran your quote in the magazine, so we feel good about that. He wasn’t there and he... he or she. That journalist wasn’t there and that’s not what I said in the quote, okay? Welcome back. So you heard all that back and forth about Rabbit’s daily active users, and CEO Jesse Lyu saying he’d get us a better number. I asked the company to clear it up, and what Jesse actually said to Fast Company was that at any given time, Rabbit has 5,000 users. The Fast Company article has been corrected, and we’ll use Jesse’s number of between 20,000 and 34,000 daily active users, which is between – which is still substantially less than the 100,000 units sold. Now that we have the number, we’ll run it, but my question to you is, you’ve got to sell more r1s, you’ve got to get more people who’ve already bought them to continue using it, and you are, in fact, whether or not Apple Intelligence has arrived or not, it will arrive in some fashion in the coming weeks. There’s a report just a week or so ago that Jony Ive is working with Sam Altman and OpenAI on a hardware device. Something will happen with Humane, something will happen with Google, something will happen with Samsung. As that universe of competitors expands, it feels like the core technology you’re betting on is being able to automate a VNC with a large action model, right? You’re going to open up user sessions for people in the cloud and then your LAM is going to go click around on the web for them and that will get you out of the challenges of needing to strike API deals with various companies, with other kinds of deals, copyright deals with various companies, whatever you might need. Is that durable? The idea that this will keep Rabbit away from needing all of the deals that the big companies will just go pay and get? Because that’s the thing that I think about the most. I can think of 10 companies that came up with a technical solution to a legal problem, and even if the technical solution was amazing, the legal problem eventually caught up with them. We’re confident that this technology is the current technology route that it will work, and I haven’t yet seen another approach that actually makes any generic agent system work in any other manner. That doesn’t mean that we’re locked in to one technical path. If you talk to any company, it’s probably not a smart idea to say, “Hey, we just bet on this for the next 10 years.” The technology changes so fast, you have to adapt. But right now, I think we’re off to a good start, we launched a concept with playground with free of charge that you can explore so that we understand how this system can be improved. In fact, I believe the speed can be improved very fast, but we’re not here to say, “Hey, we’re stuck into this.” We do have patents about this, but we’re not saying, “Hey, we think this is the correct path to go.” I don’t think anyone in the AI industry can give you a very definitive answer, be like, “Hey, if you just do this, here’s the structure. This is going to guarantee you the best result in the long run.” I think that’s not a good way to think of it, but yeah, I agree. Everyone in the industry are experimenting with something new and a lot of companies that we saw are going to, like you said, run into some sort of legal problems. There’s music generation platforms, there’s — I mean, this feels like the story of the AI industry broadly, right? There’s a YouTube training video can be used by this or that. There’s all sorts of things like this. But I think it’s not just the builders are adapting, the industry are going to adapt to the builders too. At some point, there’s going to be a conclusion that, “Okay, this is a new policy, these are new terms that we need to follow.” Are you building to that goal? I think, again, this is just the big question I’m thinking about all of these things. Basically every AI product is a technical solution that is ahead of wherever the legal system is or wherever the business deals are. At some point Spotify might show up on your doorstep and say, “You know what? We’re not going to allow agents. It has to be a human user, and we’re going to change our terms of service to say it has to be a human user.” DoorDash might say it, whoever might say it. Are you ready for that outcome? Do you have the budget socked away to go lawyer up and fight that fight? No. At the moment we don’t have the resources to fight that fight, and at the moment, that’s not a real threat to us because they said we’re too small. [Laughs] Fair enough. When do you think the turn hits? I don’t think that it’s a dead end for us, right? No, I’m saying when do you think it’s a turn? When do you think that becomes a conversation about whether you can have agent users or human users? Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. I don’t think that they are not willing to change their terms. And I think it’s unlikely they’re going to put terms like, it has to be a human. It cannot be. There’s a lot of automation tools out there already. There’s no turning back. I think what they would like to work with any companies, including us, is that when they see a popular demand from this new kind of agent technology, they want to charge for it, and then we ask our user and us to pay for them, and that’s a business deal. That’s more like money terms. That’s what I can see. But as for now, we’re not breaking any of their terms and agreements. And if they change the terms and agreements tomorrow, we’ll take a look and we’ll see how we adapt. But the agent is out there already. There’s a lot of agents running already, so I think there’s no turning back, and it’s very unlikely to say, “Hey, we are going to stop agents using our services.” That’s not going to happen. Think on the longest timeline you can, let’s assume everything works out and it’s all solved. How much time and money is it going to take before the general purpose agent you’re trying to build is a hundred percent reliable and can just do all the things that we all imagine them being able to do? I might have a different opinion here. I think foundation models like OpenAI’s, obviously they’re raising a crazy amount of money. I think we take benefit from what they’ve been working on, because their primary services is selling their models as APIs, which saves a lot of money. We don’t want to recreate the wheel retraining an LLM. I think it might not be as scary as a lot of people might think. I think there’s a huge gap between converting the latest technology into a piece of product versus pushing for a more advanced technology. Obviously I’m very proposed to do high-end research. We want to have a research house here set up at the same scale as OpenAI and DeepMind, even though they’re already far, far behind. But I think what we’re trying to do right now at this current scale, because here’s the money we have. We don’t have $1 billion, we don’t have $2 billion. We have this very limited budget. Is that how can we convert the latest technology and research, and build to a product that we can ship early and collect feedback and learn from it? So a lot of people have different definitions of AGI. I don’t really talk about this term because I think so many people have so many definitions for it. But I do think that AI understands what you say and can help you do things, and maybe here we’re talking about virtually help you click buttons and stuff. There are a lot of companies doing humanoid android that they’re actually giving a hand and legs for the AI to do things. I think it is an entire humanity’s effort, and a lot of the resources can be shared instead of each company has to go raise for this amount of money and take that amount of time to achieve the same goal. So it’s really hard to say, but we know we need more money and resources, that’s for sure. But I think you’ve seen how efficient this team has been performing from seven people, 17 people till today. We raised obviously much less than Humane or any big companies out there. I think it’s actually one of our advantages that we can do things in a relatively cost-efficient way and fast. Timeline wise though — again, assuming everything goes your way, is it a year from now that you can build on all the foundation models and all the other investment in this thing? Just does whatever I ask on the web, is it five years? What do you think? I think the AI model will get very smart very fast, but I think we’re talking about a generational shift. I think obviously we don’t want a 2024 piece of technology operating on eBay’s website, which is basically designed back in 1990, right? So I think a lot of the infra needs to be refreshed, and the biggest gap as I can see here is productionized. So I think in our roadmap we think that it’s very likely that we can get all this separate piece of technology we have like LAM playground, Teach Mode and rabbitOS at some point, maybe next year, merged into a new rabbitOS 2.0. And that actually will push a huge step forward towards this generic goal. But my general take is that the AI model is smart enough, but the action part is a lot of infrastructure. There’s a huge gap between research and productionized, so that’s what we learned. So I will say I’m very optimistic in the three years term, but I think, like I said, right now and starting next year is everyone trying different approaches, and we’ll see which one works, but I think we’re confident on the approach we’re take right now. I just want to end by asking about form factors. Obviously the Rabbit is a very distinctive piece of hardware. People really like the design. We’ve seen just a lot of interesting glasses lately. The idea that we’re all going to work cameras on our face and someone’s going to build the display. Do you think that’s correct? I was wearing the Meta Ray-Bans yesterday. I was like, why would I wear these all the time? I’d rather have a thing. I am not against any form factors. In fact, I really think that there will be a lot of form factors. But when we were trying to design r1, the reason is that we know it’s not going to be a smartphone because we know people are going to do a lot of other things on smartphones, which the current AI cannot do. So we deliberately avoided the smartphone phone factor. Talking about pins with lasers and glasses — I have different comments for each phone factor because there’s no universal rules here. Let’s talk about pins. I think my general pushback for making it a pin with a laser like Humane, I think first of all, I think it’s really cool, but I think it’s too risky. You are trying to offer a new way of utilizing your technology, to have user use the software. That’s already new to them, and you don’t want to just introduce a sci-fi type of gear. So two new things stacked together that’s too risky. So if you look at r1, it’s a very familiar design. You know there’s a button you know you’re going to push, you know the wheel probably can scroll. There’s a screen, you can look at things. So the r1 form factor is very conservative, in the sense that it de-risks the software. It’s just like, people haven’t figured out how to interact in a virtual world, and all of a sudden back in 2016, there’s 200 different companies making goggles and they all failed. So I think I’m very, very conservative on the hardware form factor. Talking about glasses, that’s a different story. I think your skull actually grows to fit the frame, not the other way around. I used to wear prescription frames. I know the pain, your skull is growing to fit the glass frame, not the other way around. So I think there is really no generic fit on the glass frame. I was having fun with my design team joking, I’m like, “Maybe if we do the glass, we’ll probably do the Dragon Ball style,” like the power reader or whatever that is. Like the old Google Glass form factor? I can’t wrap my head around “I have to put a frame that doesn’t fit.” So we’ll see. I think the current smartphone is perfect. I really like the slate of a glass or a screen form factor, but the real problem here is not about the form factor. The problem is about the apps, right? Because now we see all this agent technology, AI stuff, and they’re doing things that apps are doing, and they’re doing things that apps can’t do, so I think the problem is with apps. I forgot to ask you the main question. You’ve had a number of startups, you’ve done a number of things, you have a big idea here. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions? I am a very intuitive person. I like to trust my intuition on big directions like what’s going to happen in the long run. But meanwhile, I’m quite conservative in that I hate to predict things. So I think when people replay this episode, they’ll hear probably that I got really tricked by some of your questions. It’s just my brain couldn’t work for predictions. It’s that I don’t like to make predictions — like what happens if this happens, if that happens, what do you think? When I manage my team, I tell people, “We make decisions based on current facts, and we find the best solutions to it.” If you spend too much time — at least, if I spend too much time thinking about what if Apple knocks on your door, what you’re going to do? What if A happens, then B happens, then C happens, what you’re going to do? Most likely you’re going to get a different strategy, right? Because if you think if B is a solution to A — when A happens, you just do B. But there are other types of people they’re like, “Hold on, have you ever thought of when A happens then D happens, then E happens, then F happens, are you still going to do B?” If you think that way, probably not. So I just choose not to predict a lot of what ifs, and I make short, clear, concise decisions based on current facts. And in fact, if you do the recap for what we launched back in the CES, it was probably the best timing. The price is probably just right, the color probably just right, and the decisions of not negotiating, spending six months negotiating with T-Mobile is probably just right. I make current decisions and that’s my style. And I talk to people, everyone talks to me. I told everyone in my team, they can find me anytime. Talk to me anytime. I spend a lot of time talk to my people. We’re, in general, just a very real team, down to earth. I really don’t like some of the other types of startups that spend too much time enjoying the feeling, if you understand what I’m indicating. But there are a lot of people that they say, “Oh, I’m a founder. I’m cool.” No, I’ve grown enough to get rid of that. Probably the same way as if I’m 21, 22, but now I’m 34. Startups are really tough. It’s a war. It’s about survival. It is really, really tough. And it doesn’t really matter if others want to do something. You have to survive, and just surviving by your own is tough in any sense. So that’s why a lot of people ask me — I get asked a lot like, “Okay, what if they do this? What if they do that?” Well, end of the day, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do your thing and they will react to it. I think it’s fair to say that with Rabbit and other startups like us, the biggest companies like Apple, they react to us. They react to us in a very hostile way, a very unusual way that they have this new phone, but all those things are still not there. We’re making very small dent, but that even doesn’t matter. I think for us, we care about our customers. One thing I want to say is that yes, there are a lot of misinformation, there are haters, there are all that feedbacks, criticisms. If you talk to the r1 user, they’re happy. That’s what I care. That’s what I care. Otherwise, there will be a lot of returns, there will be a lot of refunds. We have less than 5 percent return. Put that term in any consumer market electronics device, it’s a good benchmark, and we are going to keep releasing all the stuff. We pushed 17 OTA within five months. The other company pushed like, what? 2, 3, 4, 5 OTAs. So I really hope people can see us — we’re a bunch of underdogs. Our solution isn’t perfect, but it is David versus Goliath on day one because it’s a reality, and don’t expect perfect stuff from us because we are not perfect. We raise very little amount of money and we’re a small team, but we move fast. What we can guarantee is that when Rabbit shows you something, you probably couldn’t even find somewhere else. Just like the hardware, just like the playground or even the very janky day one version of LAM. We are the first company that has Apple Music can be streamed to our device. Yeah. Does Apple, because you’re opening it on the web? Yeah. I mean, I don’t get legal documents to my door. Maybe I will get one, but maybe they think we’re too small, but we do things in our way. I guess, that’s what I want to say. We’re really down to the ground team. That’s my style. Yeah. Jesse, thank you so much for coming to Decoder and being so game to answer these questions. I really appreciate it. Yeah, thank you so much.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's work-from-office mandate aims to help new recruits learn company work culture

Full Content:
Amazon Inc Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy's decision to bring back employees to the office full-time shows the executive's concern that new recruits don't understand the company culture, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Monday, October 7. Last month, Jassy surprised the employees with a memo instructing them to start coming to the office five days a week from January. Amazon currently lets many employees work from home two days a week, as per the report. The order stunned many of Amazon's more than 350,000 employees and restarted a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. They wonder if this was Jassy’s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. The CEO expressed his intention to reduce management layers in efforts to reduce bureaucracy, which, according to him, was slowing down Amazon, as per the agency report. The senior leadership made the part change, as they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people aware of the development cited by the agency. Jassy mentioned the word “culture” a dozen times in his memo. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” he wrote. “You have to work at it all the time,” according to the report. Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser refused to comment beyond the CEO's memo, as per the report. Amazon, which sees itself as operating like a startup, has long acknowledged that its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid deck slides. According to the report, there’s a strong preference for analysis of data and trends and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate. Amazon is also famous for its tough environment and aggressive deadlines, as employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, according to founder Jeff Bezos who put it to the company's first recruits. According to the CEO's colleagues, Jassy who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches. After succeeding Bezos three years ago, he’s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he explains each of Amazon’s leadership principles, said the report. Amazon doubled its headcount and reduced the requirement for recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Company executives have been openly saying that fresh grads, new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company's culture which cannot be effectively conveyed through videoconferences or chat windows. “Culture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,” said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, at a press event last week. “And that’s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you’re over a video call,” according to the agency report. Keeping in mind the new schedule would be controversial, senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people aware of the development. The company denied the policy was designed to push employees out, according to the report. Workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider, in internal surveys. Some of the employees have already resigned and others are seeking work in other places. The last time the company ordered its employees to come back to the office for work, employees walked out at the company's Seattle headquarters, as per the report. It is unclear whether the employees will make a similar attempt again. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: 5 Stocks To Own For The 2024 Elections & Beyond!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections.

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

INSIDE: Economic growth could slowly pick up in the U.S. and globally, as inflationary pressures continue to ease, with the Fed joining the rate-cut “party,” which could lead to even stronger corporate earnings growth following this year’s robust gains The megatrends behind the secular bull market in stocks aren’t going anywhere, with the tech revolution, the AI boom, the medical revolution, the expansion of global trade, and the emergence of China's and India’s middle class fueling global growth in the coming decade The U.S. economy’s relative strength will likely persist, and there is no reason to believe that domestic stocks will give up their global dominance, meaning that the U.S. market is still the place to be for outsized returns After hitting new record highs and consolidating their gains, the major indices are primed for further gains, leaving the key technical levels of 40K in the Dow, 18K in the Nasdaq, and 5,500 in the S&P 500 behind for good following the elections Growth-focused companies could take center stage as financing costs drop, and despite two stellar years, tech stocks might continue their dominance Cyclical stocks, the Dow, and small-caps, which have already started to flex their muscles, could catch up with the market-leading Nasdaq as the impact of easing monetary conditions increases Volatility could continue to trend lower, with a few spikes above 20 in the VIX, corresponding to orderly profit-taking events in stocks, which should still be treated as buying opportunities Five Stocks To Own Going Into The Elections & Beyond 2024 began exactly how bulls hoped it would, with stocks extending last year's technical breakout to new record highs, thanks to the tech sector’s continued leadership and the bull market’s broadening base. Overseas stocks joined the party in earnest, too, with even European equities eclipsing their prior highs, despite a mild recession on the Old Continent, proving that, against all odds, a global bull market began in 2023. Despite the promising long-term trends and the early-year rally, geopolitical tensions, lingering inflation fears, and the market-leading Nasdaq’s extremely overbought momentum readings led to several months of sideways price action and a deep, albeit brief, selloff in August. While the past few months were frustrating for investors, they likely set the stage for something big toward the end of the year. Although the pre-election uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, this autumn could provide one of the best opportunities to load up on stocks in years. The positive backdrop doesn't mean that you should ignore stock picking and buy stocks without thinking. In fact, we are still in the “New Golden Age of Stock Picking” that started in 2022, and this year's strong divergences between the main sectors prove just that. But, before diving deep into the Gorilla’s top picks, let's see the fundamental and technical drivers behind the bull market in detail! Bullish Technicals In The Wake Of A Frustrating Summer Despite all the fear, the case for the bull market’s continuation remains as strong as ever, with fundamentals and technicals lining up for a potentially stellar end to 2024, and extending well into 2025. The major indices are trading in strong long-term advancing trends, and following last year's major technical breakout, the benchmarks just had their first meaningful pullback, which is considered one of the best, lowest-risk entry points by trading pros. August’s deep pullback came and went so quickly that you might have missed it during your holiday trip. And even though some analysts, including one of Goldman Sachs’ (GS), believe that this is a warning sign for bulls, the Gorilla tends to disagree. Such quick recoveries are hallmarks of strong markets. While it's true that sentiment was a bit too bullish before the summer, many retail investors are waiting on the sidelines right now, providing ample future buying power. There is still plenty of skepticism about the bull market when it comes to professional investors as well, which is not how bear markets begin, as market tops and euphoria usually go hand in hand. In all likelihood, this summer’s pullback will only be a side note in the history of 2024, and the secular bull market will march on. But, if you don’t believe in the power of technicals and sentiment analysis, maybe the changing monetary conditions and the improving economic outlook will be enough to convince you that stocks should be near the top of your investment shortlist. The Fed’s New Focus: Jobs and Growth The Fed’s fight against inflation was long and painful for some sectors, with the real estate sector suffering the most, but overall, the economy and the stock market weathered the storm very well. That said, lower-income consumers were hit hard by surging prices and rising interest rates, which led to weaker growth in the consumer economy, but those trends have already reversed or are about to reverse. Real wages are rising, energy prices are near their war-era lows despite the sky-high tension in the Middle East, and inflation indicators have been surprising to the downside across the globe this summer. What’s more, inflation is now officially in the Fed’s rear-view mirror, and the past few months’ trends will likely give confidence to the Central Bank to be as aggressive in cutting interest rates as it was raising them. At the Fed’s Jackson Hole Symposium, which has a history of huge announcements, Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed that a rate cut is coming this month. Mr. Powell also stated that full employment is the Fed’s new focus, hinting at a brand-new monetary era, which will likely last for many years. Most experts now agree that going into the elections, the Fed will likely ease at least one more time. Yields hit one-year lows in August, with more cuts to follow in 2025. Furthermore, the ongoing tech revolution and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, in particular, will mean that long-term deflationary forces, such as increasing productivity and the impact of global trade will dominate again, leading to another extended period of low interest rates. Let’s see how the economy is doing ahead of the Fed’s easing cycle. Financials Are Breaking Out, Goldilocks Rally Ahead? Most seasoned investors would agree that one of the best ways to lose money on Wall Street is to go against the trends in the financial sector. The banking system’s strength is not only essential for growth, but the sector is usually a great forward-looking indicator of the economy and, in turn, the stock market. In fact, the bank sector’s stability in the face of last year’s regional bank crisis was among the Gorilla’s main reasons to expect a sustained breakout to new all-time highs from the major indices in 2024. So, what are financials up to these days, you might ask? Well, they are busy breaking out to new record highs. Focusing on this summer’s gloomy headlines, this might be quite the head-scratcher, but financials were among the first issues erasing August’s pullback. Why is that? Just in August, U.S. GDP growth was revised higher, retail sales blew away expectations, and the all-important services sector signaled accelerating growth, which is enough to make a feared recession highly unlikely anytime soon. Evidence for a “soft landing” is piling up and even though manufacturing is still struggling, the housing sector could start to contribute to GDP growth in a big way soon as demand remains strong, the financial system remains healthy, and mortgage rates are finally dropping. From a broader standpoint, the economic super-cycle that began following the COVID crisis and the shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine has the potential to last for many more years, and the technological leadership of the U.S., unique domestic market, solid demographic trends, and stable supply of resources provide a great fundamental backdrop for domestic stocks. With all the above in mind, the coming quarters could easily bring “Goldilocks” conditions for the market - solid growth coupled with easing monetary conditions - which usually means outstanding returns for stocks and other risk assets, but investors will have to keep adapting to the ever- changing market conditions. A Maturing Bull Market Before the start of 2024, the Gorilla expected a “slightly boring, frustrating, but bullish year.” By the end of August, even the worst-performing Dow was up nearly double-digits, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 sporting gains of over 15% each. These lofty gains - the product of the first quarter’s grinding and “boring” advance - might come as a surprise for investors who don’t closely follow the market, but such gains are normal in mature bull markets. Short-term traders likely experienced plenty of frustration, as volatility also followed the Gorilla’s expectations, with the Volatility Index (VIX) spending most of the year under the widely watched 20 level, outside of a few brief spikes. As before, all selloffs should be considered buying opportunities, but making a quick buck becomes more and more difficult in low-volatility markets. Small-caps surged to new multi-year highs after lagging the major indices last year, and even though the Russell 2000 is yet to take out its 2021 high, the broadening of the rally’s base is undeniable. The odds are that this year’s trends will continue well into next year, and the positive global developments mean that an accelerating rally could be in the cards following November’s elections, meaning that the current buying opportunity might not last long. This year’s increasing valuations make stock- picking even more important, and the Gorilla is ready to share his picks, which could thrive no matter the winning party! American Tower Corp. (AMT): The Ideal Interest Rate Play? If following Warren Buffet's investment principles is your goal, American Tower (AMT) checks at least one of the boxes; it's a simple business that is protected by a sizable moat and a stable client base. American Tower specializes in leasing real estate to telecommunication companies suited for a wide range of mobile, broadcast, and wireless applications across the globe, with its market capitalization climbing above $100 billion this year. The company was founded in 1995, and thanks to its three decades of experience and vast know-how, it is dominating its primary markets while having a competitive advantage throughout its secondary geographies. Through its comprehensive offerings, American Tower became one of the largest specialized REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) globally, giving it excellent bargaining power and comparatively low financing rates. The company has over 220K sites under its umbrella, spanning five continents and over 30 countries, with a clear focus on North and Latin America but a strong presence in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. Increasing global mobile penetration rates, surging data usage, the 5G rollout, and the looming generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom all but guarantee that the secular growth trend behind the company's growth won’t slow down anytime soon. Stable Income Streams, Global Exposure, And Relentless Growth AMT’s average lease agreement lasts nearly eight years, which, together with a very high client retention rate, leads to predictable and stable long- term income streams, with economic cycles barely affecting its core business. American Tower also enjoys very high renewal rates across its geographies, making it unique among REITs and a top pick to benefit from a sustained decline in interest rates. Its bargaining power and lean structure also place the company near the top of the industry’s profitability rankings, while presenting a strong barrier to entry to its potential competitors. American Tower has long implemented a strategy based on global growth, but over the past couple of years, it has refocused its capital allocation toward developed markets, and India, in particular, in a bid to reduce risk and further improve stability. This shift could improve execution, project success rate, and the spread between rental rates and financing costs. Since growth remains strong in the Americas and Europe, its growth impact will likely be negligible. That said, the bulk of the company's revenue relies on a specific niche, with some uncertainty regarding long-term demand, prompting a push to diversify while maintaining its competitive edge. Through the $10 billion acquisition of CoreSite, the company entered the data center business in 2021, complementing its core offerings, and American Tower now operates 25 sites, accounting for 7% of its total revenues in the second quarter of the year. This expansion aided growth while improving margins and providing exposure to a quickly growing market with deep synergies connected to the company’s core business. The new segment posted double-digit year-over-year growth in the latest quarter, and thanks to its AI exposure and substantial CAPEX spending, data center growth could even accelerate in the coming quarters. Financials and Valuation American Tower’s short-term performance is strongly tied to interest rate rates due to its financing and income structure, but digging down to its organic growth metrics shows steady growth and improving operational efficiency. The company's sales have been growing at a high-single-digit rate over the past five years, with operating expenses consistently surprising to the downside under new CEO Steven Vondara, and the company's crucial Funds From Operations (FFO) metric - essentially cash-flow for REITs - beating expectations. American Tower recently upgraded its bottom-line projections for the next couple of years, forecasting a growth rate of over 6%, with analysts predicting earnings growth to top 25% per year through 2029. The company’s growth strategy utilizes leverage, hence its strongly rate- sensitive nature, Despite its debt-based business model, the company's balance sheet is also stable, with a declining net leverage ratio. Since American Tower uses a Consumer Price Index (CPI) -based re-pricing clauses in its contracts, its revenue has also been tracking the past couple of years’ surge in inflation, and contract resets will continue to increase cash-flow in the coming years. The company is paying a respectable and stable dividend of roughly 3%, but American Tower still boasts stable Free-Cash-Flows (FCF) generation, which easily covers its dividend and provides the base for further growth. American Tower’s valuation remains attractive despite this year's gains, and an aggressive rate-cut cycle from the Fed could see the company’s valuation metrics plummet, making its current price a substantial bargain. With the entire real estate sector currently “underinvested” due to its recent struggles, retail investors could provide additional buying power once the recovery gains steam, which could lead to a multi-year rally. The potential downside should there be a rebound in inflation, is limited at its current level. Hence, the stock offers a low risk/reward ratio for investors, with the company’s substantial backlog and the recent surge in rental demand, assuring healthy top-line growth. Technicals and Recent Performance AMT staged a turnaround this year following a grueling three-year period, and since the company’s fundamentals have been steadily improving over the past several years, the stock might have plenty of gas left in the tank. AMT is now trading in a well-established long-term bullish trend, well above its 200-day moving average, and after breaking out above the $235 level, bulls could, in the medium-term, have their sights on the stock’s all-time high from 2021. The stock recently formed a classic cup-and-handle pattern, confirming its trend reversal, which could provide technical tailwinds for the rest of the year. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM): A New Dawn for the IT Giant? Despite its pivotal role in establishing the modern tech industry, IBM has been dismissed as a perpetual laggard for over a decade, and for a good reason. Even though the company tried to reinvent itself multiple times, its bloated organizational structure, surging costs, sluggish growth, and low margins made it a tough choice as an investment. Over the past five years, IBM went through a real transformation under CEO Arvind Krishna, spinning off a significant portion of its low-margin legacy IT infrastructure business into Kyndryl Holdings (KD) to entirely focus on its hybrid-cloud-based software and consulting business. Since the spinoff, IBM has managed to enter a phase of organic growth. Although IBM hasn't solved all of its issues, the company’s recent track record in execution, cost management, and strategic decisions make it an attractive and cheap option in the tech space. The company's quickly improving financials, combined with its massive knowledge base and research and development prowess, give its shares significant upside potential. What's more, IBM’s growth has been greatly aided by its business-to-business (B2B) AI offerings, which could be one of the catalysts of the company's developing turnaround story. Software and Consulting Surge Fueled by Generative AI Adoption Why is IBM, of all companies, such a promising low-risk AI play? Well, IBM primarily serves business customers across multiple industries, providing essential productivity, communication, and analytics tools. One of generative AI’s most relevant use cases, at its current level, is customized “in-house” productivity solutions, which align perfectly with IBM’s expertise, especially given the company’s “hands-on” approach to its projects, which manifests in close long-term collaborations with its clients. The company recognized this synergy and was quick to implement a wide range of AI-driven software solutions, such as customized assistants, knowledge bases, and data-analytic tools, which were met by strong demand over the past couple of years. IBM’s strategic focus on its software and consulting segments resulted in steady top and bottom-line growth over the past years, and analysts expect continued mid-single-digit expansion in both areas. The company’s hybrid cloud platforms have been driving growth in its software segment, but AI adoption also led to an uptick in infrastructure revenues through an accelerated upgrade cycle. IBM’s latest software partnerships on cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and AI data solutions with industry leaders such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS have increased its reach, and its stable B2B client base provides a great foundation for further cloud growth. IBM has been active on the acquisition front this year, making use of its improving financial position, and the market reacted well to the company's growth push, with its $6.4 billion HashiCorp deal making the biggest waves. The cloud automation company’s offerings fit well into IBM’s strategic vision, and its quick integration into the company's platforms shows that IBM is a different, more agile beast that can maintain its momentum. That said, IBM is still a laggard in the eyes of a slew of players in the industry, and the company has plenty of room to improve its brand, but IBM's new management seems to be on the right path. Financials and Valuation IBM's margins have been improving across the board since 2019, with the company's revenue hitting a five-year high over the past twelve months, with its operational costs flat over the same period. Since 2020, IBM’s operational costs are down by roughly 10%, which might not seem much, but given the size of IBM’s operations and the 100% increase in comparable sales, its margin impact is massive, and the company’s further cost-saving initiatives could lead to rapid improvements in the coming quarters. IBM’s latest quarters have been consistently stronger than analyst expectations, with its free cash flow of over $13 billion, in particular, turning heads, which vastly improved the company's financial position. IBM’s debt load of $53 billion remains higher-than-average compared to its competitors, but thanks to its improving profitability and steady growth, the company is unlikely to face financing issues, especially during the Fed’s easing cycle. In fact, IBM is now in a position to significantly reduce its debt burden or refinance it at lower rates in the coming years, with the company having enough resources to continue investing in growth while returning capital to investors. IBM offers a dividend yieldof 3% at its current price level, which will become more and more attractive as the Fed cuts interest rates in the coming quarters. Even though the consensus regarding IBM’s business is starting to shift, its stock still trades at a hefty discount compared to its peers, both based on current and future earnings, giving it massive upside potential for years to come. Technicals and Recent Performance IBM has been showing relative strength compared to the large-cap benchmarks and its closest peers since the summer of 2023, and the stock is currently “testing” the $200 level after hitting decade-long highs earlier this year. Currently, IBM offers a unique blend of low volatility and outperformance that could provide stability and above-average returns for years to come, with plenty of headroom once the stock clears its all-time high from 2013. IBM is trading in a strong bullish trend, above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and while up by over 20% on a year-to-date basis, the stock could enjoy technical tailwinds throughout the rest of the year, should it complete its technical breakout above $200. Spotify(SPOT): The Next Billion-User Tech Giant? Spotify is the undoubted global leader in the audio streaming market, controlling roughly one-third of the quickly growing segment. Spotify has over 625 million active users, up from 77 million in 2015 and 232 million in 2019, with the company registering continuous growth thanks to its dual freemium model, based on an ad-supported free tier and ad-free premium tiers. Spotify also boasts nearly 250 million paying subscribers. With the secular shift toward streaming in music consumption still in full swing, the company’s mid-term goal of reaching 1 billion users seems realistic. The company’s mobile app remains one of the fastest-growing apps globally, with the company having a strong presence in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The Swedish company’s biggest market is still the U.S., despite strong competition from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN), but its other geographies have been growing quicker than its established markets in recent years, transforming Spotify into a truly global powerhouse in audio streaming space. Spotify is often referred to as the Netflix (NFLX) of music, and for a good reason, as the company's audio offerings are comparable to Netflix’s video products, with a few caveats, which analogy will be crucial in understanding the company's huge potential and the strategic challenges it faces. Product and Pricing Innovation Fueling Growth Amid Owned -Content Push For nearly a decade, Netflix faced scrutiny over the viability of its business model due to its high royalty costs, expensive content strategy, and stiff competition across its key markets. However, the video streaming company showed that such a model could be successful in the long run with a strong brand, global presence, and aggressive growth strategy. That said, Spotify and other audio services generally pay higher royalty fees, and audio streaming services products tend to be more comprehensive but more homogeneous than video services, with less exclusive content. In theory, this makes switching between services less costly for customers, but Spotify has a few aces up its sleeve that have been helping it with these strategic weaknesses. Spotify, thanks to its high engagement levels, has a huge competitive advantage compared to its closest peers and even Netflix; according to research firm, Antenna, of all video and audio streaming services, Spotify’s customers are the least likely to cancel their subscriptions in the U.S. with a monthly cancellation rate of less than 2%. This explains that, despite the fierce competition, Spotify’s U.S. market share has steadily increased over the past three years, capturing market shares from big guns like Apple and Amazon, a feat deemed unlikely by many analysts. Spotify continues to be laser-focused on growing its user base of its core business globally while expanding its offerings and increasing the share of its owned-content portfolio. The company recently started offering audiobooks with promising initial results, with paid podcasts also being an important part of Spotify’s diversification push. These new products could broaden the company’s demographic reach beyond its traditional young adult audience, Spotify is offering its new products both individually and in bundles - which are being rolled out across its geographies - and the company’s bundling strategy could significantly boost its margins in the long run. Financials and Valuation Spotify proved its pricing power and user retention capability over the past couple of years amid a global surge in inflation, raising its prices two times in some regions, with its average price now above its major peers’ fees, such as Apple Music, in the U.S. Paying subscriber growth has been very strong in recent quarters, with its paid segment outperforming its ad-supported segment, despite its price hikes, and the company’s increasing global footprint means that its growth potential continues to be exceptional. Paid subscriptions comprise over 85% of Spotify’s total revenue, and should its owned-content strategy pan out, the path to becoming a “cash cow” would be clear, especially given the company's low churn rates. When it comes to evaluating Spotify’s financials, profitability is the elephant in the room, with some analysts doubting the company's ability to turn a sustained profit, as effectively monetizing its quickly growing user base could prove tricky. Furthermore, royalties make up the vast majority of the company’s costs, and since the royalty-holding studios are in a strong bargaining position, Spotify could face long-term margin pressures. At the same time, Spotify’s optimized subscriber plans and new monetization avenues have already boosted its profitability measures, leading to a surge in its share price. Spotify’s revenue neared $16 billion over the past twelve months, with its quarterly revenue growing by 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite the headwinds in the consumer sector. The company executed a significant cost- cutting program following its COVID-era boom, and its gross margin climbed back to nearly 30% in the second quarter of 2024, after dropping below 25% in 2022. Thanks to the past couple of years’ positive developments, the company’s financial position has improved significantly, with its FCF reaching $490 million and its cash hoard topping $5 billion in the second quarter of this year, which eclipses its total debt of $2 billion. Based on its current earnings, Spotify’s valuation is sky-high. Still, its recent momentum and its lofty long- term profit potential could easily justify its market cap of $60 billion, even considering substantial execution- and competition-related risks. Technicals and Recent Performance SPOT has been on a tear ever since the start of 2023, coinciding with the company’s cost-cutting push, and the stock is still trading in an explosive bullish trend. Despite its lofty year-to-date gains, the stock is only now nearing its all-time high from 2021, and a technical breakout could open a brand new chapter for SPOT in the coming months. As the company’s business continues to mature, the stock’s sky-high volatility is bound to decline, but SPOT is the riskiest of the Gorilla’s picks while having the most upside potential as well. Tradewed Markets(TW): Exceptional Growth in a Unique Market Even though Tradeweb (TW) is a lesser-known company, it has definitely made its mark in the institutional bond trading space, exploding into the scene with unique and modern solutions aiming to bring the market into the 21st century. Government bond and credit markets are still stuck in the past in a sense, with traditional deal-making methods holding up in the face of the retail trading markets' rapid electronification. That said, the secular trend of modernization is clear, and Tradeweb is in a prime position to benefit from it in the coming decade, which has been the company’s strategic focus since well before going public in 2019. Despite fierce competition in its markets, Tradeweb has been executing its growth-focused strategy - expanding into new products and geographies while increasing its market share - without hiccups. The company’s platform- based strategy makes it easy to expand into new product segments, and currently, Tradeweb is already offering trading, processing, and data services for over 50 products, making it the go-to provider for a slew of institutional investors. The company navigated the past couple of years’ bond turmoil in an exemplary fashion, sticking to its strategic plans and using the market’s weakness for “bolt-on” acquisitions, such as By now, Tradeweb provides services for over 2,500 clients primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia, including the vast majority of the top global asset managers and their clients, with its market share nearing 20% in its main electronic markets., and its reach is still growing in the professional space. Connecting Markets and Providing Synergies for A Wide Range of Clients Tradewed defines itself as an “operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities, and money markets,” which, in layman's terms, places it somewhere between an exchange and a brokerage, with the company serving institutional, wholesale, retail, and corporate clients. Tradeweb’s average daily trading volume was above $1.8 trillion in the second quarter, with double-digit growth across its U.S. credit, European credit, municipal growth, credit derivatives, and money markets offerings. Even though growth rates, such as Tradeweb’s, often lead to organizational issues and mismanagement of resources, the company’s growth is largely based on providing products previously unconnected to existing clients. For example, Tradeweb recently became the first electronic trading platform to connect repo (short-term borrowing for bond dealers) and IRS (interest rate swap) markets while expanding its data services based on real-world needs. Thanks to its product expansion, the company’s addressable market has been growing by over 10% over the past five years, but its sales are up by an annualized 20% in the same period, highlighting its increased market share and organic growth potential. The company's latest acquisitions reflect its client-first approach and its goal to target new clients. Earlier this year, Tradeweb bought Institutional Cash Distributors, an investment technology provider focusing on corporate clients trading short-term Treasury-related investments, for $785 million to open a whole new client channel leveraging its existing infrastructure. Last year, through its acquisition of r8fin, Tradeweb dipped its toes into algorithmic trading while entering the Australian and New Zealand fixed- income markets via the $80 million Yieldbroker deal. Financials and Valuation Tradeweb aims to be a disruptor in its business while maintaining a lean corporate structure, which is no easy feat, but the company's low cost and debt levels suggest that it has efficiently dealt with its double-digit growth rate. Looking at its last quarter, its revenue and earnings were up by 30% and 35%, respectively, with Tradeweb’s profits topping $400 million while its sales surpassing $1.5 billion over the past twelve months. The company’s revenue roughly doubled since 2021, with its earnings growing even more. Tradeweb’s rates and credit segments provide the bulk, roughly two-thirds of its sales. However, its money market and market data businesses are also increasing organically and through its acquisitions. Despite its stellar growth and the seasonal nature of its business, the company’s financials have been steady, with Tradeweb successfully harnessing economies of scale while integrating its acquisitions. Looking at just its current P/E ratio of over 50, Tradeweb might seem expensive, but the company’s growth outlook is unparalleled in its industry, with the consensus calling for a yearly earning growth rate north of 15% for the next five years. Tradeweb has over $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, providing ample liquidity and funds for further expansion, and the company has been returning capital to investors ever since its IPO, both through dividends and stock repurchases. TW is operating with very low debt, and although growth always has its risks, the stock’s valuations seem reasonable, and its relatively low institutional ownership suggests that demand for its shares could remain strong for years to come, especially since TW is not yet part of any major index. Technicals and Recent Performance Tradeweb’s great execution is reflected in its shares’ performance and the company’s valuation, with TW being up nearly 300% since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 while also registering a gain of over 100% since its 2022 trough. TW hit a new all-time high in February, eclipsing its COVID-era spike, and after consolidating its technical breakout, the stock continued its march to new highs during the summer. TW is trading in a bullish long-term trend, with plenty of technical “support” below, and given the company's expansion, this year's breakout could be the start of a multi-year bull run, while easing financial conditions could provide additional tailwinds for the stock. Uber(UBER): Global Innovation and Growth Powerhouse Uber is the leader in the global app-based ride-hailing market, both in the U.S. and globally, while being a major player in food and grocery delivery as well through its Uber Eats brand. Uber’s core business is sporting a monthly active user base of 150 million, with the company’s ever-growing platform boasting a global user pool of well over 500 million. Uber emerged as a poster child of the “new economy” over the past decade, despite its controversies, emerging from the “unicorn” status as a sustainably profitable but still growth-focused tech company. Throughout its 15-year history, the company has had its fair share of legal scrutiny, but Uber has been successfully navigating the legal minefield, always maintaining its focus on relentless growth. Uber carved out significant market shares in multiple markets and geographies, taking full advantage of its platform, with innovative pricing models and aggressive cost management strategies aiding its expansion, and Uber’s revenues crossed $40 billion for the first time over the past twelve months, with its market capitalization breaching $150 billion. The Gorilla believes that Uber's growth story is far from over, and as an investment, it entered a new phase of its life cycle this year, as the company reached stable profitability while maintaining its growth potential. Uber might now be ready to join the “big guns” of the tech sector. Although Uber’s markets aren't considered highly interest-rate- sensitive, the company's stock has been showing as strong a correlation with yields as the real estate and utilities sectors over the past few years. With all that in mind, Uber is in a unique position to benefit from the Fed’s easing cycle, while transitioning from a low-margin growth powerhouse to a more mature but still agile tech giant. Network Effects Drive Strategic Strength Even though Uber faces stiff competition in its core markets while eyeing already competitive new opportunities, its personalized, flexible, and dynamic pricing practices give it a clear edge over its traditional competitors, with its closest peers also being forced to adapt to the company’s strategies. Uber has a history of executing bold expansion strategies, with a clear focus on achieving dominance in its markets to harvest network effects and platform synergies. Be it its ride-hailing or delivery segments, Uber managed to disrupt established markets, and with 85% of its major markets being already profitable and its margins improving in the vast majority of its geographies, it’s hard to question its strategic vision. Uber One, the company’s membership program, is a great example of its focus on aggressive growth, and the fact that in just over two years, the service reached a 50% share of gross delivery bookings underlines the company’s great execution. Uber One has already contributed to consumer retention, gross booking growth, and cross-selling across its segments while maintaining its competitive advantage and pricing strength and providing an easy path to enter new niches. Uber’s platform allows the company to rapidly deploy and test new offerings at a low cost while offering its strategic partners easy access to a massive pool of potential clients, which could remain a strong growth driver. According to a slew of analysts, autonomous vehicles or robotaxis are considered a major threat to Uber’s ride-hailing business in the long run. However, given its market penetration, strategic advantages, and platform strength, the company might even benefit from the technological shift. Uber is well aware of the looming revolution and, through expanding its portfolio and forming strategic partnerships, such as its Waymo deal, the company is actively managing the robotaxi risk, which likely won’t impact its business in a meaningful way until at least the 2030s. Financials and Valuation In its early years, profitability was Uber’s achilles heel, but since 2018, the company’s revenue is up by a whopping 300%, and doubts about the company’s ability to turn sustained profits diminished in recent years. Uber not only delivered consistent growth despite the challenges of the past five years, but it also outperformed its peers both in the U.S. and globally. Year- over-year booking and revenue growth were roughly 20% and 15%, respectively, in the second quarter, despite a slowdown in the consumer economy, with its Mobility and Delivery segments fueling growth. Even though its shift toward subscription-based pricing led to a slight drop in delivery margins, the company continues to lead the market in profitability while keeping up with its main competitor, DoorDash, in pure growth metrics. Uber has also been expanding its offerings while improving network density and expanding into retail fulfillment, and the segment now accounts for 50% of its bookings. The company’s strong brand recognition and increased offerings helped maintain the inflow of new customers, which has been one of the main catalysts behind UBER’s strong performance over the past couple of years. Although the company’s debt load is still substantial, Uber’s swift expansion, improving margins, and other profitability metrics led to a sharp drop in its financing costs, which, together with the global rate-cut cycle, is expected to have an outsized effect on the growth-focused company’s bottom line and its balance sheet. This positive shift is yet to be fully priced in by the market, and even though its current valuation is rich from a simple P/E perspective, its post-COVID growth rate and its financing costs -which allow for further expansion - make its shares fundamentally attractive here. Technicals and Recent Performance Since its IPO in 2019, UBER had multiple volatile swings, with the twin crises of the past four years leading to quite the roller-coaster ride for its investors. That said, 2023 saw a clear shift in the stock’s market value, with the company’s surging profitability fueling a bullish trend and an eventual breakout to new all-time highs. UBER’s relative strength compared to its closest peers suggests that this technical breakout was just the start of a multi-year bull run, and its exceptional growth potential could finally translate to great sustained returns for its investors. UBER is in a great position to ride the next wave higher in the bull market, and its 2021 high provides ample technical support, meaning that the stock is at a low-risk- high-reward entry point. Conclusion Even though the media always likes to paint a picture of an imminent crisis to grab people's attention, the “boring” truth is that we are in a secular bull market with plenty of room to run following a hectic start to the 2020s. Investors, understandably so, remain cautious and exit their positions at the first sign of trouble, which explains August’s historic surge in volatility - one of the Volatility Index’s (VIX) most violent ones in its 30-year history - which lasted for a mere three days. Folks, bull markets generally last way longer than anyone dares to predict, so it’s important to keep your eyes on the target: increasing your capital by investing in strong businesses. The current bull easily survived the recent surge in inflation, the Fed’s painful cure, the escalation in the Middle East, and the rising tensions between the West and the Global South, and there is still no crisis in sight that could derail the secular trend. This means that violent pullbacks such as the one we experienced this past August, however scary they are, should be viewed as buying opportunities, as they usually set the stage for the next swing higher. That said, we are entering a new phase of the bull market, with easing monetary conditions and a transition to a maturing economic cycle. Like at the start of the inflationary crisis and near the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle, a new crop of stocks will have an advantage over the prior leaders due to the changing financing and economic backdrop. Taking advantage of this “rotation” could be the key to beating the market and elevating your investments to the next level. This doesn't mean that you should completely overhaul your portfolio, in fact, sticking to your guns during bull markets usually pays off, but changing conditions will lead to new opportunities. That's where the Gorilla’s hand- picked picks come in, offering different levels of risk and upside potential. Early- and late-stage disruptors, a dominant real estate giant, and a potential turnaround star give you plenty of options, with all companies being well- positioned to benefit from the ongoing macroeconomic and monetary shifts moving toward the elections. With fundamentals and technicals looking bullish again following a frustrating summer, these stocks could greatly boost to your portfolio!

More Info Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. Last weekend, we warned readers that according to the latest data from Goldman Sachs, a massive short squeeze in energy stocks was on deck. Specifically we noted that at a time when funds were the most short oil on record, the broader energy space "was the most net sold sector" on the Goldman US Prime book, "driven entirely by short sales, which outpaced long buys (6.4 to 1)." And here, we said, was "the hint to the next mega squeeze" as the recent short selling in energy was the largest in over 5 years. What happened next was for the history books, as Brent crude soared the most in almost two years on the back of what was a historic market imbalance with record shorts suddenly starting to run for cover... ... with the Kamala lackeys at Bloomberg going so far as to mock those who actually did the right thing and trade ahead of the inevitable squeeze as "tourists", when in reality the only tourists here are those who expected the ridiculous plunge in oil prices to persist despite Cushing approaching tank bottoms (Bloomberg's message is loud and clear: keep shorting oil unless you want to be branded a "tourist", especially since a spike in oil - and gas - prices may adversely impact its favorite presidential candidate). Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the squeeze in energy is just getting started, and not just due to fundamentals. Crude oil soared last week as a result of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the middle east. On Tuesday, spot month WTI and Brent rallied >5% from the lows on the initial headlines from the White House that an Iranian attack was imminent. Goldman's research desk noted on Tuesday that the jump in oil prices reflected a moderate risk premium as actual production disruptions have been limited and spare capacity remains elevated. The energy complex jumped again Thursday on news that the US was considering whether or not to support Israel’s potential retaliatory attacks against Iranian energy infrastructure. Then, over the weekend, the bank's commodity analysts published a new report (available to pro subs) in which they tried to calculate the impact on the price of oil should Iran oil output be "limited" by Israel, to wit: But it's not just fundamentals: Goldman's Prime Brokerage wrote in its latest weekly must-read note (also available to pro subs) that "after heightened geopolitical tensions and rising crude oil price, HFs reversed course and net bought US Energy stocks for the first time in 7 weeks, driven almost entirely by short covers." As a result, the US Energy long/short ratio increased +5% – the largest weekly increase in nearly 5 months – to 1.36, which is in the 69th percentile vs. the past year and 14th percentile vs. the past five years." That said, the short overhang in energy remains staggering, and hints at a far more brutal unwind once the upward momentum persists for another week, and not only in energy stocks where the short flow on Goldman's Prime Broekrage is just shy of record highs... ... but also in the oil patch, because after oil short interest hit a record two weeks ago as traders turned the most bearish on oil they have ever been, the amount of short covering was virtually non existent, and net managed-money (i.e., hedge fund) exposure across the 4 main oil contracts (Nymex and ICE WTI, Nymex and ICE Brent), is barely above its record lows! Putting it all together, Goldman Energy specialist Ryan Novak writes that "energy led to the upside on the week after we exited the prior week with aggressive PB selling/short selling that flipped this week, managed money positioning remains short - at all-time lows and tensions across the Middle East escalating with Israel beginning its ground invasion. E&Ps led on the week +7%. All eyes on any incremental news regarding any attack on Iranian energy infrastructure which would pose further upside risk to the commodity and equities." Bottom line: with record shorts now painfully squeezed as upward momentum has been ignited across the energy sector, and the risk of a flashing red headline that Israel has leveled Kharg Island looming, unwind of what until a week ago was a record short position in oil and energy stocks is just getting started. And that's without Israel even doing anything. Should Israel however take the plunge and either take out Iran's oil infrastructure or, worse, target its nuclear industry, then the coming explosion in oil will make the Volkswagen short squeeze of 2008 seem like quaint amateur hour.

October 07, 2024 06:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 2Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (3Q23-2Q24), webscalers represented $2.47 trillion (T) in revenues (+8.2% YoY), $301 billion (B) in R&D spending (+5.4% YoY), and $226B in capex (+15.4% YoY). They had $612B of cash and short-term investments (-8.5% YoY) on the books as of June 2024, and $527B in total debt (-3.6% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of June 2024 was $787B, up 19.8% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.182 million (M) people at the end of 2Q24, up a bit from the June 2023 total of 4.085M. Below are key highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 2Q24 were $614.4 billion (B), up 8.4% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.466 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For four straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 2Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 24.3% versus 3Q22-2Q23, followed by Microsoft (+15.7%), Alphabet (13.4%), and Amazon (12.3%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 2Q24 came from Amazon, as its revenues grew $13.6 billion from 2Q23 to end 2Q24 at $148B, up 10.1% YoY. The biggest curb on growth was Chinese ecommerce player JD.com, which recorded 2Q24 revenues of $40.2B, down $0.8B YoY (-2.0%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has been on a tear for the first two quarters of 2024, growing 25% and 51% in 1Q24 and 2Q24 respectively. That pushed 2Q24 annualized capex to $226.4 billion in 2Q24, an all-time high and up 15.4% YoY. Webscalers continue with big land purchases and long-term efforts to develop all-new data center campuses. However, the surge appears to be driven largely by technology spending, in particular purchases of servers (GPU and CPU) for data center facilities already up and running. From 44% of annualized capex in 2Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 54% of total capex for the last two quarters. The biggest capex outlays in 2Q24 came from Amazon ($17.6B), Microsoft ($13.9B), Alphabet ($13.2B), and Meta (FB) ($8.2B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 18.6% for the 2Q24 annualized period, much higher than the 16.3% and 14.4% recorded in the annualized 2Q23 and 2Q22 timeframes. Average net profit margins are also strong, totaling 18.8% for the overall market in 2Q24 annualized, from 15.2% in 2Q23 and 16.3% in 2Q22. Meta (FB) and Microsoft have the highest overall margins across these two categories. Amazon is a perpetual drag on margins despite its size. Alibaba and Alphabet both reported FCF figures substantially lower than 2Q23, impacting the market average negatively. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.18 million in June 2024, slightly up from 4.08 million in June 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Webscale employment is unlikely to rise much from here, if at all. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 2Q24 revenue growth was 3% YoY, after a 2% increase in 1Q24. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. One factor is TikTok's owner, ByteDance: this private company has exploded in the last 3 years, impacting negatively the measured growth of the publicly traded Chinese webscalers that we do track (Alibaba, Baidu, JD, and Tencent). The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB), a space systems company, has been selected by NASA to conduct a study for the Mars Sample Return Program, aiming to bring Martian rock samples back to Earth. This mission, if realized, would mark the first time in history that materials from Mars are retrieved for analysis, potentially advancing our understanding of the planet and the possibility of past life on its surface. The study is part of NASA's Rapid Mission Design Studies for Mars Sample Return, which seeks proposals for mission designs that can transport samples collected by the Mars Perseverance rover back to Earth. Rocket Lab's proposal suggests a simplified, cost-effective mission concept that could be executed significantly earlier and at a lower cost than the current projected sample return date in 2040. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck emphasized the company's track record in delivering cost-efficient planetary science missions. Beck stated, "We've developed an innovative mission concept to make it happen affordably and on an accelerated schedule." He highlighted Rocket Lab's experience, including delivering missions to the Moon, enabling orbital rendezvous, re-entering capsules from orbit, and contributing to NASA's Mars missions. The specifics of Rocket Lab's proposed mission architecture will be disclosed upon completion of the study in the upcoming months. Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is recognized for its launch services, satellite manufacturing, spacecraft components, and on-orbit management solutions. The company has successfully launched 197 satellites to orbit since its first orbital launch in January 2018 and is currently developing a larger launch vehicle, Neutron, for constellation deployment. This press release contains forward-looking statements, and the final outcome of the study and any subsequent missions will depend on various factors, including technological developments and budgetary considerations. The information in this article is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, aerospace company Rocket Lab USA has been the subject of significant developments. KeyBanc analyst has increased the price target for Rocket Lab shares to $11.00 from the previous $8.00, maintaining an Overweight rating. This adjustment follows a roadshow with the company's CFO, Adam Spice, and reflects confidence in Rocket Lab's potential to expand its operations and its continued growth trajectory. Rocket Lab reported a substantial increase in Q2 revenue, hitting $106 million, primarily due to the success of its Electron rocket. However, Q3 revenue is projected to decrease slightly, estimated between $100 million and $105 million. The company also completed testing and integration of its second Pioneer spacecraft for Varda Space Industries, Inc., marking a significant advancement in in-space manufacturing and logistics. Rocket Lab also announced key personnel changes, appointing Frank Klein as its new Chief Operations Officer and adding Kenneth Possenriede, a former Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) executive, to its Board of Directors. The company is set for its 53rd Electron mission, 'Kinéis Killed the RadIOT Star,' aimed at enhancing global Internet of Things connectivity. Rocket Lab has shipped two spacecraft, Blue and Gold, for NASA's Mars mission, as part of the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) project. These are recent developments in Rocket Lab's journey in the aerospace industry. Rocket Lab's selection for NASA's Mars Sample Return Program study aligns with the company's strong growth trajectory. According to InvestingPro data, Rocket Lab has demonstrated impressive revenue growth, with a 40.95% increase in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and a notable 71.25% quarterly revenue growth in Q2 2024. This growth trend supports the company's ability to take on ambitious projects like the Mars mission study. InvestingPro Tips highlight that analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year, which could be further bolstered by high-profile projects such as the NASA study. Additionally, the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility to invest in innovative mission concepts. Despite these positive indicators, it's worth noting that Rocket Lab is not currently profitable, with a negative operating income margin of -52.99% in the last twelve months. However, the company's strong market position and growth potential are reflected in its high revenue valuation multiple. For investors interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Rocket Lab, providing a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and market position.

Investors have until October 7, 2024 to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors in Ford securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and is captioned Guzman v. Ford Motor Company, et al., No. 24-cv-12080. What is the Lawsuit About? Ford is an automotive manufacturing company that develops, delivers, and services a range of trucks, cars, and luxury vehicles worldwide. The complaint alleges that during the relevant period, the company misrepresented its warranty reserves and that it had completed a sequence of organizational changes designed to ensure higher quality and lower costs. In truth, Ford was experiencing higher warranty costs, and the warranty reserves did not accurately reflect the quality issues in its vehicles. On July 24, 2024, after the market closed, Ford announced second quarter 2024 financial results (the “2Q24 Press Release”).

This news caused the price of Ford’s stock to decline by $2.51 per share, or over 18%, to close at $11.16 per share on July 25, 2024.Click here if you suffered losses: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/ford-motor-company.

Good morning. On this day 22 years ago, a company named Palm introduced a mobile device called Zire, a $99 attempt to woo regular people—consumers—into using handheld computers, then called personal digital assistants. Two decades later, handheld computers are ubiquitous, and personal assistants are, shall we say, a bit more AI-flavored than they used to be. But $99? Friend, those days are long gone. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. There is not a video game company on earth that hasn’t had a tough time of it in the last two years as the passage of time eroded pandemic gains. But Ubisoft has had it tougher than most. The market value of the French maker of Assassin’s Creed has been steadily declining since it peaked in 2021. At Ubisoft’s height, you needed the equivalent of $20 to purchase a share on the Paris stock exchange; lately, you needed just $2. Ouch. So it comes as no surprise that Tencent and Ubisoft’s founding Guillemot family, which both retain minority stakes in the game publisher, are reportedly exploring taking the company private as it approaches its 39th birthday. (Ubisoft’s CEO is Yves Guillemot.) Its share price jumped more than 30% on the news. A push to go private may shield the company from investors trying to dismantle it, but it won’t rectify its challenges elsewhere. Sales of first-person shooter XDefiant underwhelmed, as did Star Wars Outlaws. Meanwhile, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been pushed to 2025 and the company’s workers in France are on the cusp of a strike. Remember, Yves: The world is an illusion. One you can either submit to, as most do, or transcend. —AN The company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has unveiled a new tool that will let people create short video clips by merely entering simple text prompts describing what they want to see and hear. Don’t count on using Meta’s new Movie Gen to become the next Steven Spielberg anytime soon, however—it’s not yet publicly available. And the clips the tool produces are limited to just 16 seconds. In announcing the service, Meta is joining a race that promises to revolutionize filmmaking. Upstarts Runway and Pika already offer similar tools, while OpenAI has developed one that is available only to a small number of users. Critics fear this new wave of AI for video creation risks being misused to spread disinformation. What is clear, though, is that Hollywood stands to both benefit from using AI to create new films and face challenges if anyone in their bedroom can do the same. —Jason Del Rey The Lone Star State has sued TikTok for allegedly misusing the data of its young users, adding to the social media company’s long list of legal woes in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed Thursday, accuses TikTok of violating a new Texas law banning social media companies from selling or sharing a minor’s data without an adult’s approval. The service is also accused of failing to add tools that let parents see how their children use social media; the current version works only if minors consent to being monitored. TikTok denied the allegations, telling the Texas Tribune that it complies with data-sharing laws and that parents can request that their kids’ accounts be deleted. Texas isn’t the only U.S. state to take TikTok to court. Utah, Nebraska, Indiana, and Arkansas have also sued the company, which is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, over alleged privacy and safety violations involving children. Of course, all of this may soon be moot. TikTok, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, is fighting for its life against the federal government’s order earlier this year that the service be sold or shut down. The clock ticks until mid-January. —Jenn Brice Over the years, major tech companies have come to define the idea of the “open web” to their own benefit—often to the disadvantage of their users. Google is the latest example of such tortured redefinition. New proposed legislation in New Zealand will force the U.S. company to compensate the news publishers that provide a significant portion of the content for its massively profitable search engine (not to mention training data for its generative AI models). Google’s response: Fine, we’ll just stop linking to news articles in our products. The company’s argument for removing the ability for New Zealand’s 5 million residents to access news articles through its popular search engine and other services is that remunerating publishers for using their content is “in conflict with the principles of the open web.” It would also harm small publishers and create unlimited financial exposure for the company, whose parent Alphabet generated $307 billion of revenue in its last full fiscal year. In recent years Australia and Canada have passed laws aimed at forcing Google and rival Meta to pay for news content that appears on their platforms. In Australia, the tech giants entered deals worth many millions; in Canada, they stopped linking to news. How distant a memory is the open web in New Zealand? We’ll soon find out. —Kali Hays Max Schrems strikes again! The Austrian-activist-turned-Meta-arch-nemesis has scored a ruling from the EU’s highest court, saying Meta and other online ad players can’t just use every morsel of someone’s personal data to target ads at them, forever. That’s because the “data minimization” principle in the General Data Protection Regulation says Facebook has to limit how long it can exploit a user’s data and the types of data that can be used for ad targeting. Schrems has been dragging Meta through the EU courts for a dozen years, leaving the wreckage of multiple EU-U.S. data-sharing agreements and forcing the Facebook owner to ask for users’ consent before targeting ads at them. He told me he was “happy to have gotten a clear ruling that Meta and other online advertisers have to minimize the use of personal data for ads.” —David Meyer —Apple Intelligence will arrive Oct. 28. Gird your iPhones. —“Salt Typhoon” cyberattack affects U.S. telcos. It links to the Chinese government. —Can you revamp Facebook for Gen Z? Meta is sure trying.

Title: Barclays sees Netflix shares out of sync with growth prospects, downgrades to underweight

Time Published: 2024-10-07T09:45:17Z
Full Content:
On Monday, Barclays downgraded shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the streaming giant listed on NASDAQ: NFLX, from Equalweight to Underweight, while setting a price target of $550. The firm cited concerns over the company's growth prospects and valuation as reasons for the downgrade. The analyst from Barclays acknowledged Netflix's exceptional execution through various business model shifts and changes in the industry structure, highlighting the company's success in building the largest content and content distribution business worldwide. Netflix has been recognized as a major winner in the entertainment shift toward streaming and stands as the leading incumbent in the space. Despite these achievements, the analyst pointed out that over the past two to three years, Netflix has increasingly relied on new growth drivers, such as paid sharing, to sustain double-digit revenue growth. These strategies, however, may be accelerating future growth prematurely. Growth is reportedly slowing, and each new lever that Netflix pulls comes with trade-offs. Moreover, the analyst noted that Netflix has benefited from margin expansion being pulled forward, which may have created unrealistic expectations for the company's long-term margins and free cash flow (FCF). In light of these considerations, the firm believes that Netflix's current valuation does not align with its probable growth trajectory. Barclays' new price target reflects a more cautious outlook on Netflix's ability to maintain its growth pace in the face of evolving market dynamics and increased competition in the streaming industry. The report from Barclays suggests that investors may need to recalibrate their expectations for the company's performance moving forward. In other recent news, the Philippines has imposed a 12% value-added tax on digital services provided by tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Disney, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The move aims to create a level playing field between these global entities and local businesses. The tax could generate approximately 105 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) from 2025 to 2029, with 5% of these funds earmarked to support Philippine creative industries. On the analysts' front, KeyBanc Capital Markets has adjusted its price target for Netflix upward to $760 from the previous $735, maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares. The firm projects that Netflix could achieve earnings per share of approximately $24 in 2025 and $30 in 2026, marking an estimated 25% growth for each year. JPMorgan and Evercore ISI also show confidence in Netflix's potential, predicting that the streaming giant's ad revenue could account for more than 10% of total revenue by 2027 and maintaining an Outperform rating respectively. Netflix has scheduled its third quarter 2024 earnings release and has been making significant strides in its advertising business. The company's earnings announcement is set to be broadcast live on the Netflix Investor Relations YouTube channel, with management responding to questions from sell-side analysts. TD Cowen has reiterated a Buy rating for Netflix, indicating faith in the company's advertising growth trajectory. The firm predicts that advertising will represent 13% of Netflix's total revenue by 2029. Disney's proposed merger with Reliance's Indian media assets is facing regulatory hurdles due to concerns about monopolizing cricket broadcast rights. The companies may need to sell some of their cricket broadcast rights or commit to advertisement price caps for cricket matches to address these antitrust concerns. While Barclays has downgraded Netflix, citing concerns over growth prospects and valuation, recent data from InvestingPro offers a nuanced perspective on the streaming giant's financial position. Netflix's market capitalization stands at an impressive $308.87 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the entertainment industry. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.62 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This suggests that the stock may still offer value despite its recent price appreciation. Additionally, Netflix has demonstrated strong financial performance, with a revenue growth of 13.0% and an EBITDA growth of 50.33% over the same period. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt, which aligns with the article's mention of margin expansion and free cash flow expectations. This financial stability could provide Netflix with flexibility as it navigates new growth strategies and competitive challenges. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide further insights into Netflix's market position and financial health.

Title: Squarespace vs GoDaddy: Which is the better website builder?

Time Published: 2024-10-07T09:42:36Z

Feature-packed website builders for those with diverse needs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Squarespace is a top website builder known for its elegant designs and robust features. With over 100 premium, mobile-optimized templates, it’s a favorite for creatives and businesses seeking visually stunning, professional websites. GoDaddy Website Builder is a popular choice for beginners, offering a user-friendly interface and quick setup. With customizable templates and integrated marketing tools, it’s designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs create functional websites with ease. Creating a website is easier and more affordable than ever before. From no-code website builders to finding cheap domains and hosting plans, it seems like you can do it all for a couple of bucks. But, among countless brands, two stand out. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are well known as two of the best website builders on the market, but with many similar tools and features, it is no surprise potential customers often get confused about which one is best for them. Squarespace primarily offers a drag-and-drop website builder, dynamic website templates, and even multiple products targetting specific businesses such as dedicated templates for sellers, Bio Sites, creator tools for freelancers/ influencers, and SEO tools for digital marketers. GoDaddy's primary business is the sale of domains, and not very long ago, it started providing additional services like website building, logo making, and more. But this isn’t to say that GoDaddy isn’t a strong competitor in the website building space. In fact, in a short time, it has become one of the key players with powerful tools that are comparable to the likes of Squarespace. In this guide, we take a look at the most important areas of website building and offer a comparison between what is offered by the two players. The goal isn’t to give a generic answer to ‘which is the best website builder’, but instead provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision on which platform best suits your unique needs and goals. Squarespace pricing is straightforward, starting with the Personal plan. For $16/month (billed annually) you get features like a custom domain, SSL security, unlimited bandwidth, and Squarespace AI. If you need more, the Business plan for $23/month adds advanced website analytics, free invoices, promotional pop-ups, banners, and a nominal 3% transaction fee on sales. For ecommerce, the Basic Commerce plan at $27/month includes customer accounts, product waitlists, and low stock alerts and the Advanced Commerce plan adds advanced shipping, discounts, and abandoned cart recovery for $52/month. You can also save on your Squarespace subscription by signing up for an annual plan over monthly billing and using one of the best Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! GoDaddy, on the other hand, starts with the Basic plan at $9.99/month, ideal for small businesses that need SSL, unlimited social media platforms alongside unified inbox and website chat. On top of this, the Standard plan adds additional marketing tools like built-in SEO and social posts for $11.99/month. Next up, the Premium plan at $14.99/month includes all the benefits of the Standard plan, plus recurring appointments. Lastly, if you just want to build an online store, the Ecommerce plan at $24.99/month is the best choice as it covers all the essentials like product listings, shipping, and abandoned cart recovery. My Verdict: Squarespace is a premium option with higher pricing, ideal for businesses and creatives needing strong design and e-commerce features. GoDaddy offers more affordable, simple plans, perfect for beginners or businesses looking for a quick and easy website setup. Squarespace’s setup and editing process are both minimalist and visually appealing. With a Fluid Engine drag-and-drop editor, Squarespace offers real-time previews of your edits and even offers many AI features to improve your website. You get dedicated theme patterns, tons of templates distributed on an industry basis, and limited yet versatile font options to fulfill your brand’s persona. If you plan on running an online store, Squarespace has dedicated e-commerce themes and well-organized sections for payments, shopping carts, and products. GoDaddy’s layout may be less visually appealing, but its editor is simpler than Squarespace's, particularly for non-technical users. With a guided walkthrough to set up your site, you can add pictures, design pages, etc., using the swipe-to-style editor both from your desktop or even your phone. Plus, GoDaddy Airo AI creates your website, logo, and more by just using details of your business. Likewise, once your ecommerce store is ready, you can upgrade to start selling and connect with top marketplaces like Instagram, Google, Etsy, eBay, Facebook, and Amazon. My Verdict: Squarespace is perfect if you want a visually-driven, customizable setup, while GoDaddy is better for beginners who value ease of use and speed over advanced design and customization. Squarespace lets you send invoices and sell content like online courses, videos, blogs, memberships as well as physical products. Further, you can use your own domain for checkout and connect with different Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems, helping create a seamless experience for your customers. If you want to go all in with your store, Squarespace provides product reviews for your customers, features for selling your products and services on Facebook and Instagram, limited availability labels, and abandoned cart recovery. On high-tier plans, you get advanced options for shipping, discounts, and access to Commerce APIs. With the GoDaddy Ecommerce plan, you can create dedicated websites to sell products. Just integrate your online store to add products and services, set up payment methods, manage shipping options and return policies, warranties, and guarantees. Plus, you can highlight featured products, integrate Square, PayPal, and Stripe, and keep subscribers informed about sales, coupon offers, and online events along with email marketing tools. GoDaddy also lets you customize your online store with WordPress and WooCommerce integration. My Verdict: Both platforms have extensive ecommerce features and support flat-rate, calculated, and free shipping, along with a range of third-party app integrations. In a nutshell, consider Squarespace if you want a neatly designed and stunning-looking online store and GoDaddy if you’re a beginner on a tight budget who just wants to get started with a simple yet effective ecommerce website. When it comes to SEO, both Squarespace and GoDaddy let you edit tags and meta descriptions, add image alt text, customize URLs, and access keyword support. But there are a few things to consider. Squarespace site comes with a site map using the .xml format, so you don't need to create one manually. Squarespace also lets you add Meta Pixel & Ads for targeted advertising. Plus, you can explore keywords with time filters and access an SEO Checklist making optimizing your site a breeze.. On the other hand, GoDaddy has a step-by-step wizard that guides you through optimizing your homepage, and if you've used it before, you can revisit tasks to refine any page, blog post, or image. Similarly, you can track your site's performance using Google Analytics and return to optimize further as needed. My Verdict: While Squarespace comes with an integrated sitemap and Meta Pixel for users who prefer simplicity, GoDaddy’s SEO wizard provides a more guided, step-by-step approach for beginners. Since both offer quite basic SEO tools, you can try their free trial to see which one suits your business better. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are solid website builders, but they cater to different needs. GoDaddy is the cheaper and faster option, perfect for those who want to get online quickly without fussing over too many details. It’s great for beginners with its straightforward email marketing process and essential features at an affordable price. GoDaddy’s guided approach is ideal for those who want to get things up and running with minimal hassle. Squarespace, while more expensive, excels in aesthetics and creative control. Its beautiful templates, drag-and-drop editor, and powerful tools like built-in SEO and automatic sitemaps make it a top choice for creatives, artists, and anyone wanting to build a visually stunning online presence. A generous student discount also makes it a great option for young entrepreneurs and creators looking to save while building something professional. In the end, if speed, simplicity, and cost are your main concerns, GoDaddy wins. But if you're after elegance, customization, and appealing aesthetics, Squarespace is a better choice.

However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could weigh on investor sentiment this month. Nonetheless, investors could benefit by ignoring short-term noise and tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts to pick stocks with attractive long-term growth potential. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is CyberArk Software (CYBR), a cybersecurity company that is mainly focused on identity security. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance, indicating solid demand for its products. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg initiated coverage of CYBR stock with a buy rating and a price target of $328, calling it a top mid-cap cybersecurity idea. The analyst thinks that the company is in a "good position to consolidate identity spending and maintain durable and increasingly profitable growth." Hedberg expects CyberArk to sustain strong growth, driven by the demand for identity security and substantial room to grow within its core Privileged Access Management (PAM) market. Additionally, the analyst thinks that the company can grow beyond the PAM market by pursuing cross-sell opportunities in the Access, Secrets, Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) and machine identities markets. Hedberg also expects the company to benefit from its acquisition of Venafi, a machine identity specialist. He anticipates that Venafi's growth will rebound to more than 20% and be accretive to CyberArk's growth and margins over time. Overall, Hedberg is optimistic about a further rise in CyberArk's profitability and expects the company's organic growth to be above 20% for several years, backed by an estimated total addressable market (TAM) of $60 billion. Hedberg ranks No. 164 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.7%. (See CYBR Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) We move to the ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). After hosting meetings with the company's management, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reaffirmed a buy rating on UBER stock with a price target of $95. Highlighting the key takeaways from the meetings, Anmuth said that management is confident about achieving a three-year compound annual growth rate of mid- to high-teens for gross bookings, backed by a stable macro and demand backdrop since the second-quarter earnings. In particular, management stated that demand continues to be healthy in both the Mobility and Delivery businesses. Anmuth also noted the company's optimism about expanding its advertising business across Uber Eats and grocery. Notably, the ad business is on a run-rate of $1 billion (as of the second quarter) or about 1% of delivery gross bookings. In fact, delivery profits have improved over the recent quarters due to the high-margin ad business. Uber expects its grocery ad business to account for 5% of gross bookings over time. The analyst also pointed out the company's growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AV). "Uber can add value to AV tech providers by driving higher demand/utilization and building out the AV ecosystem through fleet operations," Anmuth said, based on discussions with management. Anmuth ranks No. 93 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. (See UBER Stock Buybacks on TipRanks) This week's third stock pick is social media company Meta Platforms (META). At the recently held Meta Connect event, the company highlighted Quest 3S, its latest virtual reality headset, as well as other innovations, including its latest prototype of augmented-reality (AR) smart glasses (Orion) and the new features of its Meta AI chatbot. Following the announcements at the event, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed a buy rating on Meta stock and boosted the price target to $605 from $530. The analyst attributed the higher price target to a number of factors, including significant opportunities to expand core monetization with artificial intelligence (AI)/generative AI features and the ongoing momentum in Messaging. His improved outlook also reflects "generally positive social media ad checks," with September looking better than the trends noted in August. The analyst raised his 2025 revenue and 2024 and 2025 earnings per share estimates to reflect stable macro trends, higher contributions from Messaging and enhancements related to devices and AI-driven platform. However, he slightly lowered his 2025 operating margin estimate to reflect increased networking and depreciation expenses. Commenting on Meta Connect, Sebastian said he thinks that this year's event reflects the significant progress the company has made with its Reality Labs division and AI/generative AI. Specifically, the analyst thinks that the Llama update provides a further edge to Meta's LLMs (large language models) over close rivals like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini. He is also optimistic about the innovations related to Meta AI assistant and expects it to be the most popular AI assistant by the end of 2024. Sebastian ranks No. 277 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.6%.

Title: Bose Reinvented Itself Just in Time. Now Comes the Tricky Part

Bose might have turned 60, but the audio company seems to be firmly settling into its graduate school era. After late founder Amar Bose donated majority ownership to MIT in 2011—a little-known fact—it became higher-ed’s most valuable audio brand, and broadened its focus. Gone are the days of wired speakers, or a few paltry headphone options to pair with your stylish Bose Wave CD radio. In the past four years with CEO Lila Snyder—a former 15-year McKinsey consultant who is herself an MIT graduate with a master’s in mechanical engineering—Bose has seemingly righted a ship that appeared to be banking toward shore. Snyder and her team grabbed the helm after Bose shuttered its retail stores in the middle of a global pandemic. She also helped turn a rickety start in the wireless earbud and Bluetooth speaker space into some of the sleekest, best-sounding models on the market. In a world where management consultants and tech executives are known for stripping companies for parts and raising prices, Snyder and a slimmed-down Bose have maintained the brand’s noise-canceling superiority in the face of stiff competition from Apple, Sony, and others. What impresses me most about the Bose of 2024 is that it doesn’t have to play to the trends that publicly traded brands do: It has been an innovator for six decades, and it continues to be in everything from product development to retail strategy. It has quietly been deciphering the tricks behind in-car noise cancelation and beam-forming glasses, and has been developing personal line array systems for small-venue musicians. Ten years ago, I'd tell folks that beyond its excellent noise canceling, Bose offered very little for most people. Now? I’d say the company is getting dangerously close to eating Sonos’ lunch. Bose’s boxy new Smart Soundbar can pair with its Ultra Open earbuds for immersive sound in a small space. There are very few brands that have pushed personal audio technology so far forward in the past six decades. From vinyl record players to CDs, and now the streaming and portable listening era, Bose has made competitive products for higher-end listeners, even though it made a few missteps along the way—a few absolutely huge and uncomfortable pairs of early wireless earbuds, for example. It can be a surreal culture to join, Snyder says. The first female CEO of Bose, Snyder grew up a tinkerer who saved up for her first Bose radio. “I grew up with Bose as an aspirational brand, and an iconic one. And it's funny to join a company when you have stories from your background, right?” Still, even though Snyder no longer has to save up for access to the latest kit, apparently new hires and old get the same repetitive query from folks in their personal orbits. “Every Bose employee will tell you that the most common question they get is, ‘Do you get a discount?’” Snyder jokes. The company has always had premium prices, but in certain categories the products haven't always matched the brand's prestige: 2010s attempts at noise-canceling earbuds were bulky, sounded middling, and had poor battery life; and it also sold a line of too-expensive Bluetooth speakers with screens that nobody needed. Then, after its physical storefronts were not having the billboard-like effect Bose wanted, the brand, just prior to Snyder joining, decided to dramatically pivot—a word that can so often be replaced with “panic”—to a strategy that focused on online sales and bolstering exhibits in existing storefronts such as Best Buy in the United States. This seismic shift meant that every single Bose store in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan shuttered, resulting in 119 store closures and hundreds of layoffs worldwide. So far, under Snyder's stewardship, that swerve toward online and in-store retail has, according to the company, worked out—but it could have gone the other way. Brands like Nike that have pivoted away from brand-owned retail stores have seen sales dives, but the key difference lies in Bose's decision to lean into retail partners. By bolstering exhibits in places such as Best Buy and other stores, as well as leaning into sales on Amazon and other online retailers besides its own website, Bose has been able to maintain a broad reach while also not keeping retail overhead in-house. According to Snyder, this slimmed-down approach has been effective in righting Bose's fortunes, especially when paired with excellent new products. In being a tech company that entirely focuses on audio products, Snyder says that the secret sauce at Bose is research. Engineers are constantly looking for innovation in materials, acoustics, design, production, and more. When asked about recent innovations in solid-state driver technology, for example, she isn’t shy about its prodigious market research. “What's interesting about Bose is we have been an audio company for 60 years,” says Synder. “We know we're going to be in competitive markets. We've always been in competitive markets, whether that's headphones, or in the home, or in the car. What makes us different is we're all about audio. You can be assured we experiment with everything. When we believe something’s ready, we bring it forward. We’re always looking for technology that can change the game.” This is particularly evident when it comes to noise canceling, which was pioneered by the brand for aviators—a market Snyder says Bose is proud to remain dominant in—rather than folks in the main cabin of the plane. By investigating what pilots needed to operate safely and comfortably in the cockpit, and constantly asking them for improvements and ideas, Bose was able to develop and trickle down what remain the best noise-canceling algorithms WIRED has ever tested. That makes sense, given that latest generation of Bose Quietcomfort over-ears and earbuds offer genuine professional-grade aerospace technology. Snyder says the brand uses professionals, or semi-professinals in the case of its PA gear for small-venue musicians, not only to improve its products but also to market to folks who are interested in higher-end audio. “They're a professional musician. They have a great ear. They know what great sound sounds like. Those products create a sort of halo.” However, a significant marketing tool Bose used for considerable time was NFL games, where it was the sideline sponsor for headsets for eight years, ending the partnership early this decade. The partnership has since been taken over by Sony. Bose CEO Lila Snyder at Bose headquarters Snyder with Bose’s latest over-ear headphones The other problems Bose faces are ones that top-tier makers in all industries suffer from: It must keep innovating to maintain its place atop the mountain of noise canceling; and it must continue to make other products, such as speakers and soundbars, that do the same. Current projects that excite Synder include the company’s developing work in car audio, aiming to help reduce the road noise in cars that’s even more apparent in the quieter electric vehicle era. “We have been, and we'll continue to be, everywhere that music is important to our customers,” Synder says, not-so-subtly hinting at new tech to come. “We're excited about what we're about ready to bring to the market.” In the weeks since our conversation, Bose has announced a new affordable pair of noise-canceling earbuds that have gotten rave early reviews (our review is forthcoming), as well as a new soundbar option that features an AI-based dialog mode. Bose also announced that you can pair its Ultra Open earbuds to the soundbar to use them as faux-rear speakers in surround sound—just the type of genre-bending listening she was alluding to. We expect to see more innovation and are keen to see what happens when Bose combines its beam-forming audio tech we've seen in its Frame sunglasses, and the noise-canceling and personal audio experiences it has been testing for the car. As has been true for much of its six decades, I have a feeling the best of Bose is yet to come.

Title: How to handle a potential Chinese 'bazooka'

Investing.com -- The recent stimulus announcements out of China have left investors raising questions about how to position themselves in case Beijing unleashes a more aggressive economic boost—a so-called “bazooka” stimulus. In a Tuesday note, Barclays analysts acknowledge that this is not their base case, but they emphasize that investors should prepare for such a scenario due to its potential to significantly impact global markets. Despite the recent rally in Chinese equities, the broader market reaction has been relatively subdued, leaving room for opportunities in other asset classes. Chinese equities have shown some of their largest movements in history, with the CSI 300 posting a staggering 1-week sigma move of +17.6. “The magnitude of these moves suggests that investors were unprepared for such announcements, and also that technicals, such as positioning, may have acted as a tailwind,” Barclays analysts noted. “Additionally, it also indicates that while there may be further room for upside, the bulk of the move in the near-term may be over.” The rally has largely been confined to Chinese equities and their proxies, such as European miners, but Barclays believes the real impact could come if China unveils a massive fiscal stimulus plan, like a CNY10 trillion package over two years. In such a scenario, the effects could spill over into global markets, creating opportunities in non-Chinese assets. “Notably, in a 'bazooka' scenario stimulus would likely have more farreaching effects on global assets, making upside opportunities on non-Chinese assets more attractive, given less extended moves and cheaper vol.,” analysts continued. They outlined several strategies to capitalize on this potential, focusing on oil, industrials, and U.S. stocks with high exposure to China. Among those, analysts discussed buying U.S. Oil Fund (USO (NYSE:USO)) calls, conditional on a stronger euro against the dollar, as oil is particularly sensitive to positive surprises in Chinese demand. A second opportunity lies in industrials, where Barclays advises buying hybrid XLI (Industrials) vs. SPY (S&P 500) call spreads. The Chinese credit cycle has historically been a strong leading indicator for industrials' performance, and a major stimulus could give this sector a significant boost. Finally, for investors looking for direct exposure to U.S.-China trade, Barclays screens for companies with high Chinese sales exposure and attractive volatility profiles. Top candidates include Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), which could see significant gains if China’s economy rebounds on the back of stimulus.

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Mizuho desk analysts said Friday they view Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as an "out of favor long idea," noting that negative headlines and concerns over declining iPhone sales have already been factored into the price. They expect iPhone sales for fiscal 2025, particularly for the iPhone 16, to remain relatively stable, forecasting flat to low single-digit declines year-over-year—better than many fear. According to the analysts, after a challenging period through March 2025, Apple's stock could rebound, driven by the preview of a new iOS in June and the release of a more AI-integrated iPhone 17 in September 2025. “Patience will be rewarded, near-term downside risk [is] limited as buy-side super negative and short,” the analysts commented. The team at Mizuho now anticipates a 6% decline in iPhone production for 2024, revising their estimate to 220 million units, down from the previous 90 million forecast for the iPhone 16 model. Despite the downgrade for 2024, they project a recovery in 2025, with unit sales expected to rise by 8% to 239 million. This growth would be supported by the introduction of a new iPhone SE and the expected launch of the iPhone 17. Looking further ahead, the forecast for 2026 suggests iPhone sales could reach roughly 250 million units. The analysts also estimate that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 will sell around 97 million units in 2025, which represents a 10% increase over the revised estimate for the iPhone 16. Moreover, they foresee Apple starting to use its own internal modem chips with the iPhone 18, phasing out Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems by the time the iPhone 18 launches. Apple is also expected to introduce a foldable iPhone in 2027, potentially spurring further investment in G6 OLED panels. Mizuho's team believes new AI features in iOS could drive stronger upgrade and replacement cycles beginning with the iPhone 17. “Buyside feedback could not be more negative on AAPL and iPhone supply chain,” analysts continued. “Feels like a lazy and super crowded short where buyside unit estimates for CY25 iPhone likely expect negative unit growth in low-single-digits year-on-year vs sell side consensus that was 5% growth and now likely flat year-on-year.” JPMorgan issued a cautionary note for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Thursday, adjusting its price target while still predicting a potential significant downside for the stock. The bank maintained its Underweight rating on Tesla but raised the price target from $115 to $130. Still, the new price implies a downside risk of nearly 50% from Tesla’s last closing share price. "TSLA shares fell -3.5% Wednesday vs. the S&P 500 flat, ostensibly upon the release of sales and production figures indicating 3Q global deliveries tracked modestly less than our estimate and in line with Bloomberg consensus but, from our conversations, may have represented more of a miss vs. investor expectations," JPMorgan stated. JPMorgan also warned that Tesla might see its first-ever full-year decline in unit volumes, which could threaten its hypergrowth valuation. Tesla's third-quarter deliveries of 464,000 units slightly missed JPMorgan's estimate but matched Bloomberg’s consensus forecast. However, analysts believe the figures may have underperformed relative to broader investor expectations. "The continued softer trend now appears to position Tesla to potentially not grow full-year unit volumes for the first time in its history," JPMorgan explained, suggesting that this could prompt investors to reconsider Tesla's standing as a growth stock. The report highlighted Tesla's resilience in the stock market, despite its deteriorating performance over the past two years. "While TSLA shares are flat to slightly higher over the past two years, expectations have crumbled for every performance metric," the note pointed out, citing declines in unit volumes, revenue, gross margin, and free cash flow. The analysts also stressed that Tesla's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2024 are now forecasted at $7.3 billion—a sharp 74% drop from the $28 billion projected two years ago for the same period. Bank of America (BofA) analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating for Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stock ahead of the company’s “Advancing AI” event on October 10. The analysts noted that AMD's previous AI event, held on December 6, led to significant stock gains of 19% and 80% over the following one and three months, respectively, outperforming the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s 10% and 37% increases during the same periods. The upcoming event is expected to feature roadmap updates in AI and server CPU, alongside comments from key cloud customers, which “could reinvigorate AMD stock,” the analysts said. AMD has recorded a modest 9% year-to-date (YTD) increase, trailing behind the SOX index's 22% rise. Despite growing competition in the AI accelerator market, BofA highlighted the potential for AMD to expand its market share. Consensus estimates project AMD’s AI sales to reach $5.1 billion in 2024, with the possibility of doubling to $10 billion in 2025. The current consensus for AMD’s AI sales over the 2024-2026 period stands at $5.1 billion, $9.7 billion, and $12.8 billion, respectively, which suggests AMD’s market share in AI accelerators will likely stay around 5-7%. This is significantly lower than its 20%+ market share in consumer CPUs and gaming GPUs. Although AMD has made strides in AI, BofA analysts cautioned that further expanding its market share could be difficult, given NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation’s commanding 80-85%+ market share and strong presence in cloud, along with competition from cost-optimized custom ASICs from companies like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL). However, if AMD demonstrates a viable strategy to capture more than 10% of the AI market share by 2026, it could add approximately $5 billion in sales, with potential earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $8-$9, compared to the current consensus of $7.37. “Faster growth could also help AMD rerate towards 30-55x forward price-to-earnings (PE) it managed to trade during prior periods of rapid share gains and 40%+ annual sales growth,” BofA analysts said. “We expect AMD to emphasize its improving end-end positioning including recent acquisitions (ZT Systems, Silo AI), open-source software (ROCm) and networking (infinity fabric),” they added. Loop Capital analysts reiterated their bullish outlook on Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) this week, maintaining a Buy rating and affirming that the stock is still on track to reach $1,000 (pre-10-for-1 stock split), despite recent news of a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation. In their note, Loop Capital downplayed the significance of the DOJ inquiry, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The analysts speculated that the investigation likely pertains to shipments to countries such as China and Russia but emphasized that this is unlikely to impact Super Micro’s ongoing operations. “SMCI would be able to keep doing what it needs to do to get the 10-K filed while handling anything with the DOJ separately,” the analysts wrote. They also pointed out that Super Micro might have already been aware of the DOJ probe. Although the company has yet to publicly acknowledge the investigation, Loop Capital noted that management seemed "constructive" during recent investor events in September, suggesting that the AI server maker could already be addressing the situation. “We believe there is a legitimate possibility SMCI was already aware of anything that may now be going on with the DOJ,” the analysts added. Loop Capital remains optimistic about Super Micro’s long-term prospects, projecting normalized revenues of $40 billion, with a return to 14% gross margins and 10% operating margins. The analysts argue that these fundamentals could result in a $50 normalized earnings per share (EPS) and a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 20x, supporting their view that SMCI is “a $1,000 stock.” Northland Capital Markets upgraded Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to Outperform following the launch of Agentforce, a platform integrating Agentic AI technology. Northland highlights that Agentforce has not only matched Microsoft’s advancements in AI but may have surpassed them in terms of AI evolution. Officially rolled out on September 12th, the platform allows for the deployment of GenAI agents across sales, service, marketing, and commerce workflows. Agentforce is powered by the Atlas reasoning engine and the xLAM series of Large Action Models. This technology eliminates the need for coding to build agents on the platform. In addition, the system’s ability to transfer tasks to human agents when dealing with complex or ambiguous scenarios is seen as a key innovation, ensuring high levels of relevance and accuracy in its autonomous agents. Northland Capital Markets also mentioned the platform’s pricing model, which is based on consumption and averages $2 per conversation. This structure is designed to capture part of the value that GenAI delivers to customers. The analysts expect this development to significantly expand Salesforce’s total addressable market (TAM) for software from $0.8 trillion to $3.2 trillion, representing a four-fold increase. “We believe CRM is well positioned to capitalize on the more than 4x in software TAM we expect GenAI will drive,” Northland’s team wrote in its report. The firm extended its discounted cash flow (DCF) forecast from 8 years to 13 years, showing confidence that Salesforce is no longer constrained by average revenue per user (ARPU) limitations. As a result, Northland Capital Markets raised its 12-month price target for Salesforce to $400, up from $270.
