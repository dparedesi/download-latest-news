Title: BlackRock Issues Bitcoin Supply Shock Warning, Says There’s Not Enough Coins for US Millionaires

The largest asset manager in the world says there is not enough Bitcoin (BTC) to meet the demand from American millionaires. In a new report titled “Why bitcoin? A perspective from model portfolio builders,” BlackRock analysts Michael Gates and Brett Wager details how Bitcoin is inelastic to demand, unlike gold. Unlike the yellow metal, the analysts point out that BTC has no ability to meet excess demand with increased supply, as its supply is hard-capped and its inflation schedule is already set in stone. “As many know, there is a predictable issuance schedule of new bitcoin until 2140 with a pre-programmed max supply of 21 million tokens. However, less widely known is that the real available float is likely far smaller, with a conservative estimate of 3 to 4 million issued bitcoins visible on the blockchain but considered permanently inaccessible (and therefore out of circulation) due to lost, forgotten, or otherwise destroyed keys. To illustrate how few available bitcoins there are, if every millionaire in the US asked their financial advisor to get them 1 bitcoin, there wouldn’t be enough.” BlackRock says that its Model Portfolio Solutions team sees several “substantive arguments that support Bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” “Namely, to potentially serve as a novel store of value and global monetary alternative, hedge to US dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the broader ‘offline’ to ‘online’ digital transition of goods and services – supercharged by ‘boomer-to-millennial’ demographic tailwinds. Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,381.

Title: LA Times Will Label Opinion Articles With AI-Powered ‘Bias Meter’

The Los Angeles Times has seen better days as the company’s billionaire owner continues taking a wrecking ball to the nearly 150-year-old institution. Waves of layoffs and editorial interference by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a vocal Trump supporter, has tanked morale, and now the owner has set his sights on AI as the panacea that will improve trust and, ultimately, the fortunes of the newspaper. Soon-Shiong announced this week that opinion articles will now include an AI-powered bias meter that labels articles based on an algorithm’s perceived interpretation of its political leanings. The new labels include âLeft, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right,â and are determined by a startup called Particle.News, which was founded by former Twitter engineers. There will also be a section called “Viewspoints,” powered by AI startup Perplexity, that will display alternative views to those put forth in an article. These new AI products will apply not just to opinion pieces but any âarticles that offer a point of view on an issue,â according to a statement received by The Guardian. Opinion-oriented articles will be more clearly delineated from straight news reports with a new “Voices” label. Standard news articles will not include the AI features. Voices and Insights button now live â¦@latimesâ©. Try it. Now the voice and perspective from all sides can be heard, seen and read âno more echo chamber. Thanks to our talented content management software team running this Graphene platform pic.twitter.com/HslD5dKinz — Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) March 3, 2025 Trust in media is notoriously low, and it is worth experimenting to see how the tide can be turned. But it is all a bit ironic that Soon-Shiong claims to be trying to improve trust in the media while he repeatedly interferes in reporting. The billionaire caught flak in 2024 after sharing on X an opinion piece that the original author claimed was altered after submission to make it appear more positive about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Multiple staffers left after Soon-Shiong similarly interfered in an article regarding one of his friends who got into an altercation over a dog attack. It does not instill much “trust” when the billionaire owner is second-guessing journalists’ decisions about newsworthiness and getting personally involved when reporters are investigating his friends. While the Times’ editorial union is not necessarily opposed to displaying alternative opinions against an article, they say that AI is not the way to do this. The AI-generated viewpoints will not be scrutinized by editors, and of course, AI models continue to make up information and get basic queries wrong (during the recent Oscars, ChatGPT surfaced nominees from the wrong year). Already, the Guardian reports that some of the contrasting viewpoints suggested by the AI tool were featured in the article itself. âThe money for this endeavor could have been directed elsewhere: supporting our journalists on the ground who have had no cost-of-living increase since 2021,â said Matt Hamilton, vice president of the LATimes Guild. It seems inevitable that we are heading towards a place where the internet is rife with AI-created, pseudo-academic writing filled with made-up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into âknowledgeâ as those articles become the training fodder for future models. How much of this will end up in the alternative viewpoints on Times articles?Â Perplexity, it should be noted, has shown disdain for the journalism industry in general by scraping articles and regurgitating them almost whole-cloth in its chatbot, claiming fair use over the practice. When New York Times staffers went on strike last year during labor negotiations, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to provide AI tools that he suggested could replace them. Showing similar disdain for his own employees, it would not be surprising to see Soon-Shiong expand the use of AI to write entire articles. Other news organizations have experimented with AI in small and subtle ways. The Washington Post now automatically summarizes articles and surfaces key points at the top. That newspaper is experiencing its own turmoil as billionaire owner Jeff Bezos pivots from a hands-off ownership to exerting more control and making its opinion section entirely pro-capitalism and “free markets.” The Post lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers since Bezos blocked the newspaper from endorsing Kamala Harris and has again bled subscribers following the changes to the opinion section. It was only a few years ago that the likes of Bezos appeared to be benevolent billionaires who would swoop in and save legacy media from the destruction wrought by the internet. We were naive to believe that. This was always going to be the problem with news organizations owned by billionaires with conflicting interests. Today, the name of the game is pleasing President Trump so he does not go on the attack against Amazon, and perhaps tosses Blue Origin some new contracts.

Title: Grind school expansion in South Dublin sparks concern among school principals over loss of students

One of the country’s fastest-growing grind schools is expanding to include transition year students in a move which some principals fear will draw students away from secondary schools in the South Dublin area. The Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan in South Dublin, which has about 340 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students, is oversubscribed and has confirmed that it is moving to a larger premises in Blackrock where it plans to expand enrolment to 500 students in September. The academy, where full-time students pay €10,495 a year, is moving to Frascati House, the old Zurich Insurance building, which is the subject of a €7 million retrofitting project to turn it into a 28,000 square foot campus. Its larger competitor, the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street – which has 1,650 students and charges annual fees of up to €11,000 a year – is also oversubscribed. Privately, some school principals in the South Dublin area complain that they are losing students to grind schools during senior cycle against the backdrop of a CAO points race for entry to third level. Some school leaders say students who leave school to move to grind schools risk dropping out of team sports and cultural activities, as well as losing a sense of connection to their school communities, although grind schools dispute this. The Dublin Academy of Education made the announcement on Tuesday as it also disclosed that it is now part of a newly established education group comprising Independent College, International House Dublin and Public Affairs Ireland. The Axis Education Group is jointly held by education entrepreneur Chris Lauder, who founded the Dublin Academy of Education, and investor Donagh Barry. [ Grind schools are booming. Would they offer any advantage in a properly resourced education system?Opens in new window ] The new group employs more than 220 academic and administrative staff and serves over 20,000 learners through in-person and online educational services, with a combined turnover of €20 million. [ ‘We’re fully booked’: How grind schools became big businessOpens in new window ] As part of the group’s establishment, Mr Lauder has taken on the role of group chief executive. Padraig Hourigan – who is president and chief executive of Independent College – recently sold his stake in the company. He has been appointed group director of strategy and partnerships for the Axis Education Group. Mr Lauder said the group aimed to “empower learners” at every stage of their education journey. “It’s not just about preparing students for exams and getting the best results possible,” he said. “It’s about preparing students for their lives after the Leaving Certificate and developing in them the confidence, mindset and skills required to succeed at third level and beyond – whatever profession they decide to go into.” In addition to today’s investment announcement in the campus in Blackrock, the group says it has “ambitious” plans for growth and development over the next 24-36 months. “Our educational institutions have proven their ability to have transformative impact in their parts of the education sector, and we want to do more,” Mr Lauder said. “In addition to our new Blackrock campus and provision of a transition-year programme at the academy, we’re also increasing our range of postgraduate programmes at Independent College to include digital business, AI and business analytics, as well as looking to further expand our geographic footprint in Dublin.” .

Title: Tesla Sales in Europe Suffer from Political Fallout

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info Tesla sales are collapsing in Europe as the public are put off by Elon Musk’s vocal support for Donald Trump. It’s an object lesson in how politics can come at a cost to business, says Eliot Wilson Last week it was reported that Tesla sales in Europe fell by 45 per cent in January compared to the same month in 2024, despite the market for electric vehicles being otherwise buoyant. This has led to inevitable speculation that the European public is turning away from the brand because of the high-profile and controversial involvement of its CEO, Elon Musk, in the provocative antics of Donald Trump’s second presidency: politics is costing him money. Let us get some technical aspects out of the way which Musk’s supporters will – with justification – offer in mitigation. First, Tesla sales have tended to dip in January over recent years, though not by such a substantial margin. Second, the company’s Model Y compact crossover SUV, its bestselling model, is undergoing a facelift: the new version was launched in China in January for delivery there and in the United States, Canada and Mexico beginning in March, and it has only just become available to order in Europe. The evidence suggests it is more than this, however. Electrifying.com, an advice site and marketplace for electric vehicles, found that 60 per cent of car buyers have been put off purchasing a Tesla because of Musk’s political views and activities. It is at least a contributory factor. Musk is a deeply unpredictable and volatile personality. His views can change hugely – he supported the Democratic candidate in every presidential election from 2008 to 2020 – but he never pursues his ideology du jour with anything less than absolute and fervent dedication. When he eventually endorsed Donald Trump in July last year, he followed that up with $277m and became the largest individual donor of the election. In the same way, Musk has used his position as head of Trump’s new Doge(Department of Government Efficiency, not in fact a department but a temporary organisation within a rebranded US Digital Service) to attack the bureaucracy of the federal government with an impulsive, reckless ferocity. His supposed efficiency savings, through mass redundancies and unilateral institutional changes, have been carried out with hyper-partisan relish. When you own a social media platform with more than half a billion active monthly users like X, you can be sure your message will be heard. Donald Trump’s popularity in Europe lags far behind his domestic approval ratings. A recent survey showed that in many countries, only a third of people think the president’s re-election is “a good thing” for US citizens, falling to a fifth who expect it to benefit their own country. This will matter not at all to Trump with his relentless “America First” focus, and Musk, who sleeps little anyway, will not lose any of it over associated unpopularity in itself. But the Tesla sales figures suggest that his political reputation is having commercial and financial consequences, even if, as the richest person in the world, he can afford to shrug it off. It is worth noting, however, that Musk’s estimated net worth has fallen by $100bn in the past two months. His wealth, on paper at least, is so great it loses any real meaning: it is comparable to the GDP of Chile or Pakistan. But so substantial a fall demonstrates a relationship which Musk and others on the Trumpian right are eager to point out to their opponents: in business, politics isn’t cost-free. Two of the most totemic objects of hatred for many right-wingers are diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social and governance (ESG). They are regarded as policies which have been foisted on private enterprise by a pious, do-gooding liberal elite – the unrepresentative obsessions of people who are either misguided or actively malign. DEI and ESG are intrinsically political activities, says the Right, and the private sector will suffer financial consequences for pursuing them. It may be, however, that Musk himself is the object lesson in the dangers of politicisation There has been a movement away from these priorities. Last year, BlackRock significantly downgraded its ESG investments with some proposals labelled “overly prescriptive [and] lacking economic merit”. Similarly, whether it is accurate or not, DEI has created a perception of reverse discrimination and a diminution of meritocracy, and is now firmly in the sights of Doge. Musk inevitably took criticism to the extreme in January 2024 after an Alaskan Airlines Boeing 737 MAX suffered a mid-air panel blowout. “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening.” DEI and ESG are intrinsically political activities, says the Right, and the private sector will suffer financial consequences for pursuing them. It may be, however, that Musk himself is the object lesson in the dangers of politicisation. He waded heedlessly into the political arena, and customers are deserting him.

Title: Deal struck to bring ports on both sides of Panama Canal under American control

A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction, which must be approved by Panama's government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama's government. In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports “give China ready observation posts” to take action. “This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,” Cruz said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations. Panama quit China’s Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio’s visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. Belt and Road is Beijing’s global development strategy to build roads, ports and railways to open up new markets. But while much attention was focused on Trump’s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal. Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," Sixt said. In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited. BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal. Shares in BlackRock fell 1.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN analysis By Annabel Crabb Topic:Women The uptick in showy displays of aggression and "masculine energy" across America's tycoon community is undeniable since Trump's return. There are no rules — and should be no judgement — about how International Women's Day should be marked. Not everyone's a fan of pink cupcakes and special breakfasts full of women who are a little bit crying on the inside from having to get it together even earlier than usual. Some ladies contain themselves to the quiet ritual of doing one and a half times as much housework as their husbands, just like every other day. That said, I think we can agree that America's IWD 2025 game plan is a departure from form. 10am: Build giant pile of workplace pro-equality programs out by the lake house. 11am: Torch it while Elon Musk fires multiple AK-47s into the air, screaming "Merit For Ever!" while in a nearby hut, an employee delivers his 14th child. 1pm: Fight Club in the Oval Office, in which a confirmed draft-dodger and a guy who was a press secretary in the Marines double-team a third guy who is fighting an actual war right now, while reporters razz him about his outfit. Sunset: Pig hunting with Mark Zuckerberg. US President Donald Trump has outlawed diversity and inclusion programs across the US in what he described (with customary self-effacement) as "the most important federal civil rights measure in decades". Appointments in the US will henceforth be made on merit, or — in the case of the executive order concerning the Department of Defense — "merit and lethality". This may explain why the Senate confirmation hearings for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose previous gig was weekend-hosting Fox & Friends, included an inquiry as to how many push-ups he could do. "I did five sets of 47 [Trump is the 47th president] this morning," Hegseth replied, adding — as would any accountability-minded preschooler — "My brother saw it." Fortune 500 companies have adopted the president's DEI death sentence with remarkable speed. Forbes magazine has been monitoring the daily deletions of diversity targets from top-end corporate bumf and reports that in recent weeks Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock and Citigroup joined the exodus. Even Pepsi — known for making a multi-million-dollar woke goose of itself with Kendall Jenner in 2017 — is "transitioning" its chief diversity officer to "a broader role". And on Saturday, as the schoolboy fight video from the Oval Office metastasised across the globe, Forbes reported that Manhattan asset management firm State Street was the latest quiet abandoner of gender and ethnicity targets. Why is this especially interesting? Well, because for International Women's Day in 2017, during Donald Trump's first term, State Street commissioned and installed the now-famous "Fearless Girl", a four-foot bronze statue of a pig-tailed lass staring down the NY Stock Exchange, which the company extolled as an artistic manifestation of its commitment to diversity. The Fearless Girl's plinth bears an exhortation to "Know the power of women in leadership," confirming her status for State Street circa 2025 as "110kg of regrettable tattoo". The Fearless Girl faces off against the Charging Bull near Wall Street. (AP: Mark Lennihan) And look — something had to give, to be fair. In the recently concluded era when diversity and inclusion were cool, the male ranks of CEOs among America's 500 biggest companies fell to a frightening low of 90 per cent. There were even, at one point in 2023, nine African American CEOs in that hallowed number. But it was more than that. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan, in a three-hour January exchange much occupied with mixed martial arts and the merits of bows and arrows while hunting pigs, that business leadership in the DEI age had starved itself of masculine energy. "I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung towards being this somewhat more neutered thing and I didn't really feel that until I got involved in martial arts," he mused. "You have to be at least somewhat aggressive, yeah." As Prospect editor Alan Rusbridger (an amateur pianist gamely overcoming what we might term the "mandicap" of his own gentle hobby) translated from the Zuckerbergese: "What Mark is saying is that the pendulum has swung too far and it's time for blokes to be able to talk about whether Arsenal needs a new striker PDQ first thing in the morning without feeling they're about to be reported by the diversity, equality and inclusion team. Which, in Meta's case, Mark has just fired." Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk during Donald Trump's inauguration (Reuters: Julia Demaree Nikhinson) The uptick in showy displays of aggression and "masculine energy" across the heavyweight section of America's tycoon community is undeniable since Trump's return to power. What is truly fascinating, though, is that behind such hysterical braggadocio lies the truth of what these putative alpha males are doing. Which is: engaging in the most obsequious display of brown-nosing and forelock-tugging available on God's green earth, with the possible exception of North Korea. What is the chicken here, and what is the egg? Does the Trump ascendancy formally liberate the C-suite cavemen who were hiding under their desks this whole time? Or are these urgent new corporate hobbies (mixed martial arts, belchin', fartin', scratchin', hog-shootin') just the best roll of the dice for a broligarch all too whimperingly aware that his day job right now is to abase himself completely among the cheeseburger wrappers at the feet of a 78-year-old reality TV star? Let's turn to Australia, where a good number of the multinationals scrambling to unhitch the DEI wagon still have certain reporting and disclosure obligations under Australian law. And where opposition leader Dutton — like Trump — has accumulated a significant surge in support among young men. A consolidated Freshwater poll published by the Australian Financial Review last month found that among men aged 18 to 34, Dutton was supported by 37 per cent, while only 27 per cent of young women shared their enthusiasm. Major party leaders are making appearances on popular podcasts as the election nears. Dutton's public commentary has been much milder than Trump's, and he has firmly discouraged various of his more excitable Coalition colleagues — for now at least — from galloping off on the kinds of pro-life and anti-trans crusades that the US president harnessed profitably in his campaign. It was shadow Finance Minister Jane Hume, not Dutton, who on Tuesday announced the Coalition's policy to force public servants back to the office five days a week, a move whose impact is expected to disadvantage women more than men. But he absolutely associates himself with the sentiment that men are "fed up" with diversity initiatives in their workplaces. "I think a lot of young males feel disenfranchised and feel ostracised," the opposition leader told businessman and podcaster Mark Bouris in January. "They're pushing back and saying, 'Well, why am I being overlooked at work for a job, you know, three jobs running when I've got, you know, a partner at home, and she's decided to stay at home with three young kids, and I want a promotion at work so that I can help pay the bills at home,' and so I think all of that has morphed." Bouris is best known (apart from his TV and podcasting commitments) as a company chairman. Peter Dutton is the leader of the Liberal Party. Across the ASX200, Bouris's type of job is held 87 per cent of the time by men. And Dutton's job has never — in 80 years of the Liberal Party's existence — been held by a woman. It's hard to imagine that either man would ever argue that they had been, in their careers, professionally thwarted by women. This is not to suggest, however, that the sentiment the pair discussed on the podcast is imaginary or made-up. It's very real, widespread, and now very clearly having an effect on voting intention among young men. In her new book Patriarchy Inc, the Melbourne-based psychologist, neuroscientist and philosopher Cordelia Fine cites recent research indicating that just over half of Australian professional men feel they suffer from reverse discrimination. In France, she writes, this view is shared by 46 per cent of men. In Great Britain, 59 per cent. New data shows Australia's gender pay gap has narrowed, but working women are still more than $28,000 a year worse off than the average man. Does the feeling square with reality? Well. Tuesday's annual WGEA gender pay gap report found that the average pay gap between men and women in Australia continues to hover around 21 per cent. This does not mean employers are paying a man more than they pay a woman doing the exact same job. That's been illegal for decades. The disparity arises from the fact that women on average are more likely to be doing the less well-paid jobs, and men the better-paid ones. In other words, the WGEA figures are a clear demonstration that one gender is indeed being more regularly passed over for promotions to better-paying jobs in Australia, and it's not men. It's still women, just like most years. So what's caused this feeling among young men? A couple of theories. First: Girls generally outperform boys at Year 12, with a couple of subject exceptions. And females have been completing graduate degrees at Australian universities in greater numbers than males for decades. The gender inequities in Australian workplaces don't really kick in until people start having kids, when women are more likely to leave the workforce for a bit, and then get paid a bit less than they're worth when they get back and miss out on promotions and bonuses and professional opportunities than men their age are more likely to enjoy interruptedly. But a young man looking at his comparably-aged female colleague doesn't see that, and why would he? Humans always evaluate situations from their own perspective and life experience, especially when that experience has been a relatively comfortable or unchallenged one. Second: If he's a decent chap who would never think of sexually harassing someone, he might also feel affronted by workplace campaigns that are designed to protect women (who are disproportionately more likely to be on the receiving end of such misbehaviour). Sign up to the ABC Politics newsletter with Brett Worthington Third: While there is much hot air wasted on "identity politics", the truth is that most politics concerns identity. It's just less visible when the identity concerned matches your own. The assessment implicit in Dutton's words, for instance — that a young father of three with a stay-at-home spouse should not be passed over for promotion at work — is its own form of identity politics. It's clear that the opposition leader has met such a young man and remembered him because the unfairness of that particular story chimed with him. A female politician might — influenced by her own life experience and those of her friends — be more likely to summon the story of an older woman attempting to resume her career after her children were grown, being passed over because her "career breaks" rendered her professional experience invalid. That happens a lot too. All of us, as humans, view the world through the prescription lenses of our own backgrounds and identities. It's a factory defect in our design, and one that leads to great confusion, grief and damage. It would be amazing if we could all get better at taking the specs off now and again and having a squint through someone else's. But until then, the best way around the problem is to make sure there's a decent variety of views in the room. Especially when we're making big decisions.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: American asset management giant BlackRock has agreed to buy two ports at either end of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based firm whose ownership had angered President Donald Trump. Trump said several times during the lead-up to his inauguration and since taking office that he intends to “take back” the Panama Canal from Panama, which took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. And he cited Chinese ownership of some of the port operations as a sign that China is now running the canal. “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” said Trump during his inaugural address. At a January press conference ahead of his inauguration, Trump would not rule out using either military force or economic coercion to take control of the canal once again. The deal announced Tuesday called for BlackRock and a consortium of fellow investors to spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong company. It said the deal is an “agreement in principle.” BlackRock’s consortium is also buying CK Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, but none of the ports it operates in China or Hong Kong. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth,” said a statement from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. “Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison … and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.” BlackRock is one of the world’s largest asset managers, with an enormous pool of $11.6 trillion in assets. For context, that sum is equal to about 40% of the United States’ gross domestic product, the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity. Unlike some conglomerates, its doesn’t completely control a large number of high-profile companies. But among its holdings, it owns the second-largest stake in some of the nation’s largest and most successful companies, including Walmart, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet. CK Hutchison is one of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s flagship companies. The firm said in a stock exchange filing that it expects to receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale. Its shares soared more than 20% when they opened for trading on Wednesday. The Panama Canal was constructed by the United States in the early years of the 20th century and was completed in 1914. For most of that century it was operated by the US, before the Carter Administration negotiated its handover to Panama in a controversial treaty opposed by many Republicans at the time. The 51-mile canal is a key to both the movement of international trade and US military vessels. About 4% of the world’s maritime trade and more than 40% of US container traffic traverses canal. And it is a key part of Panama’s economy. In 2024, the canal earned nearly $5 billion in total profits. According to a study released in December by IDB Invest, 23.6% of Panama’s annual income is generated from the canal and companies that provide services related to the canal’s operations. Since its handover in 1999 the canal itself has been operated by Panama, not the Chinese, despite Trump’s stated concerns. The White House did not have an immediate comment on the purchase, although it appears likely that it could assuage Trump’s concerns about Chinese influence over the waterway. Mike Waltz, the administration’s national security adviser, told reporters late last month that the leadership of Panama had entered into “negotiations about addressing the ports on either side of the canal.” But removing Chinese influence is only part of Trump’s demands on Panama, including that Panama stop charging fees to American vessels. During his first trip abroad as Secretary of State, which began with a stop in Panama, Marco Rubio said he agreed that US vessels be allowed to traverse the canal at no charge. Rubio said that the US would be obligated to protect the Panama Canal if it came under attack, adding that he found it “absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.” “Those are our expectations. They were clear. They were clearly understood in those conversations,” he said after leaving Panama. — CNN’s Patrick Oppman, Phil Mattingly and Andrew Sager contributed to this report.

U.S. stocks plummeted again on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 670 points as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%. The S&P 500, which had its worst day of the year on Monday, dropped 1.2%. Tesla (TSLA+0.76%) stock declined on Tuesday due to rising fears about tariffs among investors — car prices may be driven higher by the duties. The company also has a large presence in China, including a major assembly plant, and so may be vulnerable to retaliation by Beijing. Additionally, Bank of America (BAC-1.46%) reduced its price target for the stock to $380 from $490 while maintaining a Neutral rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas yesterday designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised his price target to $430. Target’s (TGT-1.04%) stock fell after it said it expects a “meaningful” year-on-year decline in first-quarter profits compared and CEO Brian Cornell warned that the new tariffs may prompt the retailer to increase prices as soon as next week. The company’s fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. Best Buy (BBY+0.70%) stock dropped 12% after company executives warned that the duties could increase the prices of goods it sells and could reduce its comparable sales if they stay in place for a full year. The electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Chipotle (CMG+0.41%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados that are 50% sourced from Mexico. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand the tariffs. — Francisco Velasquez and Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

Print The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries. The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing. In January, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports "give China ready observation posts" to take action. "This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security," Cruz said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jose Raul Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations. Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. But while much attention was focused on Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal. Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/04/2025 9:19:12 AM PST by Miami Rebel A BlackRock-led consortium has agreed a $22.8 billion deal to buy two major Panama Canal ports owned by a Hong Kong-based conglomerate following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump over alleged Chinese interference in the critical trade route. The sale is a victory for Trump, the Financial Times noted. The president had repeatedly suggested the US could take the Canal back, citing national security concerns: The waterway is controlled by Panama, but the ports at either end are privately owned. This deal brings two at either entry to the Canal under US ownership. The BlackRock-led group will acquire a 90% stake in current owner CK Hutchison’s subsidiary that operates the two ports, according to a BlackRock statement Tuesday.

Title: How Trump’s Tariffs Are Ushering In A New World Order
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/03/04/how-trumps-tariffs-are-ushering-in-a-new-world-order/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T17:00:41Z
Full Content:
Today is the day: The sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that President Donald Trump has been talking about since his term began are here. Whether or not they would actually start today was an open question until late Monday afternoon when Trump confirmed them, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, upping new tariffs on the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner to 20%. The announcement sent many key economic indicators way down. Stocks fell across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P cratering. Chip maker Nvidia took an unusually deep tumble, with its stock falling more than 8.6%—though that can be partially attributed to how Chinese buyers are getting around export controls to get Nvidia’s powerful AI chips, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The across-the-board selloff continued Tuesday morning, with all indexes dropping more than 1.4% in the first hour of trading. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a constantly updated forecast of GDP growth based on real-time economic conditions, plummeted from more than 2% to -2.8% based on the tariff announcement. Analysts say that Trump is watching the stock market closely and may use it as an indicator to temper his policies. Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin write that the markets may be the only true check on Trump’s policies—the Republican majority Congress has so far bowed to his wishes with few questions, and many judicial rulings against Trump’s agenda have been appealed and largely unheeded so far. In his first term, Klebnikov and Schifrin write, Trump paid attention to the markets, signing a 2018 trade agreement with China after a tariff announcement caused the markets to fall 5% in one week. But Trump’s reaction may not be the same this week. After all, he’s been talking about tariffs since the campaign trail, calling himself the “Tariff Man” and proclaiming tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” A post on Truth Social yesterday tells farmers that they should get ready to export less because of the coming levies—“Have fun!” China immediately announced retaliatory tariffs and blacklisted some U.S. companies, while Canada introduced a slate of its own charges on the U.S. Target CEO Brian Cornell warned consumers will likely see higher prices this week, since the bulk of fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico this time of year. But Trump is sure to trumpet tariffs and his economic plan at his address to Congress tonight. The reception—both from Congress and Americans watching—will be telling. And this is just one set: New tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and reciprocal tariffs on all countries are slated to go into effect next month. Even if it all goes away or is reduced, Trump's aggressive policy swings may not bode well for the economy as a whole. Forbes senior contributor Christian Weller wrote about the most recent Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, compiled by researchers from Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago. Policy uncertainty leads to a slowing economy, with lower consumer sentiment and industrial production. In other words, certainty is a vital ingredient for economic growth. Since Trump’s election, the uncertainty index has increased by more than 66%. The way businesses operate is likely seeing a permanent change from Trump’s tariffs. Last week, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what it means to business leaders. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. And a reminder that we’re seeking feedback from leaders to help compile Forbes’ next installment of the New Ivies—the public and private colleges that are graduating the most prepared and competitive young talent. Please share your experience in this survey. getty The saga of the Corporate Transparency Act continues. This week, the Treasury Department announced that only foreign companies need to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. President Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, saying the CTA reporting was an “outrageous and invasive” requirement. It’s not surprising Trump doesn’t like the law—he vetoed the bill that contained it in 2021. A bipartisan coalition in Congress overrode his veto. The law sought to shed some light on anonymous shell companies, and as written, required companies to disclose who controls it to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Since it became law, the CTA’s beneficial ownership information reporting requirement has been challenged in federal court cases, putting the requirement on hold, then allowing it to go forward. Before this announcement, the requirement was back, and FinCEN extended the reporting deadline to March 21. It’s unclear what will happen with the still-pending cases. Also unclear: Whether the Republican-majority Congress will object to the president unilaterally halting a bipartisan initiative. President Donald Trump. Since the campaign trail, Trump has said he will create a national cryptocurrency reserve. He announced it on Truth Social over the weekend, saying that the new “crypto strategic reserve” will have bitcoin and ethereum at its core, but will also include XRP, solana and ADA. The announcement builds on a January 23 executive order to create a working group to propose regulations for cryptocurrency and evaluate a “national digital asset stockpile.” However, many big names in crypto and tech didn’t like Trump’s weekend announcement. Forbes’ Derek Saul writes that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that the best option would be using only bitcoin to become the “successor to gold” for the government. Trump supporter and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale said it’s “wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes” and “not the proper, principled role of government” to finance a crypto reserve. And Jason Calacanis, who co-hosts the “All-In” Silicon Valley podcast with Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks, called the move the “Trump Pump” and called it “an insane grift.” A table at a job fair in Florida last year. While it hasn’t shown up yet in economic reports, major U.S. job losses are coming. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that retail closures at national chains Party City and Joann’s will bring 16,000 and 19,000 fewer jobs, respectively. Estée Lauder, Starbucks, Kohl’s and Walmart have also announced major layoffs. And outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported retail job cuts in January were 20% higher than a year ago. Massive job cuts are on the way in other sectors as well. Through Elon Musk’s federal spending slashing as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, tens of thousands of federal government employees have lost their jobs. The job slashing continues, with agencies reportedly offering employees up to $50,000 to voluntarily resign. Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Trump’s tariffs are going from largely a threat to reality today, causing major changes for many businesses worldwide. Before most of them took effect, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what businesses should be doing. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How have tariff threats impacted businesses so far? Johnson: Tariffs increase prices. Prices will go up. If I’m a business leader, the odds are greater than zero that the tariffs will be put in place. When they do, I know that that product for me is going to go up in price. So if I am a prudent leader, I am out looking for alternative sources. The administration wants us to believe that’s a positive, so [businesses] will start shopping in the U.S. But a thoughtful leader's already been canvasing the planet for the lowest cost of that product. There’s lots of reasons you buy things, and most businesses are to some degree always on the lookout for a cheaper, better way to do things. That’s standard business practice. Now, all of a sudden, there’s a new administration and we’re talking tariffs. Everybody is starting to look for alternatives. If those exist in the U.S., that company supplier may benefit from that. But you have to ask yourself, well, why wasn’t the customer in this case already buying American? There’s so much uncertainty. I know that anything I import or anything I buy from somebody who imported it, the price is going up. That’s facts. Now I’m scrambling [to] see what our alternatives are. If it’s a U.S. solution, I suspect that that solution is already more expensive than the import. If the import goes up by a lot, then all of a sudden I may have no choice but to buy American. I don’t mean that as a negative, but I have no choice but to buy a more expensive product made in America. Business people are not paid to be patriotic. They’re paid to be efficient. Businesses likely have been looking at their supply chains and potential impacts for months because of what Trump has said about tariffs. Should they consider these changes as fixes for now, or is this the beginning of a new world order? Absolutely we have a new world order. Anybody who’s looking at the model—the 70 years post World War II—that’s gone. Dead. And I don’t know that we [will] ever recover it. There’s no question that the old rules have changed. Covid started it, and this is now accelerating it. What should companies do? At the board level, it should be a holistic review of the business. What is our value add? If your value add is that you were nothing more than an importer, that business has changed dramatically. If your business is delivering value in other ways, it’s time to reevaluate. It’s a great wake up call. It’s frustrating, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but in a sense it could be incredibly healthy. The smart ones are going to say, ‘Hold on a second, why are we in business? What is it we’re delivering to our customers? What is that value? What do they value? What's the relationship like?’ It doesn’t have to be an eight-month study. Let’s have this discussion: Where are we crossing borders one way or the other? Exporting or importing? Where are we affected on the demand side? Are we shipping outside the U.S.? Are we importing raw material? Are we importing finished goods or equipment? How important is that to our value add? Should we even be in that part of the business? Can we even replace that? Is there a domestic solution that would get you out of that? What advice would you give business leaders looking forward to the next six months? Freeze for a second. Reevaluate some other best practices. Check in with your customers and find out how they’re doing because they may be struggling a bit, and that’s going to come back to you. I would definitely look at my supply chain, where I’m vulnerable both financially and [with] availability, because not having a product is always frustrating to your customers. I would be a bit more cautious on any project that’s got a lot of uncertainty inherent in it. It might just slow down a little bit. I want to protect my balance sheet. I want to protect my current employees. I hate to say this, but you might not hire that extra employee yet. Say to your employees, ‘We’re just being a bit more cautious. I know everyone’s stressed. We appreciate it. This is temporary. We’re not trying to kill you.’ It is time to laser focus in this period of uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty will turn into risk. Some of it will turn into opportunity. The weirdest part is that you may actually become a better business.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix) By DIDI TANG and ALEX VEIGAA Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.The transaction, which must be approved by Panama’s government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited. The deal gives them 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama’s government. In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports “give China ready observation posts” to take action. “This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,” Cruz said.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.Panama quit China’s Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio’s visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.But while much attention was focused on Trump’s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal.Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said.BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal.

Title: Big Tech Stocks Down Big as Wall Street Hit Hard in Wake of Trump’s Tariffs

Four of the five major tech companies represented at President Trump’s inauguration have seen their share prices decline in 2025, including Tesla, which has taken a 30% hit If, after seeing a who’s who of Silicon Valley executives at President Trump’s inauguration in January, you believed it was going to be the Year of Big Tech, you’d be wrong — at least so far. Instead, four of the five major tech companies represented at the inauguration — Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have seen their share prices take a noticeable hit to start 2025. Only Meta, who was represented by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has seen its share price climb this year. Here’s how those companies have performed on Wall Street since the start of the year, by mid-morning on Tuesday: — Meta: up 4.7% — Apple: down 1.9% — Amazon: down 9.6% — Alphabet: down 11.8% — Tesla: down 30% Tesla, as seen above, has been particularly hard-hit in 2025. CEO Elon Musk has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency for President Trump, as both are aiming to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal bureaucracy. Musk’s time spent away from his electric car company has upset some investors, who are calling for him to spend more time on Tesla and less time on DOGE. Reports of softening sales in China have not helped, either, although Tesla bulls are pointing to revamped models, the expansion of its self-driving technology and the launch of its $20,000 Optimus robots as reasons to be optimistic. From a macro standpoint, the market has taken a downturn recently, with many analysts saying the tariffs imposed by President Trump have been a key driver of the dip. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. The Wall Street slide for the major tech companies stands out, after Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos literally stood behind the president on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Many Trump fans who attended the inauguration told TheWrap they were skeptical of Big Tech’s sudden embrace of Trump, aside from Musk, whom the crowd overwhelmingly seemed to like. Now, it will be worth watching to see if investors remain skeptical of the market, or if they are “buying the dip” on these Big Tech stocks.

Title: The Uncomfortable Truth Behind Tesla’s Falling Stock Prices

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Elon Musk has become as much the face of Donald Trump’s presidency as Trump himself. Musk speaks at Cabinet meetings, sits down with Sean Hannity as Trump’s equal, and takes reporters’ questions from the Oval Office. He walks around like he owns the place, not wearing a suit—now a big deal, apparently!—and letting his son use him as a human jungle gym as he stands a few steps away from where Trump sits. Musk has garnered lots of attention for this power move. Some is positive. Most is not. Tesla, his biggest company, has become the subject of widespread boycotting calls by his and Trump’s opponents. There are frequent protests outside of Tesla showrooms. Barely a day passes without the viral egging of a Cybertruck. Tesla owners are getting international press attention for flipping their cars at a loss just to get rid of them. “I’m selling the Nazi mobile,” one dissatisfied driver says. The social internet might create an outsized impression of how common those acts of resistance are, but they still seem at least reflective of a shift. Public approval of Musk’s government obliteration really is low, and disapproval of Tesla itself is higher than ever. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock price is declining rapidly. Musk’s largest company lost 24 percent of its value in February. It was the stock’s second worst month ever, and then it fell another 3 percent on Monday, the first trading day of March. What a coincidence it would be if none of that had anything to do with the ever-growing, controversial public persona of its very famous chief executive. Big left-of-center social media accounts are celebrating their work: “Congrats, everyone—the Elon boycott is working!” a Bluesky post from a mysterious account with 800,000 followers reads. How much of that is wishful thinking by liberals desperate for a win, and how much is the anti-Musk resistance already notching wins? We know from recent history that Musk’s intense focus on non-Tesla projects can be a drag on Tesla’s stock. We also know that the stock can go back up rapidly without Musk dialing back his obnoxiousness or giving up his other projects. We do not know how much of the electric car company’s recent tanking owes to opposition to Musk personally and how much stems from Tesla’s wider business challenges, or how much those two things have to do with each other. In other words: Claiming that Tesla boycotts have hurt Musk any worse than a bee sting is speculative cope—but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The job, as Kobe Bryant once said, is not finished. People don’t fill out a questionnaire every time they sell Tesla stock, so we don’t know exactly what causes its price to go down. The evidence is strong, though, that Tesla shares trade down when the spotlight shines extra brightly on Musk paying attention to other things. Tesla’s stock began struggling more or less concurrently with Musk launching his bid for Twitter in the spring of 2022. The stock had a very bad year even compared to other American stocks, and Musk’s selling of Tesla shares (and an aborted plan to use Tesla shares as collateral for his bank loans) aggravated the situation. Musk is always very famous and always known to have lots of balls in the air, but he’s not usually as famous as he is right now. To the extent that Americans are aware of what his “government efficiency” initiative is up to, the polling says they are skeptical of it and of Musk specifically. A team of Wedbush Securities analysts, who are bullish on Tesla overall, put it this way in a Feb. 24 note to clients: “The worry of the Street is that Musk dedicating so much time (even more than we expected) to DOGE takes away from his time at Tesla in such a crucial moment and year for the company.” The investment firm thinks Tesla will manage through its Musk-related branding problems and its stock will rebound, but it calls a spade a spade. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and Trump alliance “clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand.” But there are problems with the idea that anti-Musk sentiment is driving Tesla into the ground. The stock had a miserable February but remains up nearly 40 percent over the past six months. Trump’s victory was a win for Tesla’s stock. The day after the election, investment research firm CFRA found that Tesla and Musk “are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump’s victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company’s autonomous driving technology.” Any gains the boycotters have made so far have not outweighed the benefit to Tesla’s stock from having its CEO more or less running the American government. After all, this self-serving domination of our politics is the very genesis of the protests. There is also the distinct possibility that Tesla’s stock just goes up anyway even if Musk never changes his behavior and liberals never bought a Tesla or rode in one when ordering an Uber again. Musk’s obsession with Twitter dragged the stock for a while, but then the car company’s stock shot up to market-beating heights in 2023 and 2024. It’s not as if Musk quieted down or became a less controversial public figure the past two years. Quite the opposite. Tesla’s biggest problems at the end of 2022 were not just about Musk’s reputation, but headwinds in the electric car market and broader economy. The company addressed those worries to Wall Street’s satisfaction, at least for a time. There’s a fair case that this time will be different, though. Musk is now very popular with Republicans, which would be better for Tesla if Republicans bought electric vehicles. But they don’t, perhaps because conservative media and politicians have spent years denigrating EVs whenever possible. Meanwhile, Democrats do buy electric vehicles but, I think it’s safe to say, will increasingly look for EV vendors who are not Elon Musk. Again, that would be less of a problem for Tesla if Republican adoration of Musk converted to more GOP voter enthusiasm for electric cars. “Could Elon Musk move that troublesome GOP needle?” asked Republican political operative Mike Murphy in a February report accompanying a new poll on the issue. “With his hostility to EV consumer subsidies, and the unwelcome market competition for Tesla that it helps create, the early answer is probably not. Elon seems focused on other things now and helping break down GOP hostility to EVs appears to be low on his priority list.” Tesla has other challenges elsewhere. Sales have been bad lately in Europe, where Musk has also done a bunch of political meddling. Increased Chinese competition for EV market share in that country was likely the biggest problem for Tesla’s stock two years ago, and the company is still losing ground there. The company underperformed in new car deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year, before DOGE existed or Musk cosplayed as Benito Mussolini on a podium on Inauguration Day. Federal regulators launched their latest probe into Tesla self-driving technology in the last few days of the Biden administration. Does the federal government still regulate Tesla in any serious way? Maybe not, but other countries reserve their rights to do so, and every news story with the words “investigation” and “self-driving” is bad press. This blend of events leaves the anti-Musk, anti-Tesla forces in a place of opportunity. While it’s a stretch to say that protests and boycott calls were responsible for all of the stock’s drop in February, or even most of it, it’s implausible that they’ve had no effect on investor confidence in the company. Musk is the face of Tesla, and he has polarized himself against the people who are most likely to buy his company’s primary product. That may not hurt Musk in the long run. He could find more customers elsewhere, or he could persuade huge swaths of Republicans that they are saving America by purchasing his electric cars. Moreover, even if huge numbers of people dislike Musk, many of them may not shun Tesla as a result. The link between disdain and action may not form, in the same way that people who don’t like slaughterhouses still eat steak. A recent observation by New York City–based climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis on Bluesky has stuck with me: “I went to the tesla protest for a thing I’m working on and I talked to several onlookers - not protesters - and asked them what they knew about Elon and Doge and I’m telling you people don’t know.” Creating that link in a collective mass of minds requires relentless news coverage and reaching millions of people who do not consume a lot of political news. Right now, people are showing up at Tesla locations and shaming Tesla car owners in an effort to build that attention. It might not be enough, but it’s a more effective and satisfying plan to counter Musk than anything that has so far emerged from most Democrats with power.

Title: FTC hit by layoffs in consumer protection & antitrust offices

DOGE, run by Elon Musk, has been primarily responsible for carrying out this task. Now, for the first time, the FTC has laid off workers from sections such as consumer protection and antitrust. As reported by The Verge, “at least” a dozen probationary staffers at the Federal Trade Commission were laid off last week. The layoffs affected both the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of Competition offices. Until now, the FTC had remained safe from government staff cuts. However, it seems that the measures have finally reached the organization. That said, the report mentions that they could not confirm that the layoffs are directly related to DOGE. Donald Trump authorized the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency after receiving Musk’s idea. Both believed that government organizations have way more employees than they actually need. So, DOGE is in charge of trying to solve that situation. Trump was convinced by the downsizing work Musk did at X (FKA Twitter). There have been recent layoffs at the FTC before, but these were not caused by DOGE either. The department affected at that time was the internal equal opportunity office. This was a result of the executive order signed by Donald Trump banning DEI programs in government organizations. Big tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have also followed this mandate. “DEI is over at the FTC,” said Republican Andrew Ferguson, FTC Chair, at the time. The National Treasury Employees are aware of the layoffs at the FTC. However, they do not know the real scope of the changes underway within the agency. Its website now includes a notice with the steps that the laid-off employees could take now. The Trump administration is also preparing a staff move at the FTC in Washington. They will now occupy the building formerly occupied by the dismantled USAID, Bloomberg reports. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: This Brutal Investment ‘Rule’ Will Clobber Your Returns In Trump 2.0

Feeling sad. getty There’s no doubt it’s been a rough couple weeks for stocks: Both the S&P 500 and the tech-focused NASDAQ have wiped out most of this year’s gains, as of this writing. The bigger decline among the NASDAQ, compared to the S&P 500, is notable here because the NASDAQ involves both higher risk and higher reward: With a heavier focus on tech stocks, it’s more volatile than the more diversified S&P 500. But it also reflects where many of the higher profit margins have been among U.S. firms. Hence, it has outrun the S&P 500 for a long time. With the big run-up we’ve seen in stocks, high valuations for both indexes and higher volatility, it’s fair to wonder if now is a good time to add to your holdings of stocks, or stock-focused closed-end funds. Diversification is, of course, the key to managing risk. That includes spreading our money across the world, across stocks in different sectors and across asset classes, including bonds, real estate investment trusts and preferred shares. It also includes, crucially, continually adjusting our allocation to stocks, bonds and other assets as our goals, age and risk tolerance change. That’s in contrast to one so-called “diversification” strategy we want to avoid like the plague, especially in times like these: sticking to the rigid “60/40 portfolio,” a tired “rule of thumb” that, as the name suggests, involves devoting 60% of your portfolio to stocks and 40% to bonds. This might sound familiar if you have a financial planner, as many stick to the 60/40 asset split. Even if you don’t, you might have gotten a recommendation to buy a fund like the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX). This fund has been around for nearly a century (its IPO was in 1929), and it has nearly a 60/40 allocation (closer to 67% and 33%, but no matter). Unfortunately, owning VWELX (in orange below) has resulted in a big lag in performance compared to the S&P 500 over the decades. 60/40 Lags Ycharts In more recent history, we’ve seen VWELX do poorly compared to the market along with other, newer funds with stricter 60/40 allocations, like the BlackRock 60/40 Target Allocation Fund (BIGPX). Its performance since 2007 (in purple below) has been worse than that of the Wellington fund (in blue). 60/40 Lags Ycharts What about times of extreme stress, like the 2022 crash? These periods are, after all, supposed to be what the 60/40 allocation is made for. Well, it didn’t exactly pan out that way: In this case, the S&P 500 (in orange below) recovered faster than 60/40—measured by BIGPX (in blue) and VWELX (in purple). In other words, this “conservative” rule didn’t protect investors much. 60/40 2022 Bear Market Ycharts Now here’s where the story takes an interesting turn. Because there have been times when the 60/40 portfolio has worked. Take the period following the dot-com bubble, when the Wellington fund (in orange below actually turned a profit while the S&P 500 (in purple) sagged. 60/40 Wins Once Ycharts But this doesn’t really happen anymore; not only did stocks recover faster than 60/40 in 2022, but following the subprime mortgage crisis, stocks recovered at about the same pace as a 60/40 did. This, again, shows that this “rule” worked in the past but, as of the early to mid-2000s, was no longer a realistic way to lower your risk. Why did the 60/40 allocation outperform the stock market back then and stop succeeding in the mid-2000s? One part of the answer comes down to regulation. In 2000, the SEC cracked down on analysts’ practice of giving sneak previews of research to top clients, which allowed big funds to front-run retail investors. They did this with a law called Regulation Fair Disclosure in 2000. Then, a settlement with bankers, analysts and regulators called the Global Research Analyst Settlement of 2003 restricted how well funds could use research to get ahead of other investors. Further tightening of regulations beyond these new rules also ensured that big investors’ advantages were reduced, if not scrapped altogether. This hurt the 60/40 strategy in one crucial way: It made the stock market more efficient. By ensuring information wasn’t selectively sent to big investors, the stock market instead began to go up more gradually and more directly, based on fundamentals. That, in turn, produced more reliable returns, helping attract more investors throughout the 2000s and 2010s, and lowering demand for bonds in the process. Again, these rule changes are just part of a bigger story. But they help explain why 60/40 is still a fixture in the financial planning-world, even though it began to lose its punch over 20 years ago.

This move, Conlan says, is likely to influence global regulatory approaches, encouraging other nations to explore similar initiatives and brining in a more structured environment for institutional participation. Paras Malhotra - SVP - Trade, Custody and Business Operations at CoinDCX,says the series of announcements by Trump, starting with the creation of a strategic crypto reserve, followed by the scheduled hosting of the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, has ‘truly energised the industry’. “The market’s reaction has been remarkable — ADA surged past $1, XRP reached $3, and Bitcoin crossed $92,000. In just 24 hours, nearly $315 million in Bitcoin shorts were liquidated, and over $330 billion flowed into the crypto markets,” he said. As US’ crypto push sets global precedent, Indian industry wants similar ‘progressive policies’ Trump’s digital asset reserve: How the US could shape the future of crypto While industry executives are upbeat around the developments in the US on cryptocurrency adoption, the prices of major cryptocurrencies have seen volatile movements. As at 18:08 IST, Bitcoin’s price is down 10 per cent at $83,497, while Ethereum was down 11 per cent at $2,091. Malhotra from CoinDCX says, institutional investors, particularly firms like BlackRock, have played a central role in sell-off, offloading significant amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The sell-off is being further compounded by macroeconomic factors, with the tariff war between the US and China intensifying, he said. User sentiment was also hit after major global crypto exchange Bybits saw a $1.4 billion hack, often touted as the biggest robbery in history. According to Ashish Singhal, co-founder at CoinSwitch, with creation of a strategic crypto reserve, we could be on the brink of a global crypto accumulation race — one that could push regulatory clarity forward and accelerate Web3 innovation. Singhal says with its deep pool of tech talent, entrepreneurial spirit, and thriving start-up ecosystem, India has everything it takes to lead the next wave of blockchain-driven transformation. “But to do so, we must act now — embracing progressive policies, fostering innovation, and positioning ourselves as a hub for decentralisation,” he said.

Title: Stocks fall in early trading as Trump tariffs take effect

The Trump administration's long-promised tariffs took hold on Tuesday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the Trump administration’s long-promised tariffs took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 670 points, or 1.5%; while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.3%. The policy taxes imports from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could raise prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones. Shares of retail giant Target fell 3% on Tuesday, following an earnings release from the company that cited "tariff uncertainty" as a potential impediment for the business. Walmart's stock price dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, while Amazon shares inched down 0.6%. Shares of Best Buy plummeted more than 13%. The sharp drop came after Best Buy CEO told analysts that price increases are "highly likely" as a result of the tariffs. Higher costs for car production could also pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Shares of Ford tumbled nearly 3% on Tuesday, while General Motors dropped about 4.5%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler -- saw shares decline more than 4%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, saw its stock price drop about 4.5%. The far-reaching losses extend a market slide that began on Monday afternoon when Trump affirmed plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs. Trump stuck to a March 4 start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The duties also raise input costs for manufacturers that import raw materials. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, the tariffs appeared to impact some of the other so-called "Magnificent Seven," a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, suffered a 2% drop in its stock price. Apple, which makes some of its products in China, fell nearly 1%. Shares of Microsoft defied the trend, however, remaining essentially unchanged on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia, which relies on semiconductors from Taiwan but also imports some materials from Mexico, saw shares increase about 1.5%. Alphabet's stock price climbed about 2%. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Crypto Market in Full Bear Mode After the $1.4B Bybit Hack. The Best Meme Coins to Lock in Now
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-as-lazarus-hackers-launder-1-4b-worth-of-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T14:24:58Z
Full Content:
On February 21, 2025, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus managed to steal approximately $1.5B worth of Ethereum. Despite the initial whiplash effect, the $1.5B Bybit hack could paradoxically boost the best meme coins in 2025 and beyond. Let’s dig into it. Subsequent investigations showed that the hackers used malware to display a fake UI to all signers. This could’ve only been achieved if the bad actors somehow infected each multisig signer’s device, suggesting that the hack was more complex than initially thought. The conclusion was that, in this particular case, the weakest link was probably the human element rather than Bybit’s security profile. So, why is crypto so down today, so long after the hack? According to EmberCN, the hackers managed to launder the entire $1.4B (499,000 ETH), causing ETH’s price to drop 23% following the event. Today, Bitcoin’s chart tells a sad story after falling to below 83K. Indeed, the whole crypto market seems to have collapsed, with even the best altcoins joining the bear movement. The Bybit hack didn’t impact cryptos alone. DeFi exchanges suffered, too. Chainflip, in particular, as the hackers started funneling the stolen assets through its platform mere hours after the breach. Chainflip, to its credit, identified the suspicious activity and took action immediately. The hackers also used THORChain, another high-profile DeFi service, to swap over $742M shortly after the event. Unlike Chainflip, which has a central authority, Thorchain is regulated by a network of validators, making it more difficult to implement any time-sensitive measures. The THORChain network recorded massive trading volumes following the hack, reaching an all-time record of $859.61M on February 26. This caused $RUNE, the official THORChain token, to surge by up to 33% between February 21 and February 26. In the spirit of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’, both Chainflip and THORChain were heavily criticized by the community for how they handled things. Chainflip took the most heat, with many arguing that disabling swaps goes against the platform’s commitment to decentralization. At the opposite poll is THORChain, criticized for not taking action. So, where does this leave us? The crypto market is slowly recovering, but it’s still not out of the bear-infested woods. Even so, some see this as the best time to invest in new crypto projects in preparation for the next bull run. Especially, given the SEC’s upcoming series of roundtables on crypto security and regulation could turn the trend around. The following are some of the most promising meme coins to buy while the market is down. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme project tied to Bitcoin’s market performance. The ongoing presale has raised over $3.1M with a token price of $0.00239. BTC Bull has several mechanisms to support its long-term development: Stakers also enjoy a 135% APY with a dynamic reward rate (it self-adjusts based on the number of stakers, and the later you start staking, the smaller the APY you receive). The project shows long-term promise as it rewards hodlers specifically and evaluates alongside Bitcoin. The tokenomics data looks solid, and the project’s whitepaper does a good job of detailing the BTC Bull vision. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an advanced AI entity designed to spur on the crypto conversation and mine the chatter for trading cues. The self-evolving and self-sovereign AI agent interacts with people on X and Telegram and offers predictions and insights into the most promising crypto trends. The roadmap hints at great things to come, with the final stage allowing MIND of Pepe to create and advertise its own tokens. $MIND holders will gain exclusive insights into these projects so that they can tune in early to maximize their profits. The presale has raised over $7M with a $MIND valued at $0.0034402. MIND of Pepe currently rewards stakers with a 321% APY and a dynamic reward rate, so the earlier you invest, the higher the post-launch ROI. Dogecoin ($DOGE) started as a joke in 2013 and quickly became a crypto sensation. While the project has no real-life utility, its fired-up fanbase gave it one; to take Doge to the moon. They evidently succeeded, as today, Dogecoin is a top cryptocurrency with the 9th largest market cap. You can spend $DOGE in over 2.5K online stores to purchase anything from clothing and software to domains and private jets.$DOGE currently sits at $0.1939 after it gained 19% over the past year. The coin lost around 11.6% of its value in charts over the past 24 hours but appears to be in a consolidation phase, which could be the sign investors were looking for. Now that we’ve answered the question of the day, ‘Why is crypto crashing?’, let’s look to the future. Coindesk reported on March 1 that the crypto market may be showing the first signs of recovery, with Bitcoin moving slightly past $84K. This assessment tends to be supported by the Fear and Greed Index, with Bitcoin’s price sitting above the community’s pessimistic predictions. This positive outlook also comes in the context of BlackRock finally adding Bitcoin EFT to its $150B portfolio. This supports the trend of wider crypto institutional adoption, which could be another trigger for the next bullish wave. For this reason, the best meme coins, especially ones like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that are still in presale, are looking more appealing by the day. Don’t take this as financial advice. Always DYOR and invest responsibly, as the crypto market is always risky and volatile. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-kiss-of-death-arthur-hayes-recession/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T14:00:05Z
Full Content:
In his latest blog post, titled “KISS of Death,” former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes outlines a provocative thesis on the trajectory of Bitcoin and broader financial markets under the renewed presidency of Donald Trump. Hayes—who has long held bullish views on crypto—argues that a convergence of fiscal and monetary policies could catapult Bitcoin’s price to as high as $1 million during the Trump 2.0 era, but only after a period of recession-driven turmoil. Hayes’s framework revolves around the “KISS” principle—Keep It Simple, Stupid—urging market participants to stay focused on the core driver of asset prices: liquidity. Rather than overreacting to sensational headlines, he contends that one should watch for shifts in the quantity and price of money (i.e., how much credit is created and at what interest rate). “One day, you buy and then quickly sell after digesting the next headline,” Hayes warns. “The market chops you in the process, and your stack quickly diminishes.” He recommends sticking to a simpler outlook: If the U.S. government prints significant amounts of money at lower rates, risk assets like Bitcoin can surge. A key premise of Hayes’s analysis is that President Trump, a “real estate showman” by background, will debt finance his “America First” agenda rather than embrace austerity. Hayes contrasts Trump with Andrew Mellon—Treasury Secretary under Herbert Hoover—who once allegedly declared: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system.” Hayes argues that such a stance would be political suicide for a president seeking to be viewed as the 21st-century Franklin D. Roosevelt rather than Hoover. As Hayes puts it, “Trump wants to be considered the greatest President ever” and is therefore inclined to loosen credit conditions rather than tighten them. Hayes highlights Trump’s unconventional maneuver to slash federal spending and potentially trigger a recession, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to respond with rate cuts and fresh liquidity. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneur Elon Musk, is portrayed as an aggressive effort to expose fraud and reduce waste in government programs. Hayes cites DOGE’s claims that Social Security payments may be going out to deceased individuals or unverified identities, supposedly costing hundreds of billions—or even a trillion—dollars a year. “Trump and DOGE are firing hundreds of thousands of government employees,” Hayes notes, referencing media reports citing elevated jobless claims in the Washington, D.C., area. By cutting federal budgets so drastically and so quickly, Trump could—in Hayes’s words—“cause a recession or convince the market that one is right around the corner.” Once signs of recession appear, Hayes predicts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will have little choice but to cut rates, end quantitative tightening (QT), and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to avert a widespread financial crisis. Powell, whom Hayes dubs a “turncoat traitor” (a reference to the Fed’s past rate cut during Kamala Harris’s campaign), is nonetheless bound by the Fed’s mandate to maintain economic stability. Hayes points to $2.08 trillion in US corporate debt and $10 trillion in US Treasury debt that must roll over in 2025. If the economy slows, rolling that debt over at high interest rates becomes unfeasible. In that scenario, the Fed’s only salvation is fresh money creation and lower rates. Hayes calculates that a full Fed response—encompassing several policy shifts—could result in as much as $2.74 to $3.24 trillion in new liquidity: Dropping the Federal Funds Rate from 4.25% to 0% could be equivalent to roughly $1.7 trillion of money printing, according to Hayes’s estimates. Currently, the Fed conducts $60 billion per month in QT. If QT ends by April 2025, Hayes sees a $540 billion liquidity injection relative to prior expectations. Additional Treasury purchases by the Fed or US commercial banks (the latter aided by a relaxation of the Supplemental Leverage Ratio) might add another $500 billion to $1 trillion in dollar credit. He compares this to the $4 trillion in stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that Bitcoin jumped roughly 24x from its 2020 lows to 2021 highs in response to that liquidity wave, Hayes says even a more conservative 10x multiple could be in play. “For those who ask how we get to $1 million in Bitcoin during the Trump presidency, this is how,” he proclaims, linking massive credit creation with a sharply higher BTC price. Despite his bullish long-term forecast, Hayes believes Bitcoin’s immediate outlook may be rocky. Hayes sees potential for Bitcoin to revisit the $70,000 to $80,000 range in the short-term—levels that are markedly above the prior cycle’s all-time high but still below the current market. “If Bitcoin leads the market on the downside, it will also do so on the upside,” Hayes writes, positing that BTC often bottoms out before traditional equities. He cites the significant run-up to $110,000 around mid-January (Trump’s inauguration timeline) followed by a pullback to $78,000 in late February. “Bitcoin is screaming that a liquidity crisis is nigh, even though the U.S. stock market indices are still near their all-time highs,” he notes. “I firmly believe we are still in a bull cycle, and as such, the bottom at worst will be the previous cycle’s all-time high of $70,000,” Hayes says, underscoring his conviction that any major dips are opportunities to accumulate rather than panic-sell. In Hayes’s view, the “Kiss of Death” is not about Bitcoin’s demise but about the outdated fiat system struggling to contain spiraling debt loads and political brinkmanship. He argues that the short-term chaos in traditional markets—triggered by DOGE-driven spending cuts and a hesitant Fed—will ultimately pave the way for a new round of monetary expansion. The bottom line? Hayes insists that staying focused on liquidity is the best strategy: “Let politicians do politician things, stay in your lane, and buy Bitcoin.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,725.

Title: Wall Street's hottest trade is coming to retail investors. Here's why experts are warning about buying into private credit.

It's a tricky time to be an investor. The anticipated Trump Bump is turning into a tariff meltdown, and Big Tech appears to no longer be driving the S&P 500. In this uncertain environment, alternatives like private credit offer promising returns for investors. And it's easier than ever to put money into the asset class as institutions race to democratize the asset. Apollo and State Street just launched the SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV). But before you rush to add private credit to your portfolio, some wealth managers recommend proceeding with caution. While private credit can be a lucrative investment, it's not the best fit for everyone. Private credit started getting hot after the 2008 financial crisis. As banks reduced risky lending activity in the face of increased regulation, businesses began seeking loans from non-bank lenders. Private credit loans are typically made to middle-market companies for three to seven years and can yield double-digit annualized returns. They also have low correlation with public markets and provide regular income through interest payments. Because of these characteristics, institutional investors have piled in and supercharged the asset class. The private credit market is currently worth around $2 trillion, with the potential to hit $3.5 trillion by 2028, according to BlackRock. To continue on this trajectory, asset managers are looking to expand their customer base and make the asset class more available to everyday investors, Brian Payne, chief private markets and alternatives strategist at BCA research, told Business Insider. "It's more assets to manage, more fee dollars," Payne said. The pool of traditional buyers, such as insurance companies and asset managers, has shrunk, so originators are looking for new customers, according to Payne. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, agrees. "Private credit managers now see a huge opportunity within individuals and they're going to go after it and create vehicles attractive to individual investors," he said. Among individuals, the ultra-wealthy have been leading the charge in tapping into the private credit market. Because of the illiquid nature and high fees associated with private credit, the investments have traditionally been more suited to more sophisticated investors with large amounts of capital to deploy. For example, a high net-worth individual with $20 million in liquid assets might allocate half of their wealth to equities and split the remainder between fixed income, private credit, and other alternatives, said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement. Yoshioka also pointed out that alternative investments do come with higher fees than traditional public investments, so investors interested in the space should make note of that. The State Street and Apollo ETF charges a 70 basis-point fee. For comparison, the iShares 1-10 Year Laddered Corporate Bond Index ETF has an expense ratio of 28 basis points. Democratizing private credit with more retail-accessible channels like an ETF means that investors no longer need millions to participate. But Ablin isn't so sure that ETFs are the best way to get exposure to private credit. "When your ultimate asset is illiquid, it's really difficult to create liquid access to it without diluting what you're trying to do. If you're going to create an ETF of these things, chances are you're going to have to supplement it with publicly traded income vehicles and cash to make sure you can meet the daily redemption requirements your fundholders have," Ablin said. ETFs can be traded during market hours, but traditional private credit funds often involve a lock-up period of several years, which is why private credit offers an illiquidity premium. To Ablin, those two assets seem antithetical. State Street and Apollo's private credit ETF contains 80% investment-grade debt securities, up to 20% of non-investment grade securities, and up to 15% of assets in private funds. The liquidity is backed by a contractual agreement with Apollo to provide executable bids on Apollo-backed assets in the fund. The ETF "raises potential risks arising from reliance on Apollo's ability to purchase securities from PRIV, and the reliance on Apollo's market making to set the pricing for these trades," Neal Epstein, vice president of private credit at Moody's Ratings, commented. Don't just take it from wealth managers. The SEC is concerned about the structure of the State Street/Apollo fund as well and has sent a letter requesting more information from the firms "We have concerns regarding the Fund's liquidity risk management program," the SEC wrote last Thursday. The SEC also flagged that including "Apollo" in the fund name could be misleading, as Apollo isn't obligated to sell debt to the fund. The fund responded that it "will review and, if necessary, revise the registration statement disclosure to ensure that it is consistent with the above representation" and change the fund name "as soon as practicable."

Title: Nvidia, Tesla, Target, Chipotle, and Super Micro Computer: Stocks to watch today

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%. The S&P 500, which had its worst day of the year on Monday, dropped 1.2%. Here are stocks to watch on Tuesday. Best Buy (BBY+0.72%) stock dropped after the electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. However, CEO Corie Barry indicated that prices for U.S. consumers are likely to increase due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG+0.41%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados, with 50% of its supply coming from Mexico. As tariffs on imports from Mexico take effect, investors are worried about the potential impact on the company. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA+0.85% stock fell as concerns mounted over AI-related spending and the impact of new tariffs. The chip manufacturer seems to be cautious about limitations on the export of AI chips. Nvidia stock plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.10%, a key player in AI hardware, also declined in the morning, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. However, the stock recovered in the afternoon by gaining 10%. Shares of Target (TGT-0.94%) were down as it beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $30.92 billion, about $2.41 earnings per share. But Target said it expects a “meaningful” decline in first-quarter profits compared to the same period last year. The cautious outlook stems from “ongoing consumer uncertainty,” weaker sales in February, and mounting concerns over the impact of tariffs. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China — which together accounted for almost 42% of total imports in 2024 — went into effect early Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA+0.93% stock declined due to rising fears about tariffs among investors. It is likely that the new tariff will raise car prices. Moreover, a day after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised the price target, Bank of America reduced its price target for the stock from $490 to $380 while maintaining a Neutral rating.

Title: Ray-Ban and Meta just teased new limited-edition smart glasses – but they'll be in frustratingly short supply

Ray-Ban and Meta have another 3,600 pairs of clear specs on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has announced that new “limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta glasses” are set to land this month, with promo images suggesting they’ll be transparent just like the previous limited-edition design it launched – but expect them to be even harder to get your hands on. Beyond a look at the Ray-Ban logo on a clear-ish frame that shows off the hardware inside the smart specs, we know relatively little about the design. The previous clear frames used the Wayfarer frame type, but this new run could get the Skyler or Headliner design, which have more rounded lenses, although our money is on a bold new design like the frames A$AP Rocky – Ray-Ban’s new Creative Director – just unveiled at Milan Fashion Week – which would tally with the “straight from the runway” comment in Meta’s promotional material for the new limited-edition specs. We also don’t know if these specs will come with the same limited-edition black case as the previous edition, instead of the standard brown, though we hope they do. Adding to the list of unknown is that Meta has yet to reveal a price. Given that the previous limited model cost $429 – which is about $100 more than the standard translucent frames – we expect this new design will also be pricier than standard Ray-Ban smart glasses, and perhaps even pricier than the previous limited design. We say that because while Meta’s last limited run consisted of 7,500 pairs, this time it’s only making 3,600 – at least, that’s what '0001/3600' printed on the frames in the promo image on its website is suggesting. Given the even more limited supply, Meta may choose to bump the price up, so if you’re keen to pick up a pair for yourself you’ll want to act fast when they drop. There's no precise release date to mark on your calendars, though there is a 'Notify me' button on the website if you want to get an update when the glasses go live –just be prepared to go home empty handed. Scalpers are showing that they’re still in full force in 2025 by ruining limited drops for tech, and there’s a good chance they’ll strike again here. There may also be scammers around looking to take advantage of the hype if stock does run dry – so be careful buying glasses claiming to be the limited edition Ray-Bans from unofficial stores and resellers.

Title: USA Imposes New Tariffs On Canada, Mexico & China, Including On Comics
URL: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/usa-imposes-new-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-including-on-comics/

Posted in: Comics, Comics Publishers, Current News, DC Comics, Fantagraphics, Marvel Comics, Vault | Tagged: canada, tariffs The USA imposes new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, and yes, that includes the printing, distribution and selling of comic books. Since American President Donald Trump paused the threatened taxes and tariffs against American importers of Canadian and Mexican goods earlier in the year, and importers from China got away with just a 10% tariff, the fact that this was a delay rather than a cessation was an inconvenient truth that many tried to dismiss. Tariffs weren't mentioned much at the recent ComicsPRO retailer summit. Surely a deal could be done in time? But today, it is no longer impossible to ignore the fact that the USA imposed 25% tariffs across the board against Canada and Mexico and increased the China tariff to 20%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a retaliatory statement saying that "Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered. Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods – starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days' time. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures. While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal. Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term." China has imposed a 15 per cent tariff on imported chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while a 10 per cent tariff will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. According to the US Department of Agriculture, China accounted for 17 percent of American agricultural exports in 2023. Beijing also placed 25 American firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds. Most comic books read in America are printed in Canada, close to the paper mill logging forests, and most large collections are printed in China. In January, Gina Gagliano at the Comics Journal cited many publishers on the issues they are facing regarding taxes and tariffs at the border. Eric Reynolds, VP and Associate Publisher at Fantagraphics, said, "Even if we could find printers domestically who could do a lot of the higher-end, hardcover visual art books that we do, they would cost roughly twice as much or more as the same book would cost to print overseas, our options in terms of paper and printing/binding would be limited, and the quality would likely suffer as well… I read somewhere that there hasn't been a new paper mill built in the U.S. in something like 35 years and that the number of existing paper mills is a small fraction of U.S. printing's 20th-century heyday." Avi Ehrlich, the publisher of Silver Sprocket, said, "The decision to print overseas isn't just about cost (though they are cheaper), but really about quality and options. We haven't been able to find domestic printers able to offer the quality and options available from printers overseas, such as the high quality interesting paper stocks, binding options, and unique foils that make our books stand out. We used to print primarily in Canada and finally moved most of our printing overseas after a series of very frustrating quality issues and delays due to North American printers simply not having all of the resources available under one roof to efficiently and correctly make books with the quality we want to be producing." Josh O'Neill, publisher of Beehive Books, said, "I just know for our odd business, there's no manufacturing capacity to do books like these in America, and that capacity could not be easily rebuilt. It's less about labor costs than the machines and expertise just not existing to do high end book publishing. Printing overseas is often quicker than domestically, even with the long shipping times, because printing domestically often means one printer handling the covers, another handling a special cover effect, and a third printing the text block (inside pages), which introduces so many extra opportunities for mistakes and delays as the project is moved between different printers." Leyla Aker, Director of Publishing at Square Enix Manga and Books, said, "Aside from tariffs on finished books printed in other countries, the other area of concern would be tariffs on paper, which would have the potential to affect titles printed in the U.S. as well." And Damien Wassel, Publisher of Vault Comics, said "While this environment may benefit American printers, it will harm smaller American publishers disproportionately in relation to larger publishers. Print costs are extremely scale sensitive. Publishers who are producing work with larger print runs will still be able to find margin without making significant changes to their publishing operations or strategies. Smaller publishers simply will not have that luxury." When the plans were initially announced, Bleeding Cool looked at the likely impact on monthly superhero comics, and those issues haven't gone away. They are expected to have a greater impact on DC Comics than Marvel, as DC is more likely to print in Canada, though both have long-term printing contracts. We also looked at how Bad Idea Comics' recent Hank Howard Pizza Detective campaign could result in a two hundred thousand loss for the publisher due to the tariffs. Alien Books' Matias Timarchi told us that the tariffs were likely going to lead to an increase in the price of single-issue comic books by at least a dollar. and that this could be the end of the $4.99 comic book and that they had changed everything about their plans to relaunch the Valiant Universe. However, Bleeding Cool also got the scoop that Transcontinental Inc., the biggest comic book printer in North America, based across Canada, has made the move to cover the cost of tariffs on the comics they print for ninety days after the tariffs have been imposed. That effectively puts a three-month delay on the impact these taxes and tariffs are going to have on comic book publishers such as DC Comics, Marvel, Image and many much smaller companies while taking a massive whack in the process. It is not an exaggeration to say that Transcontinental may have just saved a number of comic publishers and comic book stores from going bust with one move. Now, obviously, not even a printer as big as Transcontinental Inc. can indefinitely subsidise the American comic book market. But three months may be enough to keep the plates spinning until a more permanent solution can be found—or at least a less temporary one. The US stock market fell significantly after – even during – the announcement. But not everyone sees the impact of tariffs so badly. Comic book retailer Regan Clem of Summit Comics & Games in Michigan has a different take from wider picture, citing stories from Reuters saying "Honda to produce next Civic in Indiana, not Mexico, due to US tariffs" and from the AP "Apple announces $500 billion investment in US amid tariff threats", stating "I don't think these stories are getting any attention. Bringing jobs to American workers is caring about the working class" and adding "I'm old enough to remember when Democrats were for tariffs and protecting American jobs." However, Eric Reynolds of Fantagraphics states, "I wish there was an infrastructure here that tariffs would kickstart, but there just isn't. It's not like there are paper mills and printing presses just waiting to have the lights turned back on. Even if the tariffs spurred a long-term investment in paper and printing, with new mills and presses being built, it would take years, and a lot of publishers may well go out of business before that bears fruit. It could be quite disastrous." Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Establish Joint Venture for European Satellite Mobile Services

SatCo aims to deliver seamless satellite-based mobile broadband services to mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe, ensuring full geographic coverage. The new entity will exclusively distribute AST SpaceMobile's satellite capabilities through a comprehensive service offering that includes network management and operations, all managed from a European-based center leveraging Vodafone's engineering expertise. As part of its operations, SatCo will establish a network of ground stations to provide backhaul connectivity between MNOs and AST SpaceMobile's low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network. This initiative is expected to bolster European digital sovereignty, as AST SpaceMobile's satellites function as remote radio heads while core network control remains with each respective MNO. Under Vodafone's co-ownership, SatCo will further enhance this sovereignty with its own backhaul capabilities and European-based leadership. "Vodafone's space-based mobile broadband will mean our customers can stay connected, wherever they are. Our new satellite company will be able to offer this pioneering technology to other European mobile operators through a turnkey service that combines Vodafone's leading network and engineering with AST SpaceMobile's 'antennas in the sky,'" said Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group CEO. Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile, added, "Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality." On January 27, 2025, Vodafone successfully conducted the world's first space-based mobile video call using its newly launched BlueBird satellites, demonstrating its commitment to providing uninterrupted mobile coverage for its 340 million customers across 15 countries, as well as its network partners operating in 45 additional markets. Vodafone plans to launch commercial space-based mobile broadband services across Europe in 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's unique satellite technology will enable direct mobile broadband connectivity to standard 4G and 5G smartphones without requiring software updates or specialized devices, seamlessly integrating with Vodafone's terrestrial networks. Satellite connectivity will serve as a crucial supplement to existing mobile and fixed infrastructure, ensuring continuous coverage in remote locations such as mountainous regions and offshore areas while also enhancing network resilience across Europe. In addition, Vodafone, AST SpaceMobile, and the University of Malaga have collaborated to establish a new space and terrestrial mobile broadband research and validation hub. Supported by the Spanish Space Agency, the facility will be based at Vodafone's Innovation Centre in Malaga and is set to commence operations by summer 2025. This hub will focus on developing integrated LEO satellite and terrestrial broadband solutions. Further expanding its European footprint, AST SpaceMobile has also inaugurated a 5,600-square-meter manufacturing and office facility in Barcelona, aimed at boosting production capacity and advancing the testing of its satellite and telecom technologies.

Title: Trump’s energy secretary pushed legal attack on green investing

Say you’re an American worker with a retirement plan. Out of concern for the planet — or how wildfires, heat waves, and hurricanes might affect your portfolio — you want the company managing your money to consider the environment in deciding where to invest. If one of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet secretaries gets his way, you might not have much choice. Chris Wright, recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of energy, has been aiming to dismantle a U.S. Department of Labor rule that governs 401(k)s and other private retirement plans for more than 150 million people. The regulation allows asset managers to weigh environmental, social, and governance — or ESG — factors as long as they financially benefit retirees. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Wright was CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy in 2023 when the company and about two dozen states sued the agency to overturn the rule. Liberty’s case was dismissed in February by a federal judge in Texas, but the battle over ESG finance may be just beginning. The fossil fuel industry and its allies have launched a multipronged assault against sustainable investing, suing asset managers and pension funds and federal regulatory agencies that oversee them. ESG investing can illegally put political ideology over the financial interests of retirees, they argue in lawsuits. The conservative policy guide Project 2025 has called for the Trump administration to overturn current rules and prohibit ESG for most retirement plans. With roughly $14 trillion held in private retirement funds alone, their approach to investing has high stakes not only for individual retirees but also for the oil and gas industries. In January, an investigation by The Examination found the fossil fuel industry taking advantage of sustainable finance. More than $286 billion in a lax form of green finance called sustainability-linked loans were made to companies in polluting industries — from oil and gas to mining and timber — the investigation, published in partnership with Mississippi Today and the Toronto Star, revealed. This money was often counted by banks toward their sustainable investing targets, even though in some cases companies expanded polluting activities and increased their carbon emissions while they benefited from the loans. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How But in the months since Trump’s election, fear of political fallout and legal attacks on sustainable investing have prompted many financial institutions to abandon ESG goals altogether. In January, Texas federal Judge Reed O’Connor ruled against American Airlines in a case alleging that the airline’s 401(k) investments with BlackRock violated its duty to retirees because BlackRock considered ESG criteria in its investments and American failed to keep its own corporate interests separate from its obligations to retirement investors. Around the same time, BlackRock dropped out of the Net Zero Asset Managers, an industry group dedicated to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. BlackRock joined an array of leading U.S. and Canadian banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs, that recently withdrew from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. In a video appearance on February 17, Wright denounced net-zero targets as “sinister” and said they are being used to “shrink human freedom.” Lisa Sachs, director of the Center on Sustainable Investment at Columbia University, said efforts to ban ESG policies seek to help the fossil fuel industry at the expense of retirees. Prohibiting ESG factors from retirement plans would put blinders on asset managers, she said, forcing them to ignore real financial risks, such as floods affecting real estate value. This would undermine their ability to make safe long-term investments for pensioners, she said. “This is the exact opposite of free-market ideology,” Sachs said. Much of the legal dispute revolves around how ESG investing is defined — and experts agree the term is vague and easily manipulated. An ESG investment fund is one that takes environmental and social risks into account in its decision-making, not necessarily one that invests for social purposes, Sachs said. She cites Coca-Cola as a company that has a high ESG rating because assessors have deemed it does a good job managing the environmental and social risks to its business, even though its product contributes to obesity and chronic disease worldwide. Financial companies have misrepresented how ESG considerations are most often used, Sachs said, calling the marketing a form of greenwashing. Sachs said it is largely these misrepresentations that have put ESG policies in the crosshairs. “The greenwashing is what led to the political backlash,” she said. Jonathan Berry, the attorney for Liberty Energy in its suit against the labor department, said Liberty’s challenge doesn’t object to asset managers considering environmental factors when they are financially material. Instead, the company opposes a “tiebreaker” provision in the rule that allows asset managers to weigh non-financial ESG factors when deciding between investments that are economically equal. “It cracks open the door for divided loyalties,” Berry said. Berry is also one of the authors of Project 2025, the policy playbook whose proposals have been reflected in many of the Trump administration’s early actions. Among Project 2025’s prescriptions: removing ESG considerations from private retirement plans and a similar plan for federal employees, as well as possible enforcement actions against asset managers that have ESG policies while managing federal retirement plans. But not all conservatives are on board. Some Project 2025 contributors argue in an “alternative view” section that these recommendations go too far and that workers should be able to decide on investments in their retirement plans for themselves. “Even though ESG investing is often not a sound financial strategy, it is not wrong for retirement plans to offer ESG investment options,” the dissenters write. Berry agreed that the term ESG is “deliberately elastic.” But he said it often works the other way around: ESG investing is defined as considering environmental risks to get a foot in the door, and then used to push for political goals like divesting from fossil fuels. In 2023, conservative groups sued New York City pension funds that divested from fossil fuels, alleging the funds had breached their duties to retirees; that case was dismissed last year. In February, the campaign against ESG suffered another setback. Matthew Kacsmaryk, a conservative federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump, dismissed Liberty Energy’s lawsuit seeking to overturn the labor department’s ESG rule. Liberty’s argument that the department cannot apply ESG factors when deciding between financially equal plans, he ruled, would require it to choose based on “arbitrary randomness” instead. The ruling means that if the Trump administration wants to restrict financial options and prohibit ESG considerations from the retirement plans of the majority of American workers, it will likely have to act on its own, through the labor department. Dan Terpstra, a retired supercomputer scientist at the University of Tennessee, has been careful over the years to ensure his retirement funds are not invested in fossil fuels. An active member of the Presbyterian Church and an advocate for sustainable investing, Terpstra worries that a crackdown on ESG policies would be “forcing us away from doing the right thing.” The prospect of banning such plans, he said, would be “an erosion of our personal freedoms in service of a vision of America that I barely recognize.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Should You Buy AMZN Stock At $205?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/04/should-you-buy-amazon-stock-despite-its-high-valuation/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. Web Summit attendees visit the Amazon Pavilion on the second day of the Web Summit in Doha, Qatar, ... [+] on February 24, 2025. (Photo by Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 3, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff confirmation, which resulted in the Dow Jones falling 1.8% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.1%, marking its worst day of the year to date. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. At its current levels of $205, AMZN stock looks attractive but volatile — making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AMZN stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AMZN stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Amazon.com along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. • Amazon.com has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.0 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 41.4 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.3 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Amazon.com’s Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. • Amazon.com has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 14.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 11.9% from $554 billion to $620 billion in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 11.0% to $159 billion in the most recent quarter from $143 billion a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Amazon.com’s profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Amazon.com’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $61 billion, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 9.8% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Amazon.com’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $113 billion, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Amazon.com's balance sheet looks strong. • Amazon.com’s Debt figure was $135 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $2.2 trillion (as of March 3, 2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 5.4% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $101 billion of the $625 billion in Total Assets for Amazon.com. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 15.1% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AMZN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AMZN stock fell 52.0% from a high of $170.40 on 3 January 2022 to $81.82 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by Feb. 2, 2024. • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $242.06 on Feb. 4, 2025, and currently trades at around $205. • AMZN stock fell 22.7% from a high of $108.51 on 19 February 2020 to $83.83 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by April 14, 2020. • AMZN stock fell 65.3% from a high of $5.04 on Oct. 23, 2007, to $1.75 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500. • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by Oct. 23, 2009. In summary, Amazon.com's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Very Strong • Profitability: Neutral • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Strong Hence, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AMZN is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AMZN stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Flowdesk has secured $102 million in fresh funding to expand its digital asset trading and liquidity business, backed by HV Capital and a debt facility from BlackRock-managed funds. “This funding round marks a pivotal moment for Flowdesk as we accelerate our expansion into key global markets,” said CEO Guilhem Chaumont in an email to CoinDesk. “Institutional demand for market-making infrastructure is growing rapidly, and we are committed to scaling our technology and services to meet that need.” In a release, Flowdesk said it will use the proceeds of the round to scale its over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives business and launch a dedicated crypto credit desk while also doubling headcount at the trading firm. "Flowdesk has built one of the most robust global infrastructures for digital asset trading, with unparalleled market connectivity, regulatory coverage, and a broad range of liquidity solutions," Chaumont continued. It also plans to expand into the Middle East, with the UAE being the next potential hub. Flowdesk is known for making bold bets when opening new offices; it expanded to the U.S. during the height of the Biden White House's war on crypto, a move that seemed risky at the time but ended up paying off handsomely for the company. Tokenization is also a major focus for Flowdesk as institutional interest in on-chain assets grows. The company has worked with token issuers to facilitate liquidity for tokenized assets and plans to expand its services to include stablecoins, tokenized securities, and money market funds. "From day one, Flowdesk has been built on the vision that tokenization would redefine financial markets. Over the past years, our work with token issuers has positioned us at the forefront of this transformation," Chaumont said in an email. Flowdesk's existing investors, Eurazeo, Cathay Innovation, and ISAI, also participated in the round. Sam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

Title: Caelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt head-to-head: Two outstanding number eights set to battle it out
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/04/caelan-doris-v-gregory-alldritt-head-to-head-two-outstanding-number-eights-set-to-battle-it-out/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Born: Ballina, Mayo. April 2nd, 1998 (age 26). Caps: 49 (9 tries). Position: Number eight. Height: 1.93m (6ft 4in) Weight: 111kg (245lb; 17st 7lb) Did you know? Educated in Blackrock College, while growing up in Lacken, Co Mayo. Doris’s father, Chris, was an artist in residence at Mayo County Council, who once spent 40 days at the top of Croagh Patrick interviewing pilgrims as part of a ‘social sculpture’. Though a true-blue Leinster rugby man, Doris supports Mayo in Gaelic football. Has a degree in psychology. Strengths: His carrying and tackling numbers are invariably among the highest and, with his footwork, among the most dynamic too, and he usually has big, match-influencing moments. Many strings to his bow, he times his poaches effectively and not many backs could have made that pass for Garry Ringrose’s try two years ago. His presence this Saturday is vital. He also benefits from the Irish system. A year younger than Alldritt, Doris has played 140 games for province and country (48 less than Alldritt), and this season he has accumulated markedly less minutes (1,031) in 14 games. Doris has quickly embraced captaincy too. A truly exceptional rugby player. Born: Toulouse, 23rd March 1997 (age 27). Caps: 54 (6 tries). Position: Number eight. Height: 1.91m (6ft 3in) Weight: 115kg (254lb; 18st 2lb). Did you know? Alldritt’s father, Terence, moved to Stirling in Scotland aged 12 after being born in Kenya and attending boarding school in South Africa. Alldritt regularly visited Scotland as a child and his brother, Scott, has played for Stewart’s Melville in Edinburgh. Strengths: Natural born leader who has captained La Rochelle in all their clashes with Leinster and, fuelled by Ronan O’Gara, has evidently built up some antipathy towards Irish teams. He actually has a winning record against Leinster, having scored a key try in the semi-final win in an empty Stade Deflandre in the 2021 semi-final, while he was a key absentee when Leinster won on a sodden day in La Rochelle last season. Even the indefatigable Alldritt had to take a post-World Cup break. He invariably plays a huge amount of minutes for both La Rochelle and France, whom he also captained in last season’s Friday night opener in Marseille. A year older than Doris, he has played 188 games for club and country (48 more) and this season has accumulated 1,355 minutes in total (324 more than his Irish counterpart). Colossal work-rate, too, as both an ever-willing and direct carrier, and a powerful tackler, who always seems to be in the coalface of the game. Typically, in six games against Leinster and five against Ireland, he has played 80 minutes every time. Previous meetings: Played 9, Doris 5 wins, Alldritt 4 wins.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: Spicy Bond Funds
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/spicy-bond-funds/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T01:12:57Z
Full Content:
I wrote Business Cycle: Boring Bond Funds at Seeking Alpha in June 2019, describing the yield curve and that conditions were favorable to increase allocations to bonds. In hindsight, I believe that a “soft landing” would have been achieved had it not been for the COVID-induced recession. The conservative accounts that I manage are now fully invested in bonds. In this article, we will look at “Spicy Bond Funds” for those who are interested in high yield and safety. Spicy, but not too hot, and easy to manage! There are several important considerations for investing in bonds. First, the S&P 500 earnings yield is less than the 10-year Treasury which has not occurred since the Dotcom Bubble. The stock market is overvalued by most metrics, and the return on the S&P 500 has slowed to 1.4% over the past three months. Second, the risk premium for duration and investment-grade bonds is low. This favors shorter-duration bonds with opportunities in investment-grade bonds. Third, inflation is sticky and expectations for higher inflation are rising. Fourth, policy uncertainty about tax cuts, tariffs, deporting immigrants, and spending cuts are adding to volatility and the long end of the yield curve is flattening. I use about twenty metrics from Mutual Fund Observer to rank over three hundred bond funds by Risk, Yield, Quality (including duration), Trends, and Returns weighted for a conservative investor such as myself to identify favorable Lipper Categories and high-performing funds. I preselected the funds based on risk-adjusted return and Fund Family Rating, among other factors. Performance during the COVID bear markets is one of the twenty metrics used in my ranking system. I use the MFO Great Owl rating to increase the “Rank” of funds and the “Three Alarm” rating to punish those with deteriorating performance. I use “Bullish” and “Bearish” ETF bond screens at Fidelity and Relative Strength Index (RSI) from Seeking Alpha to “bend” my rating for shorter-term momentum. The Core, General, and Corporate BBB-rated funds that I track had an average annualized return of 4.7% over the full cycle from November 2007 until December 2019 with an average APR of 0.6% during the Great Financial Crisis bear market. This compares to 8.4% for the S&P 500 over the same full cycle and -41.4% during the bear market. The bonds have a 30-day yield of 4.8% compared to 1.2% for the S&P 500. Bonds are subject to inflation, duration, and quality risk. Uncertainty can also impact bond performance. Figure #1 shows the expected inflation to be around 2.6% in the next 5 years, on average as estimated by the breakeven inflation rate. It has risen from a recent low of 1.9% in September as inflation has proven to be sticky and concerns over tariffs. The consumer price index came in higher than expected for January increasing 3.0% over the past twelve months, and 0.5% for the past month. In reaction, the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.64%. Figure #1: 5-Year Breakeven Inflation and Yield on 10-Year Treasuries Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED Database: 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate [T5YIE]; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US), Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity [DGS10] The Republican administration has suggested opening more federal land for oil leases. It takes time and money to explore these fields, evaluate the results, build the infrastructure, and drill the production wells. I don’t expect the benefits to lower inflation in the near term especially when the $72 price per barrel provides little incentive to invest. I use the yield curves from the 2004 to 2007 period to demonstrate duration risk. Bond values are inversely related to yields, and longer durations are more sensitive to changes in the yield. During this period, yields on the 10-year Treasury fluctuated around 4.5% within a range of +/- 0.6%. The dark line is the yield curve at the time of this writing. I expect it to be range bound between roughly 4.0% and 5.5% until inflation is under control and there is more clarity on the budget deficit. Figure #2: Anatomy of the Yield Curve and Inflation (2004 to 2007) Source: Author Using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED Database Pola Rocha at Investopedia explains why yields on longer duration bond rates are likely to stay higher for longer in The Treasury Secretary Says Trump Wants Long-Term Rates to Fall—It May Take a While. The Federal Reserve controls short-term rates, but long-term rates are driven more by inflation and government borrowing among other factors. Since the middle of September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose from 3.6% to 4.8% before declining to 4.4% recently. Today, it has risen back above 4.6% over hotter-than-expected inflation readings for January. Preston Caldwell, Hong Cheng, and Dominic Pappalardo at Morningstar explain in Why Long-Term Interest Rates Aren’t Falling—And What That Means For Your Portfolio that the biggest driver of higher inflation expectations is probably higher expectations for economic growth and the strength of the labor market leading to more upward pricing pressure. They suggest investors should consider moderately extending the duration of their portfolios to capture potential gains despite the likelihood of further steepening. They favor intermediate-term Treasuries. Figure #3 is based on median yields for bonds from Fidelity. For investing in investment grade bonds with a 3-year duration, an investor is receiving a historically low premium of only 0.5%, and to invest in Treasuries with a 10-year duration instead of a 2-year duration, that investor receives the same yield with no duration premium. I find the one-to-four-year duration in investment-grade debt to be attractive for taxable bonds. Figure #3: Median Yield Curves and BBB to Treasury Spread Source: Author Using Fidelity Fixed Income Data The policy changes from the new administration add uncertainty regarding tariffs, inflation, tax cut stimulus, spending cuts, budget deficits, and national debt levels. The Federal Reserve’s continuing Quantitative Tightening adds supply of long-term debt. I created Table #1 to show a comprehensive snapshot of how bond funds are performing and to better understand how I am invested. They are sorted from my highest ranked Lipper Category to lowest. The highest-ranked five funds are shown for each Lipper Category. The Tier One Categories are those with a higher risk-adjusted yield with better recent performance. They tend to have shorter durations. Tier Two Categories step further into the risk spectrum with slightly longer durations and lower quality, but still have a high risk-adjusted yield. Tier Three Categories are those with longer durations and lower risk-adjusted yields. I adjusted the yields and returns of tax-exempt funds higher to be the tax equivalent for an investor in the 22% tax bracket. Of the bond funds that Fidelity, Vanguard, or I manage, 21% are in Tier One, 12% are in Tier Two, and 48% are in Tier Three with another 18% in bond ladders. Fidelity and Vanguard manage the more aggressive side of investments and use more core bond funds, while I manage the conservative side of Bucket #2 for the intermediate term. The yield on the taxable bond funds that I manage is 5% excluding the bond ladders. I built the bond ladder mostly in Treasuries and Agency bonds with yield to maturity of 4% or higher but with low dividends. I will be investing for a sustainable higher yield as the bonds mature. Table #1: Metrics for Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The barbell strategy is a tactical strategy that involves buying short-term and long-term bonds depending upon the shape of the yield curve but nothing in between. Steve Johnson describes the barbell strategy in ‘Barbell’ Effect Helps Fixed Income Newcomers Usurp Traditional Bond Funds published in the Financial Times. Investors are moving away from actively managed mutual funds that sit in the middle to lower cost, actively managed funds on one end, and alternative vehicles, such as private credit and infrastructure debt funds, at the other. Of the top five bond funds per Lipper Category that I track, 75% are actively managed and 65% are exchange-traded funds. The bond ladder strategy is an all-weather strategy that invests in bonds that mature in given years in order to produce a steady stream of income. The main advantage is that rates can be locked in when high. The disadvantages of bond ladders are the high barrier to entry, less liquidity, default risk, and the risk of rates rising. I have about 18% of my bond investments in individual bonds (rungs) that mature each year (spacing). Exchange-traded funds that are designed to be rungs on an ETF bond ladder have been around for over a decade. Invesco manages Bulletshares bond funds and BlackRock has iShares iBonds that pay a dividend and mature in a particular year. They come in the flavors of Corporate Debt BBB-Rated, High Yield, Inflation Protected, U.S. Treasury General, and Municipal Bonds. Table #2 shows the number of funds and assets under management of these funds. Table #2: Bond Ladder ETFs. Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. They have the advantages of simplicity, diversification, liquidity, and flexibility. The disadvantages are that an active investor has the advantage of being able to selectively pick higher-yielding bonds, the dividends are not as predictable, and in the final year bonds that have matured are reinvested in Treasury bills. As a retiree, I am interested in stability and a steady stream of income. As I have written previously, traditional portfolios with a stock-to-bond ratio of 60/40 are expected to have below-average returns of around 6% in the coming decade compared to 8.3% during the 2010 decade. I see opportunities in short to intermediate-term investment-grade credit. I have been shifting from core bond funds in Tier Three to short and short-intermediate investment grade bond funds in Tier One and Two. I have been spicing up my portfolio with lower risk, higher yielding funds in the Loan Participation, High Yield with 1-to-3-year durations, and multi-sector bond funds. I avoid high-yielding funds that require a significant amount of time tracking the industries and management changes as well as hot new funds without at least three years of performance history. One of the funds that I have been buying is the Janus Henderson Aaa Clo ETF (JAAA) in the Loan Participation category. It is not the spiciest fund in the spice rack. The reasons that I like it are that it invests 95% in “AAA” bonds, only has 15% in the top ten holdings, has $20B in AUM, 92% is securitized, and expense ratio of 0.21%. During its four-year life, it has returned 4.6% annually with a maximum drawdown of 2.3%. It has a TTM yield of 6.32%. It has an MFO Risk of “1” for “Very Conservative” and is in the top quintile for risk-adjusted performance in the loan participation category. It has a FactSet rating of A, and a 5-star Morningstar rating. It is not without its risks though, with 58% invested in South America, and with 68% of its investments classified as long-term. It is not a tax-efficient fund, so I own it mostly in Traditional IRAs. Table #3 compares the highest-performing loan participation funds by my ranking system. Table #3: Bond Ladder ETFs – Three-Year Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #4 shows that while JAAA does not have the highest return, it has the lowest drawdown. That’s my kind of spice! Figure #4: High-Performing Loan Participation Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Are you looking for a good place to start? Below is a list of some of the exchange-traded funds that my system is telling me to look at. I own shares in Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), iShares Short Duration Bond Active ETF (NEAR), and iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG). Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) interests me but is not yet on my radar screen.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Monday (March 3) that its lawsuit led a federal court to temporarily halt the operations and freeze the assets of a “phantom debt collection” scheme and its operators. The commission’s complaint alleges that the operators of the scheme are Ryan and Mitchell Evans and their affiliated companies that have operated under the names Blackrock Services, Blackstone Legal Group, Capital Legal Services, Quest Legal Group, Viking Legal Services, and others, according to a Monday press release. The complaint alleges that the scheme also operated under the names of unaffiliated existing businesses and law firms, per the release. The FTC complaint alleges that debt collectors working for the operators and their affiliated companies called or wrote to consumers to collect on debts that never existed; threatened legal action that they had no basis to undertake; and falsely claimed that the fictitious debt could damage consumers’ credit and that a payment to settle the debt would lessen that harm, according to the release. “The complaint notes that letters sent by the operators often contain a wealth of sensitive personal information about the consumer, including the last four digits of their Social Security number, leading consumers to believe the letter may be legitimate,” the release said. In its complaint, the FTC asks the court to stop the defendants’ alleged unlawful conduct and provide redress to consumers they harmed, per the release. In another, separate case, the FTC said Dec. 10 that it began sending over $540,000 in refunds to consumers harmed by a debt collection scheme. The refunds followed the FTC’s filing of lawsuits in September 2020 and reaching settlements in March 2021 and December 2021 with National Landmark Logistics and Absolute Financial Services, which also operated under other names. In the settlements, the defendants were permanently banned from the debt collection industry and were required to pay money to compensate the consumers. In November, the FTC took action against Global Circulation and its owner, Kenneth Redon, III, alleging that the debt collector tricked consumers into paying more than $7.6 million in bogus debt by threatening them with unlawful actions.

Title: They warn about Netflix email scam; It looks real but it’s AI
URL: https://www.merca20.com/they-warn-about-netflix-email-scam-it-looks-real-but-its-ai/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T23:58:22Z
Full Content:
Users of Netflix have been warned to be alert to a “sinister” email scam powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that looks almost indistinguishable from the real one. This highlights how scams on social media and the internet have reached alarming levels in recent years, and one of the most effective methods for criminals is the misuse of well-known brand names. Recognized companies such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Adidas, and BBVA have become bait to lure unsuspecting consumers, who often fall for fake offers, nonexistent contests, or fraudulent banking alerts. A report from the Mexican Cybersecurity Association revealed that, during 2024, reports of digital fraud grew by 38 percent compared to the previous year. Of these, 60 percent involved the unauthorized use of recognized brands. According to the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services (Condusef), digital fraud resulted in losses of more than 12 billion pesos in 2024 alone in Mexico. Scams involving the names of major global brands continue to emerge on the internet. Now, one involving Netflix is being reported, which seems “real” because it uses Artificial Intelligence. “Your account is on hold,” the notice says. “Update your payment details. We are having some issues with your current billing information. We will try again, but in the meantime, you may want to update your payment details,” reads the message. It also includes a red button that looks official and says “Update account now.” According to many people, this correspondence is almost identical to a legitimate Netflix message, from the branding to the colors and even the links to the official help page of the platform. When the user clicks on the red button, they are redirected to a convincing Netflix login page, where they will be asked for their username, password, personal address, and Netflix card details. If entered, the user has basically provided the cybercriminals with everything they need to steal their money. While these malicious messaging campaigns have existed since the early days of email, “AI technology has now allowed criminal gangs to generate phishing campaigns at great speed and to more email addresses than ever before,” warned Jake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor for cybersecurity firm ESET. He also added that “cybercriminals have been exploiting AI to target large amounts of email addresses and can easily create login pages that look authentic to trick users into revealing personal information or account credentials.” “However, like traditional phishing attacks, these scams often try to create a sense of urgency, prompting recipients to act quickly without verifying the true origin of the sender or even thinking at all,” he said. Fortunately, there are some telltale signs that an email is a digital wolf in sheep’s clothing. In this case, the email originated from an iCloud email domain, while official Netflix emails always come from an address ending in netflix.com. Netflix also clarified on its site that it will never request bank account details, credit card numbers, or passwords via text message or email. The best way to verify the authenticity of an email is by logging into your official account. With this, we see how these scams continue to grow, prompting major brands to take steps to combat this issue. Companies like BBVA and Amazon have strengthened their awareness campaigns, warning their customers about the risks of interacting with unknown links and unverified profiles. Additionally, platforms like Meta have implemented stricter verification mechanisms for business accounts. The rise of scams on social media and the internet using major brand names serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and critical thinking when browsing online. While businesses and authorities strengthen their protection strategies, individual prevention remains the best defense against these frauds. When does Red Lobster’s Lobsterfest end?

A critical potable water issue, essential for launch pad preparation, would not be resolved until January 2026, creating a substantial risk that the Neutron rocket would not launch as planned in mid-2025. Additionally, Neutron’s only contract was secured at a discount with an unreliable partner. The lawsuit further claims that on February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report titled “Rocket Lab (RKLB): We Think It’s Gonna Be a Long, Long Time,” alleging that Rocket Lab had misled investors about the likelihood of a mid-2025 Neutron launch. Following this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price dropped nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Please visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.

Title: The Weakening Economy Needs Rate Relief

Time Published: 2025-03-03T22:52:28Z

Equity markets were down for the week (again). But it could have been much worse, as the closing results were much improved from Friday’s lows at about 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500, for example, finished the day with a +2% gain as markets rallied into the close.[1] As shown in the table, 2025 has been mixed with the S&P 500 and the DJIA positive while the tech heavy Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 are negative for the year. Equity Market Uncertainty is clearly the order of the day (Trump vs. Zelenskyy, DOGE’s actions to terminate thousands of federal jobs, the imposition of tariffs beginning March 5). It has now appeared to have permeated and soured investor views. The volatility the markets just experienced oftentimes marks a turn in investor attitudes. According to Rosenberg Research, only 29 other times over the last 9000-plus trading sessions have we seen the intraday volatility that occurred on Friday (February 28).[1] The other occasions occurred in 2022, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998. Some of these years were years of Recession. Magnificent 7 Despite showing strong sales and profits (+80%) and guiding higher, Nvidia’s stock still got pummeled, down -7% for the week and about the same year-to-date.[1] It isn’t every day that a tech titan comes in with such good numbers and its share price tanks. A look at the Mag 7 in total shows lower prices across the board for the week and for six out of the seven on a year-to-date basis (Meta being the exception). Could it be that the markets see a slowing economy? Or has the market just run too far? So far in 2025, all the housing data have tanked. Pending Home Sales Most analysts blame these downtrends on high interest rates. But, as shown in the chart below, mortgage rates have been at or near 7% since late 2022; so, something else must be at play. Perhaps the slowdown in the general economy is the culprit. 30 Year Mortgage Rate The weakening economy, high mortgage rates, and the perception by consumers that inflation will continue to be an issue, has taken its toll. The chart shows that consumers still see many hurdles to overcome in the home buying process. Buying Conditions for Houses Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose +22,000 in the week ended February 22 to 242,000 from 220,000 the prior week.[1] Continuing Claims, at 2,234,000 are nearly +101,000 higher than a year ago.[2] Due to the DOGE purges in D.C., these numbers will certainly rise sharply over the next few months. Depending on how rapidly the economy slows, we expect the U3 unemployment rate to rise to somewhere between 4.5% and 5.0% over the next six months. Inflation is a process. It isn’t “high prices.” Those “high prices” are the result of inflation. One cause of inflation that economists and the folks who run the Fed worry about is something called the “wage-price” spiral. Simply put, this is where rising wages cause businesses to raise prices which in turn leads to demands for higher wages. Wage Growth & The Quits Rate The chart shows the year/year wage and salary growth rate (blue line) and a smoothed version of the JOLTS “Quits Rate.” Note the strong relationship. When the Quits Rate falls, so does the rate of wage growth. That seems logical. The Quits Rate falls when employers cut back on hiring and jobs become harder to find. The Conference Board’s latest Consumer Confidence Survey complements this chart, showing a rise in the consumer view that jobs are now harder to get than they were just a few months ago. Also in that Survey, the view that there will be fewer jobs over the next six months hit a 12-year high. Generally, we find such views in a slowing economy. Hence, our view that inflation will be at or below the Fed’s target by mid-year. The University of Michigan’s most recent Consumer Sentiment Survey hit its lowest level since November 2023. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months spiked to 3.5% in December.[1] This is the highest level for this indicator since April 1995. No doubt the tariff threats from the Trump administration played a key role. Just for clarity, the tariffs will have an initial impact on inflation, but economists believe that it is a one-time adjustment and doesn’t feed the inflation process. This is a problem the Fed is going to have to deal with and it is likely why markets don’t see any rate decreases for several months. Policy uncertainty has had a large impact on the equity markets. “Tariffs On,” “Tariffs Off.” Which will it be? March 5 appears to be the destiny date. If the tariffs are actually imposed, expect more equity market volatility as that will be another hurdle for the economy. There is no doubt that the U.S. economy is slowing. This appears to be a worldwide phenomenon as the economies of China and those in Europe are slowing, too. In the U.S., we’ve recently seen a decline in Retail Sales, and we know that it isn’t a one-off because Walmart gave very soft guidance. Housing is the poster child for the economic slowdown. The latest housing data screams Recession. And the latest consumer confidence surveys have all turned negative. High interest rates are killing the housing sector. New and Existing Home Sales continue to slow. Because inflation expectations are stuck at levels higher than the Fed’s target rates, the prospect of much needed interest rate relief still appears to be several months away. Our view is that the Fed is already behind the curve, and if they wait until the inflation indexes actually hit their 2% goal before granting rate relief, the economy will already be in Recession. Remember, interest rates impact the economy with long and variable lags. This Fed’s mindset: “No rate relief until the inflation numbers yield.” But if it waits much longer, it will be too late. In fact, it may have already waited too long. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Chips Act funding could be at risk as Trump cuts federal workers

The Trump administration’s large-scale layoffs of federal workers could affect the rollout of former President Joe Biden’s efforts to bring advanced chipmaking back to the U.S. The Chips Program Office, which oversees the implementation of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, is set to lose two-fifths of its workforce, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people. About 20 employees have left after accepting deferred resignations, according to Bloomberg, and about 40 probationary workers are bracing for layoffs on Monday. The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. The terminations won’t have a big effect on employees negotiating contracts with companies receiving funding, one person told Bloomberg. These employees are responsible for tracking progress on contractual benchmarks. Leaders in the Chips Program Office met Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to discourage him from laying off those employees, Bloomberg reported. Other Chips Act funding projects may be at risk due to federal cuts, including $500 million in funding for smaller companies involved in the semiconductor supply chain. Lutnick has asked the office’s employees how it’s making funding decisions, and how the government could get money back that has been awarded, according to Bloomberg. He’s also interested in limiting how companies who have received Chips Act funding can conduct business in China, the news service said. Employees are looking at ways to amend applications for funding and contract language that could meet the Trump administration’s demands, Bloomberg said. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+2.02%) (TSMC), a recipient of Chips Act funding, announced it’s planning to invest at least $100 billion to build out chip plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of jobs.

Title: Joe Rogan & Elon Musk Spark Conspiracy Theory About CNN
URL: https://littlethings.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-elon-musk-spark-conspiracy-that-cnn-was-involved-with-assassination-attempt
Time Published: 2025-03-03T22:05:11Z
Full Content:
Home Entertainment Joe Rogan had Elon Musk back on his podcast heading into the weekend, and after the two got through talking, the conspiracy theorists were fired up about the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. And CNN … well, it can’t be appreciating the unwarranted heat directed at it. Rogan and Musk also discussed the billionaire’s controversial hand gesture at President Donald Trump’s inauguration that many believed resembled a Nazi salute, and Rogan said he thought it was “strange” that people that people would think that way. Then Musk threw out a few Nazi puns, telling Rogan “I did not see it coming,” while discussing folks calling him a Nazi on X after the incident. “People will Goebbels anything down,” he added. More from LittleThings: Joe Rogan Calls Girl Scout Cookies ‘Toxic As [Expletive]’ On His Podcast The two found that pretty darned funny, and had some laughs, but that wasn’t the issue for CNN. That came when Rogan wondered openly about the assassination attempt on Trump at his rally in Butler in 2024. After first wondering if BlackRock was involved, Rogan pivoted. “I highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this,” he said. “I think more likely it’s individuals involved that recognize that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated. And so, a small group of people carry something out, and with this kid, we don’t know anything, and everyone stopped asking question and there was never a formal report. There was never press conferences when they detailed all the information that we know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment. What we know is we have a very young kid, who was filmed, they knew he was there with a rangefinder a half an hour before the event.” The next part is what had folks targeting CNN. “You also know that CNN streamed it live, which I do not believe they did for any other rally, and certainly not for a rally in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania,” Rogan said. “Like, there’s a lot of weird s—.” That led many of the conspiracy theorists to believe that Rogan was suggesting that CNN might have known about the attempt in advance. Of course, Rogan is a big enough name that he could have reached out to CNN to ask about that, and all of this could have been avoided. But he didn’t and so folks took it and ran with it. “What are the chances @CNN was tipped off to stream the Butler rally?” billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter. “Why isn’t this worthy of an investigation? It shouldn’t be too hard to figure out who orders the coverage and why.” CNN, of course, did have an answer and it does make sense. If anyone cares. “CNN provided live coverage of President Trump’s Butler, PA, rally in anticipation of news about his pick of Vice President,” the network said while responding to several accounts on X. “Any suggestion contrary to that fact is completely false.” —Brian Linder, pennlive.com (TNS) ©2025 Advance Local Media LLC.

Title: 6 Vanguard Index Funds To Buy Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-vanguard-index-funds-buy-now/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:33:34Z

Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth.

It’s no secret that Kara Swisher has been trying to figure out how to take the Washington Post off Jeff Bezos’s hands, even though it’s not for sale and the billionaire seems unlikely to part with it any time soon. In the latest episode of On With Kara Swisher, she details why she’s on this “quixotic mission”; laments the Post’s recent struggles, including Bezos’s latest editorial meddling; and shares some conversations she’s had with trusted advisers about her plan, the Post’s legacy and troubles, and why the paper should and must be saved. Below is her opening pitch. Journalist Kara Swisher brings the news and newsmakers to you twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. Kara Swisher: I’m not peacocking … I’m not trying to shame Jeff, either. It’s neither a troll, nor a tale of business derring-do, though I certainly have the ability to raise the money needed. And I have a plan I think would help get the Post back on its feet. But here’s the simple truth: This is a love story. So let me begin by telling you it, and I’ll keep it brief. I got my job at the Washington Post by calling the Metro editor and yelling about a story I had seen in the paper. I was covering the story from my college newspaper, which was at Georgetown University, and the Post did a terrible job of it. And I was angry because I loved the Washington Post, and I was disappointed that they did such a bad job. I got the Metro editor on the phone on my first try, and he invited me down to the Washington Post, which at the time was on 15th Street. So I jumped on the M2 bus and rode it down to the Post. And I walked into the Post newsroom for the very first time, and it was love at first sight. I told the editor my problems that I had with what they had done and how angry I was. And he told me I was obnoxious. Well, I was, but he had let me down, and I said I could do a better job. Right then and there, he hired me as stringer for the Washington Post. And I wrote innumerable stories about the college I was going to. So many, that it got me into the graduate school of journalism at Columbia. I got my first job in journalism by being irritating, so why should I stop now? Back to my career there, I later went on to work in the mail room, as night copy aide, as a news aide, an intern for “Style Plus,” a fill-in for the business section, which morphed into a reporting job including covering retail workplace issues, and ultimately being the first reporter to cover the nascent digital-services business in D.C. in the form of a small company in Vienna, Virginia, called AOL, America Online. It was there I met many people who are now the richest and most powerful in the world. For the most part, they were scrappy entrepreneurs with only a germ of an idea, a difficult road, but lots of aggressive drive. That included Jeff Bezos, who I met in Seattle when I went to check out his start-up called Amazon in the 1990s. As I described him in my memoir, Burn Book, up in Seattle, a short and energetic man was lousy at hiding his wanting ambitions, masking them behind a genuinely infectious, maniacal laugh, a curiously baby-fat face, and an anodyne presentation of pleated khakis, sensible shoes, and a blue oxford shirt. Still, from the start, I had no doubt that Jeff Bezos would eat my face off if that’s what he needed to do to get ahead. Feral, in fact, was the first word that jumped into my head when I met Bezos in the mid-1990s. He brought me to an industrial area near the airport, and I watched as he skittered around the warehouse like a frenetic mongoose. We talked a lot in those days, largely because he needed me to shine a light on his efforts at a very dicey time for Amazon. First when I was at the Post and then at The Wall Street Journal, where I went in 1997 as its first reporter specifically covering the internet. After a lot of ups and downs, Amazon soared on that mongoose energy. Fast forward to 2013 when he suddenly, and a surprise to me, bought the Post from the Graham family for $250 million. By then, it was struggling to deal with the digital age, and I was hopeful that Jeff’s innovative spirit and piles of money would save the paper. Even before Bezos came on the scene, I had been warning former Post owner Don Graham that print newspapers were done for. Despite worries about the tech takeover of media, I hoped Jeff would fully embrace online journalism while holding true to the journalistic standards and ethics of the legacy paper. So I wrote an open letter to Bezos on my media start-up, AllThingsD, and offered some advice: “Don’t treat the Post like some precious thing that cannot be touched or changed. While you certainly should respect its vaunted traditions and hue to ethical standards, that does not mean it gets to stay as it is. That’s the big danger here, that you start acting like the steward of history rather than using the fantastic Washington Post brand to make some new history.” And for the first decade of owning the company, he was a very good owner, trying all manner of updating tech and supporting the newsroom. It was not the glory days of Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham, but it was a solid effort, even if the paper always seemed to lag behind the New York Times. Mostly, he kept his mitts off, which was the right thing to do. He even quietly endured endless attacks from President Donald Trump in his first administration. Again, it was the right thing to do, and he was public about that commitment. Here’s what he said to Axel Springer’s CEO, Mathias Döpfner, about his role at the Post back in 2018. Jeff Bezos: As the owner of the Post, I know at times the Post is going to write stories that are going to make very powerful people very unhappy. Mathias Döpfner: Are you upset if they’re writing critical stories about Amazon, which they do? Bezos: No, no, I’m not upset at all. When I first bought the Post — Döpfner: Would you ever interfere? Bezos: Never. Döpfner: No? Bezos: Never. I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. It would be one of those things, when I’m 80 years old, I would be so unhappy with myself if I interfered. Why would I? Döpfner: Yeah. Bezos: I want that paper to be independent. He went on to say that telling the newsroom what to do would be like taking controls from the pilots of a plane. But when the Trump circus left town and the inexorable decline of the traditional-media business accelerated, losses mounted, and Jeff started to make one bad move after another. In 2023, after bringing in former Microsoft executive Patty Stonesifer, who was well liked at the Post despite having to preside over layoffs and buyouts, Bezos then shows Will Lewis to take over as the new CEO. Lewis had tried to be a media entrepreneur, emphasis on tried, and had been a former CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and before that, a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp back in the days of the U.K. phone-hacking scandal. And one of the first things he did after taking his job at the Post, after trashing the reporters for not wanting to change, which was entirely untrue and obnoxious, in not the good way, was apparently trying to kill a story about his own alleged involvement in that scandal. And when Lewis ousted then–executive editor Sally Buzbee, the first woman to serve in that role, newsroom morale plummeted. Then last October, Bezos decided the Post would end a decadeslong practice and pulled the newsroom’s planned endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris. That Bezos himself made the decision, not Lewis, is according to the Post’s own reporting. While he certainly was within his rights to do so, the timing was curious and there was fallout. Three hundred thousand Post readers canceled their digital subscriptions in response. No surprise, a growing number of editors and reporters started leaving as newsroom morale plummeted once again. That included my wife, former opinion editor Amanda Katz. And at the dawn of Trump 2.0, there have been other examples of the Post seeming to obey in advance. In January, Pulitzer Prize–winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after she said opinion editor David Shipley rejected her cartoon depicting Bezos and other tech billionaires bending the knee before Trump. Last month, the Post pulled an ad deal that called on Trump to fire Elon Musk. And just in case that wasn’t enough, Bezos and many other tech billionaires paid a million dollars plus to yuck it up onstage with Trump during the inauguration. Jeff looked like a prop and a stooge. Finally, last week, Bezos announced that the Post opinion section would be refocused to only publish pieces that are “in support and defense of personal liberties and free markets,” which in libertarian billionaire nincompoop speak roughly translates to “Personal liberties means doing whatever the fuck I want. Free markets means doing whatever the fuck I want.” Now, I love capitalism too, but what that means in practice is incomprehensible and really just dumb. That move essentially forced the resignation of the opinion editor, David Shipley, who declined, as Bezos noted, not to say “hell yes.” “Hell no” was the right response. That was a far cry from that 2018 interview: Bezos: I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed I would turn bright red. And it is nothing to do with … I don’t even get so far … I just don’t want to. For me, it would feel icky. It would feel gross. I don’t know if Bezos is now so comfortable with all this interference that he’s gotten over the ick factor, but the rest of us haven’t. As far as I’m concerned, he has killed the Post’s legacy of justice, fairness, commitment to the First Amendment, accountability, and epic badassery created by Ben Bradlee and Kay Graham. Here’s former Post reporter Martha Sherrill: We were always asking more, and we’re pretending we didn’t know things that we maybe thought we knew. But at the same time, you had to kind of have the balls to put the story together. The problem is that Bezos isn’t just any owner. He’s one of the top tech titans in the world, and his real business interests are in Amazon and Blue Origin and not the Post. Now, the biggest competitor to Blue Origin, Elon Musk, is working directly with Trump running DOGE, and I think Jeff wants some of that sweet, sweet government money. Owning an independent media company that is reporting on a presidency and administration that could make or break him, even if he was not such an embarrassing cheerleader, has become a clear conflict of interest. I don’t want to buy the Washington Post to put it on a nostalgia shelf like some precious tchotchke. Even though the Post reportedly lost $100 million last year and about $77 million a year before, I believe there’s an opportunity here. This post has been updated. It originally said that Jeff Bezos hired former Post editor Marty Baron. Baron started as Executive Editor in January 2013, and Bezos completed his purchase of the company that October. The transcript has also been edited for length and clarity. The rest of the episode is a wide-ranging discussion of the Washington Post’s past, present, and future among Kara and former Post writer Sally Quinn, media legend Tina Brown, reporter and critic Oliver Darcy, former Post national editor Cameron Barr, and others. Listen to it here.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is investing billions of dollars to boost chip manufacturing in the U.S. The Taiwanese chipmaker plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out plants in the U.S. over the next four years, the Trump administration announced on Monday. Most of the investment will be focused in Arizona where TSMC (TSM+2.02%) is already building a chipmaking hub, President Donald Trump said during a briefing. He added that the plan includes building five cutting-edge chip fabrication facilities in Arizona that will create thousands of high-paying jobs. “The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America,” Trump said. “It will be a big percentage of the chips made by this company.” The announcement brings TSMC’s total U.S. investment to $165 billion. “This will create hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity and boost America’s dominance in artificial intelligence and beyond,” Trump said. “Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy and, really, without the semiconductors there is no economy.” Trump said the U.S. “must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor.” “We are going to produce many AI chips,” TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei said during the announcement. “We are going to produce many tools to support the AI progress and to support the smartphone progress.” In October, Bloomberg reported that the chipmaker’s chip production yields — or the number of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — are about four percentage points higher at its Phoenix, Arizona site than those of comparable fabs in Taiwan. The company’s first major U.S. hub includes two chipmaking facilities expected to begin production this year and in 2028. Meanwhile, TSMC was awarded up to $6.6 billion in direct funding under the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act in November. Some of the funding — which will go toward its Phoenix hub — will be used to build a third fab, the Biden administration said, adding that it will put the U.S. on track to produce 20% of the world’s advanced chips by 2030. In September, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported that TSMC is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple — one of its major customers — at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said, adding that TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year.

Title: Dow tumbles 800 points as Trump confirms tariffs on Mexico and Canada will start Tuesday | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks slid Monday as investors braced for President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico to go into effect by the midnight deadline. The Dow tumbled 650 points, or 1.48%, to close at 43,191. The Dow fell almost 900 points in afternoon trading before pulling back slightly. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.64%. The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day decline of the year. The Nasdaq is down about 6.5% since since Trump took office on January 20. “Tomorrow, tariffs — 25% on Canada and 25% on Mexico,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “And that’ll start. … What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.” Trump said the two trading partners had “no room” left to negotiate to avoid the levies and that he was using tariffs to “punish” countries that, as he put it, were taking from the US economy without giving enough in return. “They’re all set. They go into effect tomorrow,” he said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would immediately respond with tariffs on $30 billion of US goods if the Trump administration’s measures go into effect. “Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,” he said in a statement. Trump also signed an executive order on Monday raising tariffs on imports from China to 20%, up from 10%. Trump said the tariffs, aimed at bringing China to the table on curtailing fentanyl entering the United States, will be raised because Beijing has not done enough to stem the flow of illegal drugs. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged to its highest point this year after Trump’s comments. “Due to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, the stock market has erased the gains from the ‘Trump bump’ following the presidential election and the expected upward pressure on prices is giving investors pause,” said Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University. “For investors, 2025 can still be a positive year for stocks, but it may take all year to realize gains. And they may be modest,” said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. “I’m still a bull,” Bolvin said. The import taxes Trump imposed are significant — the largest in US-China history. The initial tariffs, which went into effect February 4, set in motion tariffs on $1.4 trillion of imported goods. That’s more than triple the $380 billion worth of foreign goods that were hit with tariffs during Trump’s first term, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday the country was “strongly dissatisfied” and “firmly opposed” the additional tariff. “(China) will take countermeasures to firmly safeguard its own rights and interests,” the spokesperson added in a statement. Before he became president, Trump pledged a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, so the tariff level could rise still. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference about tariffs on Canada and Mexico that global companies can avoid tariffs if they invest into production in the United States, like TSMC, the Taiwanese chipmaker at the White House on Monday to announce a $100 billion US investment. Related article Trump’s tariff chaos threatens an economy already flashing yellow lights Trump’s tariffs will raise prices of imported goods, which could boost demand for goods produced in the US, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. But they also noted that tariffs will have negative effects on some American businesses. “Tariff increases will also raise production costs for some domestic producers and will likely prompt foreign retaliation against some US exports, both of which could hurt domestic production,” they wrote in a note. US stocks are “likely to be volatile” until Trump’s policies point toward being more growth-focused, said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Monday. Draho said he does expect future growth and maintains a “positive medium-term outlook.” The stock market began to slide Monday morning to begin the new month, as investors digested the latest manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management. The survey showed economic activity in the manufacturing industry remained in expansion territory, yet slowed last month. Tariff fears dominated write-in responses to the survey. Markets slid Monday afternoon after Trump posted on Truth Social that he plans to implement tariffs on “external product[s],” potentially including agricultural products. Trump’s post referred to his plan for reciprocal tariffs, set to take place on April 2, according to a person familiar, though it was not immediately clear how these tariffs would be implemented. “To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!” Trump said in the post.

The stocks dragging markets lower on Monday included Nvidia (NVDA), which fell 8.7%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 4.16%, signaling concerns about uncertainty and future economic growth. Bitcoin traded around $85,600 on Monday afternoon, down 8.6% in the past day and largely erasing gains made after Trump on Sunday announced a strategic crypto reserve that would include bitcoin. Meanwhile, shares in defense companies in Europe soared to record highs on Monday as European leaders consider the need to re-arm amid less US support for Ukraine. WTI crude, the US oil benchmark, fell about 2% to its lowest price since December after OPEC+ announced it would begin producing more oil in April.

Sunday's Trump bump in crypto has mostly vanished nearly as quickly as it appeared. In mid-afternoon U.S. action, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $86,700, barely above its level prior to President Trump taking to social media Sunday to tout his plans for coming U.S. crypto reserve. Ether is now actually beneath its pre-Trump level and at 0.025, the ETH/BTC ratio has touched a new five-year low. Other tokens touted by Trump as part of the coming crypto reserve — Solana's (SOL), Ripple's (XRP) and Cardano's (ADA) — have given up sizable amounts of their Sunday gains, though remain somewhat higher than prior to the president's posting. “Crypto vols are still relatively elevated with both majors still reflecting a Put Skew till end-March,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote to their investors. “The VIX is also elevated, signaling broader market unease in risk assets overall, particularly after the recent tariff escalations from the U.S. administration.” Crypto stocks have given up large chunks are early gains on Monday, with a number of them — Core Scientific (CORZ) and Bitdeer (BTDR) among them — now sporting sizable losses on the session. Medical equipment maker Semler Scientific (SMLR) — perhaps better-known for its bitcoin treasury strategy — is off 7.3% today after a DOJ investigation for possible violations of a federal anti-fraud law related to its marketing of a product known as QuantaFlo, reported Stat News. The broader stock market is also in the red, with the Nasdaq shedding 1.1% and S&P 500 0.8% ahead of Trump's promised tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) is down 6.5% on news that Singapore has charged three men in a U.S. export controls breach case. “Concerns over U.S. growth, and impending tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada — set to take effect tomorrow — will be in focus, driving equities and rates,” said Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at crypto market maker Wintermute.

Nvidia (NVDA+0.37%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.46%), and Dell (DELL+3.27%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC-4.82%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO+1.73%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM+1.75%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

Title: Far away, so close – Fionnuala Ward on measuring distance
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irish-diary/2025/03/03/far-away-so-close-fionnuala-ward-on-measuring-distance/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T18:49:00Z
Full Content:
I’m not good at gauging distance. As a non-driver, I’ve been in that navigator role in the front seat and been told to watch out as the sat-nav woman talks about turning left in 300 metres or 500 metres or something like that. I find myself fixating on that initial number and deciding, in my scientific way, that if it’s below five metres, that turn must be pretty close, and if above, means I can take a breath here. And as for talk of heading east or west, north or south or, better still, northwest or southeast? So this is what civilisation has wrought? Useful perhaps when traversing the Savannah, not so much when negotiating the labyrinth of roads around a busy city centre. However, I comfort myself in the knowledge that distance and length issues aside, when it comes to spatial awareness and our understanding of our location in the universe, together we are all on a downward trajectory. Maps blew about in the wind, got torn and never folded away properly. But they did marshall a platoon of brain cells to jump into action and make sense of those squiggly lines which has to have been a good thing. So the phone has a lot to answer for. The phone and the car. Years ago now, I went on the Dart to visit a school for a particular event. I knew where it was, kind of, and the plan was to make my way there on foot. But I somehow managed to wander off in the wrong direction when coming out of the station and even with my Google Maps app got completely lost. I rang the school, apologetic and embarrassed, and asked for directions. No need, I was told. A parent was on her way down right now. And one materialised, very kindly, 10 minutes later. Walking from the station wasn’t an option, she explained as we wound our way to the school gates. That would have taken 20 minutes, probably more. Once the event in the school was over, I made my goodbyes and with directions freshly explained, headed for the station. I was there in six minutes. The car. What is it good for? Well, when it comes to assessing distance, absolutely nothing. My uncle used to tell the story about how he and my father would head from Dundalk to Blackrock on Thursday afternoons during the summer. Their parents’ grocery-pub business closed early on a Thursday which meant they were off duty and could go for a swim. But they only had access to the one bicycle which, for some reason since lost in the mists of time, didn’t have a crossbar, so no carrying of passengers could take place. Walking all the way was out of the question for the two young lads so instead they came up with a system, whereby each could have a go on the bike. They would head off, one walking one cycling, with the cyclist inevitably overtaking the pedestrian, although generally not without some obligatory jeering and minor threats to stay on the bike for the entire trip. Further along the route, he would drop the bicycle at the side of the road and continue on foot. The pedestrian would find the bicycle, jump on board and the process was repeated. Without a shadow of a doubt, the pair developed a forensically analysed and mathematically correct understanding of what three miles entailed. And more, much more, given the fact that once they arrived in Blackrock, yet more walking had to be undertaken to catch the tide – this lovely, seaside Louth village having at best an intermittent relationship with the sea. I can attest to this from childhood experience as on trips to Dundalk, we would occasionally pour into the car, Blackrock-bound, confident in fact that those rocks and rock-pools would be as explorable as ever, the tide having only an occasional interest in them. But back to the present or maybe not quite. The lockdowns helped. For a while there, we knew what a radius of 2km entailed and then 4km and wider. But even that momentary epiphany came and went. I like walking to work. It wakes me up and, having arrived at my destination, elicits a feeling of exquisite self-righteousness that starts the day off very nicely. But I recently overheard someone living locally speak of a similar distance as being “too far” for anything other than the car. It seems that distance, like time, is entirely measurable and yet also oddly subjective. We experience it in different ways. Mind you, we still need a common understanding of what 300 metres or 500 metres actually means. And I’m still working on that. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: INVESTOR ALERT: Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Investigates Claims on Behalf of Investors of Novo Nordisk

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Conspiracy Theorists Think Mark Zuckerberg Started Myrtle Beach Wildfires
URL: https://gizmodo.com/conspiracy-theorists-think-mark-zuckerberg-started-myrtle-beach-wildfires-2000570780
Time Published: 2025-03-03T18:25:13Z
Full Content:
At least 175 wildfires have been burning in the Carolinas since this past weekend, with one fire near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, burning about 1,600 acres and forcing residents to evacuate, according to CNN. Enormous wildfires are atypical for North and South Carolina, but dry and windy conditions, with gusts over 130 mph, explain why these fires are so difficult to fight. That’s not good enough for conspiracy theorists, of course. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has been flooded in recent days with conspiracy theories insisting the fires were started by powerful tech figures like Mark Zuckerberg as part of some dastardly attempt to turn Myrtle Beach into a so-called smart city. And while that’s an absurd claim, it’s becoming an extremely common one as climate change creates the ideal conditions for intense fires in very odd places. Right-wing influencer John Sabal, tweeting as The Patriot Voice, insisted that what was happening in Myrtle Beach was so unusual it must be something suspicious, even claiming that local news held clues about what was in store. “WHEN is the last time you have EVER heard of Myrtle Beach having damn ‘wildfires’?!?!?!” Sabal tweeted. “They think we are STUPID. If you pay close enough attention, they ALWAYS tell you in advance what they are planning, like on this news broadcast.” Sabal went on to insist the fires were started with directed energy weapons, another way of saying that these wildfires were probably started by some kind of space laser. “The ‘wildfires’ are being set off INTENTIONALLY by DEWs (Directed Energy Weapons) so they can easily burn down the area, where Blackrock can then come in and buy it all up cheap and rebuild it into a 15 minute ‘smart city’ PRISON,” Sabal continued. Sabal claimed this is “EXACTLY what happened” in other recent fires in Hawaii, Texas, and California, all places where conspiracy theorists have previously claimed space lasers were being used to create destruction. Then, Sabal pointed out this was happening “even” as Donald Trump was president and claimed that Zuckerberg might be behind it. “It looks like this time, Mark Zuckerberg has his hands ALL over this one, VERY CONCERNING considering he was just at the Inauguration and now is looking at moving D.C. to be close to Trump,” Sabal claimed. Zuckerberg has indeed been cozying up to Trump ever since the assassination attempt against the president last summer. The Meta CEO even donated money and showed up at Trump’s inauguration. But everything else about what Sabal is saying isn’t true. Sabal shared a video from TikTok about Meta’s plans to add new technology to Myrtle Beach. The local news clip from June 2023 talks about how technology was helping add 3D simulations for tourism promotion and how gunfire detection tech might make the city safer. Reasonably, people can debate whether these are good uses of taxpayer resources, but it’s not exactly evidence of some grand conspiracy to burn Myrtle Beach to the ground. Sabal was far from the only one spreading these conspiracy theories on social media. HustleBitch, a right-wing account you may recognize from previous debunkers, tweeted Sunday the same baseless conspiracy theories, making similar connections to fires in Lahaina and Maui, Hawaii. HustleBitch also shared the same video from WMBF in South Carolina as some kind of gotcha moment, as though trying to introduce some extremely tame tech upgrades to any city is evidence of anything more nefarious. Responses to HustleBitch’s tweets insist the fires are also being caused by weather modification, something that’s apparently easier to believe than pointing at climate change. And that seems to be the crux of the problem. Whenever something terrible is happening, people naturally look for ways to prevent it from happening again. That sometimes leads people to find causal connections that simply aren’t there. There’s no evidence that any Big Tech figures are intentionally starting wildfires to buy up land and start their own cities from scratch. There is, however, lots of evidence that the wealthiest guy in the world is currently dismantling the federal government and setting the U.S. economy on a path of destruction to line his own pockets. But believing a guy like Elon Musk could be doing everything he promised doesn’t quite fit with their worldview. No, we need space lasers for some reason. Apparently, it’s more exciting that way. Musk doesn’t need space lasers. But he’s going to do a lot more damage than any space laser has ever done if he’s allowed to continue.

Title: Target Loses As Costco Wins Web Traffic On Feb. 28 Economic Blackout Day

Target’s online traffic dropped during The People’s Union USA Economic Blackout on Feb. 28, according to data from website analytics platform Similarweb. And while the boycott was not explicitly targeting brands that rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Costco’s uptick in online traffic on the same day, brings the conversation back to the forefront. On Feb. 28 blackout day, Target website visitors dropped 9% compared to Friday, Feb. 14, from 5.2 ... [+] million to 4.7 million. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) On blackout day, Target website visitors dropped 9% compared to Friday, Feb. 14, from 5.2 million to 4.7 million. Target app user traffic, representing the most loyal Target customers, was off even more, down 14%, from 4.2 million to 3.5 million. By comparison, Costco experienced a 22% rise in Feb. 28 web traffic, from 2.4 million Feb. 14 to 2.9 million and Costco app user visits rose 3%, from 1.3 million to 1.34 million. On blackout day, the nation’s number one retailer, Walmart, experienced a 5% slump in web traffic, down from 11.7 million on Feb. 14 to 11.2 million and number two Amazon dropped by 2%, from 67.1 million to 65.9 million. However, Amazon app traffic rose 1% to 51.4 million visitors while Walmart’s dropped 2% to 13.6 million. Ever since Target announced at the end of January that it had concluded its three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals, calls for boycotts against Target have been growing, most recently with Black faith and civil rights leaders advocating for a 40-day “Target Fast” over Lent starting this Ash Wednesday. About the same time as Target was dialing back DEI, Costco affirmed its strong DEI commitment after striking down a proxy vote to evaluate its current policy’s risks in light of rising anti-DEI political and legal pressure. While website traffic can rise and fall sharply on any given day for any number of reasons, it would appear that Target is beginning to experience pullback from its most loyal app-user customer base. Target reports full-year 2024 earnings tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET and its fourth quarter will only include results covering a week or so after the DEI pushback began. So we’ll have to wait for next quarter to see impact from the boycott calls. However, Target gave a sneak peek at holiday results and reported a 2.8% net sales increase over November and December, including a nearly 9% increase in digital sales compared to prior year. Blackrock, the world’s largest investment firm and one of the leading advocates for strong DEI and environmental, social and governance policies, has been “walking back” its ESG/DEI positions, the Wall Street Journal reported. Last Friday, it told employees it was ending “aspirational workforce representation goals” as a result of “significant changes to the U.S. legal and policy environment.” “In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations—companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise. These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitments necessary to build a just society. As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity,” states the TargetFast.org website.

Two of the biggest standalone VR headsets are about to do battle When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We're living in the age of standalone, mixed reality headsets, and with lots of brands getting in on the fun it's getting more and more important to be armed with the knowledge of which one is right for you. Unless you have thousands to splash out on one, there are two rivals duking it out for the top spot, the Pico 4 Ultra, and the Meta Quest 3. Squaring off for this Saturday night blockbuster fight are two headsets that can offer a lot of versatility. Whether you just want one of the best VR headsets for immersive gaming, you want spatial computing power, or you want a fun new way to enjoy some you-time without distractions, the Pico 4 Ultra and Meta Quest 3 are great products for you to consider. Although the Meta Quest 3 is much more commonly known, you shouldn't count the underdog out early. The Pico 4 isn't available in US markets, so that does take it out of contention for a lot of readers. Still, if you're anywhere else in the world, the Pico 4 Ultra is an extremely formidable opponent for Meta's Quest 3, and may even top it in certain aspects. There's a multi-round battle ahead of us, so grab your popcorn and get ready for a classic. Zuck's Meta Quest 3 is off to a raring start, as we all suspected. The Pico 4 Ultra just hasn't turned up in this opening round. Since the Quest 3 is available at so many retailers in the US and UK, it's the clear winner here. The Pico 4 Ultra is available in the UK though, and although I've seen it dip out of stock just once since its release, I'd say it's probably the harder of the two headsets to come across. As it continues to age, the Quest 3 is likely to get more discounts, bundles, and deals too. Let's not forget that the Meta Quest 3 comes in a few different variations too. The Pico 4 Ultra has one 256GB SKU, whereas the Quest 3 has its 512GB model, the 3S 128GB model, and the 3S 256GB model as well. The Quest 3 did have a more affordable 128GB version, but that's since been discontinued now that the 3S headsets are here. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Winner: Meta Quest 3 This is the round where things get interesting. After a near knockout in that first round, Pico 4 Ultra seems to have woken up, and we've got a real fight on our hands. On paper, the Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra have very similar specs. They both share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which in fighting terms is equivalent to having the same coach. In short, you're going to get very similar experiences with both of these devices, and there isn't much that separates them. Pico 4 Ultra Meta Quest 3 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Resolution 2160 x 2160 per eye 2064 x 2208 per eye Refresh rate 90Hz Variable - 72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz Field of View 105 degrees 110 degrees Sensors iTOF Depth sensor, Two MR cameras RGB cameras, 4 IR cameras Lenses Pancake Pancake Display 2 x LCD 2 x LCD Storage 256GB 512GB Cameras 2 x 32MB cameras 2x RGB 18PPD cameras Audio Integrated speakers Integrated 3D spatial audio speakers RAM 12GB LPDDR5 8GB Weight 580g 515g Eye Tracking None None Battery 5700mAh (2-4 hours depending on use) Up to 2.2 hours average Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, USB-C WiFi 6E, USB-C As you can see, it's a very close match-up to call between these two headsets. The tale of the tape has a lot of back and forth and a lot of things that are virtually the same, or cancel one another out. The Pico 4 Ultra has strengths in its Wi-Fi 7 support which means it'll be faster to install games and content. It also has 12GB of RAM up from 8GB in the Quest 3, which arguably futureproofs it more for more demanding VR games that have larger levels. RAM is really important in terms of VR computing power, so that's a huge win to have. The Pico 4 also does a great job of its crystal clear cameras and room tracking thanks to a depth sensor the Quest 3 doesn't have. The Quest 3 has more versatility when it comes to refresh rate, since depending on the application and what feels right for you, you can vary the frame rate of the headset from 72Hz to 90Hz, or even 120Hz. 110 degrees of horizontal field of view feels like a cheap win over the Pico 4 Ultra's 105, but it is a slight disparity. Storage also sits in the Quest 3's corner, although I'd argue this is less of a win in VR, since applications and games take up such a small amount of space compared to flat-screen games. Whatever Meta's been doing with audio has paid off though, and a big win for the Quest 3 comes in its quality of sound. While weight technically goes in Meta's favor too, I'd argue it's one of the specs that's virtually identical, for reasons I'll come onto. This is a tough round to call, but I think the wins that Pico 4 Ultra has in terms of its spec sheet are more significant strikes than the ones the Quest 3 can land. It's more about futureproofing in this arena, and the 12GB of RAM and increased Wi-Fi speed do make a big difference. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra (but not by much) If there's one disparity on the spec table that makes no sense, it's that the Meta Quest 3 weighs less than the Pico 4 Ultra. That's because the Pico 4 Ultra is designed to sit so comfortably on your face, and the way it distributes its weight across your head deserves a lot of credit. Longer sessions fly by while wearing this device, and that's down to some excellent design. A lot of that comes down to the fact that Pico's headstrap is much more substantial than Meta's. It reminds me of the one used for the Meta Quest Pro, and it feels like better value for money than the very simple material strap you get with the Quest 3. On the other hand, the best Meta Quest accessories do allow you to personalize your device to suit the comfort and weight distribution you'd like, so it's not a total walkover in this round. I'd argue this is a nice parry, but not an ideal counter since accessories demand more money on top of the headset. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra This one is another complicated round, and it's a bit of a shame, really. The Meta Quest 3 launched in October of 2023 and its 512GB SKU landed a lofty price tag of $649 / £619. The Pico 4 Ultra then launched just under a year later, and with a 256GB storage capacity that fit between the Quest 3's two models in price while touting some beefier specs. It launched to the tune of £529 in the UK, coming in comfortably under the Quest 3's larger 512 variant and making an excellent name for itself in the process. As an underdog, it really felt as though this was going to be a necessary move to win favor among VR shoppers who knew Meta's Quest brand well. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before things turned sour for Pico. The Quest 3S devices launched at $299 / £299 for 128GB, and $349 / £349 for 256GB. The Quest 3 128GB model was discontinued, and the 512GB Quest 3 received a price drop down to $499 / £469. It feels like a low blow has been struck to the underdog Pico 4 Ultra while the referee wasn't looking, and the Quest 3 has a smug look on its face as it walks back to the corner. Winner: Meta Quest 3 One of the biggest slights I hear against the Pico headsets is that they don't have access to the number of games that the Quest 3 has, and while that is true, it really isn't as bad as you think. A lot of the VR heavy hitters are still available on both headsets and if this is really a concern for you, maybe check to see if your favorite games are exclusive to one or the other before purchasing. You may find like I did, that the list the Pico 4 Ultra misses out on isn't actually that long. Both have access to Steam Link and can be hooked up to a gaming PC, so if you plan to tether to a beefier machine that can access SteamVR's library of games, both will do you just fine. Meta's Horizon OS does tend to be the first one to be thought of, however, so who knows what the future may hold as it likely continues to become the larger platform. Winner: Meta Quest 3 This one is slightly subjective, but from testing both headsets extensively and going through the process of reviewing them, I'd argue the Pico 4 Ultra is the better gaming device. It's a comfier headset that again, thanks to that weight distribution, extra RAM, and better depth sensing, makes immersive gaming experiences so much richer. There are fewer technical stutters that remind you you're running a standalone device through its paces, controllers track a bit more consistently, and in all honesty, I noticed more visual detail in Pico 4 Ultra games. At the same time, the visual fidelity on both headsets is virtually identical since their lenses, resolutions, displays, and FOVs are so close to one another. Meta Quest 3 has better passthrough quality since, for some reason, you can clearly read content on other screens better, but either will give you great passthrough quality. I'd say one of the big difference makers in this department is the controllers, which on the Pico 4 Ultra, are just that little bit better. They're marginally longer than the Quest 3 and have a few extra buttons, and it's amazing the difference this makes in games like Blade and Sorcery. Then again, the Quest 3 has some really polished hand-tracking features these days, if that's your thing. I think the motion trackers that come with Pico's device do add a lot more potential for immersive gaming experiences though. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra It's been an exhausting fight for the ages. Both combatants have come away bloody, beaten up, and bruised, and while neither has scored a decisive victory, there can only be one champion. I think the Pico 4 Ultra is, in a lot of ways, a better headset than the Quest 3. It feels a lot more tilted toward power users and those who want a futureproofed device that'll be able to run demanding VR games without compromise for years to come. It feels designed to counter some of the worst parts of the Quest 3. It's comfortable without the need for extra accessories, and its controllers aren't so small they lose tracking capability. Its software offering isn't as limited as some make it seem, and there's a lot of potential to use it in versatile ways, like any mixed-reality device today. It is hugely limited by its reluctance to enter the US market, however, and it's a shame we probably won't see a direct fight on the shelves between such close rivals. The Quest 3, thanks to its accessibly priced Quest 3S models, does a lot to bring VR technology into the mainstream limelight. In this day and age, it's the affordable, versatile, and genuinely capable VR device to own. In other words, the Quest 3 wins, but only because it had a home advantage.

BlackRock-backed CTV advertising platform MNTN is divesting production shop Maximum Effort “to an affiliate of its original owner,” according to an IPO securities filing made Friday. Maximum Effort was founded by actor Ryan Reynolds and producer George Dewey in 2018. In the filing, MNTN said that on Feb. 28 “the Company entered into an agreement to transfer its interest in Maximum Effort to an affiliate of its original owner.” Whether the indicated “affiliate” is Reynolds, Dewey, or a third party is unclear. Reynolds currently serves as chief creative officer for MNTN. Neither MNTN nor Maximum Effort responded to requests for comment by press time. Maximum Effort, which has produced splashy ads for Match.com, Peloton, and Mint Mobile, “will continue to provide creative services” to MNTN, per the agreement. In short, Maximum Effort will begin operating as an independent organization but will remain a creative partner for MNTN. The transaction is expected to close on April 1. MNTN acquired Maximum Effort in 2021 for an undisclosed sum. Citing strong revenue growth, the SEC filing also spells out MNTN’s plan for a U.S. IPO. The company saw revenue climb nearly 28% in 2024, up from $176 million in the prior year. The Texas-based firm plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker MNTN.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-4.43%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+0.85%) and Broadcom (AVGO+2.22%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.15%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT+1.99%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+2.02%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Texas-based AST SpaceMobile is laying the groundwork to deliver satellite-to-phone services across Europe amid growing competition with SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system. British carrier Vodafone, a major investor in AST, is working with the company to establish a "jointly owned European satellite service business" designed to serve mobile carriers in Europe. The joint venture, dubbed SatCo, promises to supply “100% geographic coverage in every part of Europe” to both consumers and businesses through their local mobile carriers, the companies said in the announcement. They're also emphasizing that “SatCo’s solution will fully support European digital sovereignty,” giving countries control over the data that flows through AST’s emerging satellite network. AST is preparing to operate dozens of so-called “BlueBird” satellites that can act as cell towers in space. But in Europe, SatCo is going to build the ground stations and network backhaul to feed and route the data to the BlueBird satellites. “Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality,” says AST CEO Abel Avellan. The European Union has been trying to develop its own satellite internet systems without relying on SpaceX’s Starlink, which has also been expanding into mobile connectivity. Separately, the EU is investing $11 billion to create a satellite internet service called IRIS² to supply high-speed broadband to governments, businesses, and consumers. In contrast, the Vodafone and AST deal is focused on mobile phones, enabling European carriers to deliver a satellite service to handsets, without any hardware modifications. Last month, Vodafone demoed the technology by using the BlueBird satellites to power a video call from a remote region in Wales that lacked traditional cell coverage. AST is also partnering with AT&T and Verizon to deliver the same capabilities to users in the US, giving consumers a way to receive connectivity in cellular dead zones. The big question is when AST can commercially launch the service. The Texas-based company has only sent five BlueBird satellites into orbit when it needs at least 45 to 60 to provide continuous coverage to users on the ground. Still, Vodafone expects the satellites to deliver the space-based mobile broadband across Europe “during 2025 and 2026.” Meanwhile, SpaceX is already operating close to 500 cellular Starlink satellites in orbit, which have begun powering SMS messaging to T-Mobile phones as part of a beta program. T-Mobile plans on officially kicking off the service in July by selling access to both its own subscribers and to customers on other carriers, including AT&T and Verizon. The cellular Starlink service will also arrive for carriers in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. But in Europe, SpaceX seems to have only reached deals with a local carrier in Ukraine and another carrier in Switzerland. I've been working as a journalist for over 15 years—I got my start as a schools and cities reporter in Kansas City and joined PCMag in 2017. I've been following SpaceX's Starlink network for several years, writing 500+ stories on availability and feature launches, but also the regulatory battles over the expansion of satellite constellations, fights between rival providers, and the effort to expand into satellite-based mobile service.

Intel’s stock is rising — and this time it’s not because of sale rumors Listen (2 min) Listen (2 min) Intel Corp. shares surged 22% in February, partly on hopes that the chip maker could engage in a sale of all or parts of its business. But Intel’s stock INTC was moving higher on Monday for a different reason, and one that has more to do with the company’s actual business. Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Broadcom Inc. AVGO are testing out the company’s 18A manufacturing technology. About the Author Emily Bary is MarketWatch's assistant managing editor, tech. She is based in New York.

Title: What 5 charts say about the pandemic’s impact, 5 years later

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The industry may be far from the dramatic day-to-day struggles of 2020, but it hasn’t yet escaped the long tail the global health crisis left in its wake. The pandemic may have hit retail five years ago, but its impacts came in wave after relentless wave for months after that. Immediate, dramatic effects — including widespread staff furloughs and the temporary closure of entire store footprints — gave way to longer-term challenges as supply chain chaos swept the industry. Government-funded stimulus payments, handed out to ease consumers’ pain, boosted spending, but left long-tail impacts that are still hurting retailers today. A lot of stimulus money ended up in the retail sector, which meant the industry “really ballooned” during the pandemic, according to Coresight Research’s head of global research, John Mercer. “One point we've made repeatedly is that consumers, we think, still haven't ceded what they've spent,” Mercer said, referring to the increased levels of spending shoppers adopted during that time. “But then, of course, the long-term effects of that stimulus is fueling inflation, which then obviously is challenging for consumers.” The rise of inflation also coincided with the depletion of many shoppers’ pandemic-era savings. The result? Shoppers pulled back on discretionary purchases, particularly in those categories that they overspent on while stuck inside. That’s led to the past two years of declines and stagnation in categories like home, which in turn has fueled bankruptcies, even years after COVID stopped being a regular word on the public’s lips. “We're certainly closer to the end, and there's a couple of data points that you can look to that would support that idea,” Declan Gargan, retail director at S&P Global Ratings, told Retail Dive. One of those is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which measures shopper spend on goods versus services. According to that data, the pandemic-era shift towards physical goods, which has remained elevated for several years, has swung back almost entirely to its pre-pandemic share of shoppers’ wallets. “Exiting 2024, it's pretty close,” Gargan said. Mercer believes there’s still a ways to go before discretionary spending normalizes, especially because services like travel were gaining more and more share annually before the pandemic hit. A recent report from real estate firm JLL also expects service-based tenants will account for more retail leases in the coming years, in what it says is an acceleration of a decade-long shift. That suggests the long-tail trends from COVID might still be with us a while longer. “If that balance swings back to how it was before the pandemic, there's still that potential for a multiyear trend to continue in terms of services gaining at the expense of goods,” Mercer said. Still, many of the strongest impacts from the pandemic are finally starting to show up in the rear-view mirror. Here’s a closer look at some of the long-tail impacts from the global health emergency, and what they say about how the industry has recovered. The threat of e-commerce replacing physical retail circulated for years prior to the moment the pandemic forced the issue. Amazon and the rise of e-commerce made regular appearances in bankruptcy documents, with retailers declaring themselves incapable of adjusting fast enough to the shifts in consumer shopping behavior. Then 2020 happened and retailers had to adapt — or risk losing out on sales of any kind. Improving websites and services like buy online, pick up in store became critical investments across the industry as cautious consumers avoided stores even after the initial pandemic scare was over. Unlike other areas of retail that boomed in 2020, though, e-commerce growth has yet to stagnate. According to Gargan, U.S. retail e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales (excluding automotive) had reached roughly 22% as of Q4 last year. That’s compared to roughly 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at the U.S. Commerce Department’s monthly numbers, e-commerce sales in December 2024 were more than $60 billion higher than they were five years previously, a 66% gain in that time period. “We think really it's going to be the larger retailers that benefit — the ones that have the resources, that have been making investments in capital spending, strengthening their digital capabilities,” Gargan said. “They're going to take that growing share and that's a trend that we expect to continue. But that might have been accelerated in terms of consumers adopting online shopping, because they were essentially forced to in the early days.” The idea that stores will be replaced by e-commerce is still nowhere near the truth, but Mercer noted that there is more of an emphasis on where physical retail can prove its worth. The way Coresight Research views it, stores should provide convenience, collection services (as in the picking up of orders), discount offerings or be a destination for shoppers. “There are places where stores can fill in those gaps around e-commerce and digital if they focus on some of those,” Mercer said. Even so, the growth curve of e-commerce may be tapering off soon. A report from FTI Consulting last year suggested the channel was “maturing” and that it would plateau around 35% in the next decade. That still leaves about 12 percentage points of share for e-commerce to take in the coming years, per FTI’s estimate, and new entrants are also making the space more competitive. “Shein and Temu, collectively worldwide, generated sales of over $100 billion last year,” Mercer said. “Now a minority of that is in the U.S., so that's not all coming from U.S. retailers, but a chunk of it is coming from the U.S. — and those are coming predominantly from legacy retailers.” In fact, Mercer said the impact of these competitive challenges on retailers is an “underrecognized story” in the industry, perhaps sidelined given widespread policy changes and consumer sentiment concerns. All of those macro issues are leading to more pressure on legacy retailers, and heavy predictions for store closings in 2025. Numerically, 2020 was a lighter year for store closures than 2019. And 2025 could be worse than both. Partially, that’s because Coresight Research’s store count numbers are based on permanent closures and openings, which leaves out the rash of temporary store closures that swept the world in 2020. But it’s also because 2020, though bad for many retailers, also led fairly swiftly to an influx of stimulus money for shoppers, which meant more spending — and fewer closures. As a result, both 2021 and 2022 saw significantly lower store closings across the industry, with 2022 marking the lowest number since 2012, Mercer said. “And then it kind of got worse from there,” Mercer said. Store closures in 2023, for example, were the worst since 2020 — until last year surpassed them. “So these things, I think, tend to come in waves.” Openings, on the other hand, have stayed incredibly consistent over the years. That may be because the same types of retailers reliably open stores year after year, including dollar stores, grocery stores and off-price retailers. When it comes to closures, though, pandemic-era stimulus money kicked off a boom in consumer spending, which then contracted due to inflation and other pressures. Now we’re seeing the impacts of that subdued spending in an aggressive store closure prediction for 2025. Coresight Research’s expectation — that 15,000 locations could shutter this year — would equate to a 55% increase over 2020’s count, and would more than double last year’s total. But there’s reason for it. Party City ended 2024 by outlining plans to shutter its entire 700-plus store footprint, Joann’s recent announcement adds another 800-plus locations to the count and Big Lots and Macy’s are also pursuing hundreds of closures this year. “They're already piling up,” Mercer said. In addition to the lingering effects of the pandemic, a weak housing market and the overflow impacts of bankruptcies from last year, there are also increasing competitive pressures from the likes of Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. “In some cases, retailers need to slim down their estates — and I think we see that particularly for legacy sectors like department stores and drugstores,” Mercer said. For others, like those in bankruptcy, it’s often more about reducing their cost base. But the pandemic-era pressures causing bankruptcies in some sectors may finally be easing, which could spell lighter store closure numbers in future years. For the home space, the pandemic was a fairy tale turned horror story when the enormous sales gains fueled by stay-at-home orders largely dissipated, leaving retailers reeling from the sudden (and sustained) dropoff in revenue. That category wasn’t the only one hit by shopping behavior changes — electronics and outdoors purchases also boomed in the early days of the pandemic before facing a pullback as consumers moved on from their COVID-era needs. “The pandemic — it's still impacting how consumers shop, where they're shopping and what categories they're shopping for,” Gargan said. “If you think about it, today, the areas in retail that are the most pressured tend to be kind of the specialty retailers — the ones that are focusing on more discretionary-type merchandise — and particularly those that are largely focused on home-related categories.” S&P Global Ratings isn’t expecting a significant uplift in spending across retail this year, but the categories that have been hit the hardest may finally be reaching “trough levels,” Gargan noted. Wayfair leadership said as much in the retailer’s latest earnings call, with CEO Niraj Shah commenting that the e-commerce company believes it’s reached “the bottom of this downcycle” in the home market. Best Buy announced falling electronics sales would reach the end of that cycle in 2023 — and indeed, monthly sales in the sector in 2024 were largely flat or up compared to the year prior — but not at Best Buy, which continued to see sales declines. And crafts and outdoor retailers, which are counted under the same category by the Commerce Department, continue to struggle through lackluster sales trends as well. Those pressures have led to two Joann bankruptcies in roughly a year, layoffs at the likes of REI and Patagonia, and even pullback from Dick’s Sporting Goods on its outdoors ambitions. “To really see an inflection or catalyst that would support sales growth, there's got to be some macro factors that change — and that's principally lower interest rates, bringing mortgage rates down, starting to see improving housing turnover,” Gargan said of the home space. Spaces like electronics could also start to benefit from the product renewal cycle, according to Mercer, as shoppers look to replace the laptops or TVs they bought five years ago. “We've possibly reached, or gone past, the kind of dip in stuff — ‘Oh, well, I bought it during the pandemic. I don't need it anymore,’” Mercer said. “Because five years on, things change. Things wear out. You move house — whatever.” Until sales trends fully recover from the peaks and valleys brought on by COVID, distressed retailers will still be citing the pandemic as a major driver in bankruptcy filings — and according to Gargan, many of them have reason to. “It really wasn't a precipitous dropoff, a one-year period,” Gargan said of the pandemic. “It was really kind of these incremental effects.” There was the pull forward in demand, then the supply chain disruptions, then inflation and higher interest rates. “I think those are all — you can kind of tie that back to the pandemic to some degree,” Gargan said. “And so in that regard, I think it is a fair characterization.” 2020 itself was still an enormous year for bankruptcy filings, as many retailers stopped being able to afford rent without any foot traffic to their stores, but the same trends that kept store closures at bay in 2021 and 2022 played out in bankruptcy filings. Now, faced with the reversal of those behaviors, things have ticked up again. Of the five traditional retailers that defaulted in some fashion last year, the “vast majority” cited the pandemic as a contributing cause, Gargan said of S&P Global Ratings’ data. Four of those five defaults were Chapter 11 filings, he added, which suggests lenders are less willing to negotiate with struggling retailers outside of bankruptcy court. S&P Global Ratings marked 34 bankruptcies in the consumer discretionary and retail markets overall last year. Joann is an interesting example. The retailer closed no stores during its first bankruptcy and is now liquidating its entire 800-plus footprint during its second one after a group including the retailer’s lenders won a bankruptcy auction for the company. “The relationship with their vendors, I think, was impaired beyond their expectations,” Gargan said, noting that suppliers started tightening terms prior to Joann’s first bankruptcy. “I think those issues persisted longer than Joann expected. I think they expected them to be resolved once they exited Chapter 11 the first go around.” With pandemic-driven bankruptcies and closures in 2020 also came meaningful job loss — and surges in hiring as stores reopened and shoppers returned. Layoffs in 2020 more than doubled from 2019, while hiring was up 33%. But ever since then, hiring (and, for the most part, layoffs) have been much more muted. In fact, hiring declined for three consecutive years after 2020 — and in 2024, hiring totals were nearly 40% lower than they were in 2019. Layoffs, after hitting a high of about 185,000 in 2020, were extraordinarily low for two years before popping back up to 2019 levels in 2023. Last year, layoffs were down almost 50%, though still significantly higher than retail’s stimulus-fueled years. “Whether your category is performing better than others, issuers are all facing the same elevated inflationary costs on their business — and so they're looking for ways to offset that,” Gargan said, noting that tariffs and freight rates pose uncertainties for retailers this year. Workforce reductions, like store closures, is one of the ways retailers can trim costs. In a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report earlier this year, the outplacement firm noted that retail jobs have “fundamentally changed” and require different skills than they did in the 2010s. In an email to Retail Dive, Senior Vice President Andy Challenger acknowledged the impact of the pandemic on retailers, but hinted that other forces are now at play. “The pandemic seemed to have permanently shifted how retailers staff and operate, but we've entered a new era where economic uncertainty and falling consumer confidence are driving decision-making,” Challenger said.

Title: 1900 Scientists Say ‘Climate Change Not Caused by CO2’ – The Real Environment Movement Was Hijacked

Millions of people worldwide are concerned about climate change and believe there is a climate emergency. For decades we have been told by the United Nations that Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from human activity are causing disastrous climate change. In 2018, a UN IPCC report even warned that ‘we have 12 years to save the Earth’, thus sending millions of people worldwide into a frenzy. Thirty-five years ago, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the (World Meteorological Organization) WMO established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide scientific advice on the complex topic of climate change. The panel was asked to prepare, based on available scientific information, a report on all aspects relevant to climate change and its impacts and to formulate realistic response strategies. The first assessment report of the IPCC served as the basis for negotiating the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Governments worldwide have signed this convention, thereby, significantly impacting the lives of the people of the world. However, many scientists dispute with the UN-promoted man-made climate change theory, and many people worldwide are confused by the subject, or are unaware of the full facts. Please allow me to provide some information you may not be aware of. 1. Very few people actually dig into the data, they simply accept the UN IPPC reports. Yet many highly respectable and distinguished scientists have done exactly that and found that the UN-promoted manmade climate change theory is seriously flawed. Are you aware that almost 2,000 of the world’s leading climate scientists and professionals in over 30 countries have signed a declaration that there is no climate emergency and have refuted the United Nations claims in relation to man-made climate change? See this. 2. I have also signed this declaration. How can I make such an assertion? I have experience in the field as a former scientist at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, UK Government; and as former staff member at United Nations Environment, where I was responsible for servicing the Pollution Release and Transfer Register Protocol, a Multinational Environmental Agreement, involving the monitoring of pollutants to land, air, and water worldwide. Real pollution exists, but the problem is not CO2. Industrial globalisation has produced many substances that are registered as pollutants, including thousands of new man-made chemical compounds, toxins, nano-particles and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that are in violation of the scientific pre-cautionary principle. A book I published also provides ample evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no ‘CO2-induced’ Climate emergency. The book titled ‘Climate CO2 Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement’ is available on Amazon here. 3. Next, I will mention the Irish Climate Science Forum (ICSF) website, a valuable resource founded by Jim O’Brien. I am grateful to the ICSF for their excellent work in highlighting the scientific flaws in the UN climate narrative. The ICSF provides a comprehensive lecture series from renowned international scientists providing much evidence, analysis, and data that contradicts the UN assertions. The lectures are available here. The ICSF scientific view coincides with those of the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation that operates in the fields of climate change and climate policy. CLINTEL was founded in 2019 by emeritus professor of geophysics Guus Berkhout and science journalist Marcel Crok. Based on this common conviction, 20 Irish scientists and several ICSF members have co-signed the CLINTEL World Climate Declaration “There is No Climate Emergency” (see this). 4. The reality is that the climate has always been changing, the climate changes naturally and slowly in its own cycle, and CO2 emissions (and methane from livestock, such as cows) are not dominant factors in climate change. In essence, therefore, the incessant UN, government, and corporate-media-produced climate hysteria in relation to CO2 emissions (and also methane from cows) has no scientific basis. It appears to me the UN narrative is yet another example of fake science being used to drive an ulterior agenda, see also the book Godless Fake Science. In truth I am against ‘real’ pollution, and the reality is that the CO2 component is not a pollutant. Unfortunately, many misinformed environmentalists are driving around in electric cars, the battery production for which has caused vast amounts of ‘real’ pollution via the industrial mining and processing of rare earth metals, and the consequent pollution to land, air and water systems. See also this article. Note that the UN does not focus on the thousands of real pollutants that corporate industrial globalisation creates. 5. The conclusions of the Climate Intelligence foundation include the following There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming: The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming. Warming is far slower than predicted: The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by IPCC on the basis of modeled anthropogenic forcing. The gap between the real world and the modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change. Climate policy relies on inadequate models: Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as global policy tools. They blow up the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial. CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth: CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide. Global warming has not increased natural disasters: There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. It also appears to me that various catastrophes attributed to “CO2-induced climate change” are nothing of the sort. I note the following articles: 6. In the above book I reference the relevant work and scientific presentations of some of the world’s leading climate scientists. Let us examine some of the work and testimonies of these scientists: “deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that Co2 from human industry was a dangerous plant destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that Co2 the life of plants was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” – Professor Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT. Dr Nils-Axel Mörner was a former Committee Chairman at the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He was an expert involved in reviewing the first IPPC documents. He says the UN IPPC is misleading humanity about climate change. He tried to warn that the IPPC were publishing lies and false information that would inevitably be discredited. In an interview, he stated: “This is the most dangerous and frightening part of it. How a lobbyist group, such as the IPPC, has been able to fool the whole world. These organised and deceitful forces are dangerous” and expressed shock “that the UN and governments would parade children around the place at UN Climate summits as propaganda props”. He states: “solar activity is the dominant factor in climate and not Co2… something is basically sick in the blame Co2 hypothesis… It was launched more than 100 years ago and almost immediately excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work. I was the chairman of the only international committee on sea levels changes and as such a person I was elected to be the expert reviewer on the (UN IPPC) sea levels chapter. It was written by 38 persons and not a single one was a sea level specialist… I was shocked by the low quality it was like a student paper… I went through it and showed them that it was wrong and wrong and wrong…The scientific truth is on the side of the sceptics… I have thousands of high ranked scientists all over the world who agree that NO, CO2 is not the driving mechanism and that everything is exaggerated. In the field of physics 80 to 90% of physicists know that the Co2 hypothesis is wrong… Of course, metrologists they believe in this because that is their own profession – they live on it.… I suspect that behind-the-scenes promoters… have an ulterior motive… It’s a wonderful way of controlling taxation controlling people” – Dr Nils-Axel Mörner, a former Committee Chairman at the UN IPPC, and former head of the Paleo Geo-physics and Geo-dynamics department in Stockholm Another climate scientist with impeccable credentials that has broken rank is Dr Mototaka Nakamura. He asserts: “Our models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world”. Dr Nakamura received a Doctorate of Science from MIT, and for nearly 25 years specialized in abnormal weather and climate change at prestigious institutions that included MIT, Georgia Institute of Technology, NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, JAMSTEC and Duke University. Dr Nakamura explains why the data foundation underpinning global warming science is “untrustworthy” and cannot be relied on and that: “Global mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data”. Professor John R. Christy, Director of Atmospheric and Earth Sciences, University of Alabama, has provided detailed analysis of climate data[1]. I summarise the main points from his analysis below: “The established global warming theory significantly misrepresents the impact of extra greenhouse gases; the weather that affects people the most is not becoming more extreme or more dangerous; temperatures were higher in the 1930s than today; between 1895 and 2015, 14 of the top 15 years with the highest heat records occurred before 1960; the temperatures we are experiencing now in 2021 were the same as 120 years ago… the number of major tornadoes between 1954 and 1986 averaged 56/year, but between 1987 and 2020 the average was only 34/year; between 1895 and 2015 on average there has been no change in the number of very wet days per month, and no change in the number of very dry days per month, and the 20 driest months were before 1988. Between 1950 and 2019 the percentage of land area experiencing droughts has not increased globally – the trend is flat; the incidence of wildfires in North America between 1600 and 2000 has decreased substantially. Sea levels rose 12.5 cm per decade for 8,000 years and then it levelled off, now it rising only 2.5 cm per decade… worrying about 30 cm rise in sea level in a decade is ridiculous, in a hurricane the east coast of the U.S. gets a 20 foot rise in 6 hours, so a 30 cm rise will be easily handled!” In a lecture titled The imaginary climate crisis – how can we change the message? Available on the Irish Climate Science Forum website[2]. Richard L Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT summarises the battle against the climate hysteria as follows: “in the long history of the earth there has been almost no correlation between climate and co2… the paleoclimate record shows unambiguously that Co2 is not a control knob… the narrative is absurd… it gives governments the power to control the energy sector… for about 33 years, many of us have been battling against the climate hysteria… There were more important leading people who were objecting to it, they were unfortunately older and by now most of them dead… Elites are always searching for ways to advertise their virtue and assert their authority. They believe they are entitled to view science as a source of authority rather than a process, and they try to appropriate science, suitably and incorrectly simplified, as the basis for their movement.” “CO2… it’s not a pollutant… it’s the product of all plant respiration, it is essential for plant life and photosynthesis… if you ever wanted a leverage point to control everything from exhalation to driving, this would be a dream. So it has a kind of fundamental attractiveness to bureaucratic mentality.” – Prof. Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, and President of Greenpeace in Canada for seven years, states: “the whole climate crisis is not only fake news its fake science… of course climate change is real it’s been happening since the beginning of time, but it’s not dangerous and it’s not caused by people… climate change is a perfectly natural phenomenon and this modern warming period actually began about 300 years ago when the little ice age began to come to an end. There is nothing to be afraid of and all they are doing is instilling fear. Most of the scientists who are saying it’s a crisis are on perpetual government grants. I was one of the (Greenpeace) founders… by the mid-80s… we were hijacked by the extreme left who basically took Greenpeace from a science-based organisation to an organisation based on sensationalism, misinformation and fear… you don’t have a plan to feed 8 billion people without fossils fuels or get the food into the cities…” – Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace Professor William Happer, Princeton University, Former Director of Science at the US Department of Energy, is also a strong voice against the myth of man-made global warming. He states: “More CO2 benefits the Earth”. 7. The UN IPCC cherry picks data, uses flawed modelling and scenarios not remotely related to the real world The UN climate crisis predictions are not based on physical evidence, rather they are based on complex computer modelling. One has to decode and analyse the modelling process to ascertain whether or not the models are valid and accurate or whether they have obvious flaws. The vast majority of scientists, economists, politicians and the general public have simply assumed that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models are accurate. Very few people have the time or skills to analyse these models, not to mention actually dispute them. Nonetheless, there were many senior and highly distinguished scientists that did exactly that – they claimed the UN narrative was incorrect and that there was no climate emergency. Their voices have been drowned out by a vast money-driven political and media establishment of the globalised ‘system’. The vitally important work of some of these renowned scientists is referenced in the above book. “The computer models are making systematic dramatic errors… they are all parametrised… fudged… the models really don’t work” – Patrick J. Michaels, Director, Cato Institute Center for the Study of Science Dr Roger Pielke Jr, University of Colorado, has conducted a detailed scientific review and analysis of the UN IPCC AR6 report[3]. He describes that in relation to climate modelling, the IPCC detached the models from socio-economic plausibility. In creating the models, instead of first completing integrative assessment models (IAMs), the IPCC skipped this essential step and jumped straight to radiative forcing scenarios and thus these scenarios are not based on competed IAMs. This led much of climate modelling down the wrong track. I quote points from Dr Pielke’s analysis as follows: “The four IPCC scenarios came from a large family of models so instead of splitting modelling from socio-economic assumptions the models already had the assumptions faked and baked in to them, because they had to have those assumptions to produce the required radiative forcing (to produce a desired climate ‘crisis scenario’ outcome). In another fateful decision the 4 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) came from 4 different IAMs, which was a huge mistake. These models are completely unrelated to each other, but the impression has been given that they are of a common set, only differing in their radiative forcing, this was a huge mistake. Furthermore, no-one has responsibility for determining whether these scenarios are plausible. The climate community decided which scenario to prioritise and they chose the two most implausible scenarios! There are thousands of climate assumptions, but only 8 to 12 of them are available currently for climate research. The IPCC report even states that “no likelihood is attached to the scenarios in this report”. The likelihood is considered low they admit – This is an incredible admission by the IPCC. These extreme unlikely scenarios dominate the literature and the IPCC report; therefore, the IPCC report is biased. Bottom line is that there is massive confusion. The IPCCs’ Richard Moss warned that RCP 8.5 was not to be used as a reference for the other RCPs, but 5,800 scientific papers worldwide misuse it like that… The whole process is seriously flawed… Nothing close to the real world is represented by the IPCC scenarios. Climate science has a huge problem! The IPCC currently uses RCP 8.5 as the ‘business as usual’ scenario, but RCP 8.5 is wild fantasy land and not remotely related to current reality at all… climate science has a scientific integrity crisis.” – Dr Roger Pielke Jr, University of Colorado 8. Financialization of the entire world economy is now based on a life-killing ‘net-zero’ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. The UN Agenda 2030 plan and the Paris Agreement goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% per annum until 2030 is in effect a plan that would seemingly disable the current fossil-fuel-based mechanisms of the industrial economy for the food, energy and goods that enable human life and survival. Yet the narrative is quite hypocritical as the production of green energy infrastructure, and mining of rare earth metals for batteries for electric vehicles, is, and will most likely continue to be, very fossil-fuel intensive. Globalisation resulted in much of humanity becoming largely dependent on the trans-national industrial economy rather than on traditional more self-sufficient local/regional economies. Therefore, one has to ask where is this all going to lead if the plug is truly pulled on fossil fuels? Almost all of us are seemingly locked into, and have become dependent upon, the current economic paradigm of globalisation. A system rigged by debt-money created from nothing; created and controlled by private mega-banks and behind the scenes money-masters; and which can induce boom, bust, bailout scenarios that detrimentally effect the populace. It should be noted that for decades, these same political, government, and corporate powers have rampantly promoted corporate economic globalization and fossil fuel dependency. Whilst, at the same time actively hindering the funding, creation, or government support of, more self-sufficient local communities/regions, and local co-operatives. Most of the world population thus became reliant on the globalized fossil-fuel driven system. I explore this topic in the books Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability Zero carbon emissions, in essence, means pulling the plug on current systems of industrial agriculture, transport, goods production, electricity production, etc. This could have terrible consequences, particularly in locations and countries, that are currently unable to produce much food. In Ireland, the deluded greens in government had planned to close the coal-fired power station Moneypoint, in the name of reducing CO2 emissions. However, as the price of electricity increased and the dawn of so-called ‘green energy’ began to evaporate like the Irish morning mist, the government scrapped this plan in 2022, instead deciding to convert the station to an oil-burning facility. The Irish Times newspaper reported: “With growing concerns over security of the energy supply in the State, the Government is not in a position to decommission Moneypoint as a fuel-burning station in the near future. It was confirmed by the Irish Government in 2022 that Moneypoint will convert to oil generation from 2023.”[4] The so-called ‘green economy’ (for it is not environmentally friendly in reality) and UN Agenda 2030 are resulting in increased energy poverty and decreased energy independence for the masses, while also developing trillions of dollars for the behind-the-scenes mega-banks. “Stop burning coal and wood logs that causes climate change don’t ya know” my deluded neighbour informed me last year, having threw out her wood burning stove and installed solar panels. Then a typical winter storm in Ireland last month left many thousands of people without electricity or heating for almost a week, shivering and wishing for a wood burning stove, while their solar panels produced little electricity in winter. 9. Central bankers are entirely funding / controlling the advancement of the worldwide climate change ‘project’ The decision to drastically reduce CO2, one of the most essential compounds to sustain all life, is no co-incidence. It should be noted that it is the world’s central bankers that are behind this decision and are entirely funding and controlling the advancement of the worldwide project of ‘combatting man-made climate-change’. This project involves an attempt to de-carbonise the activities of the entire world population. In December 2015, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which represents $118 trillion of assets globally[5]. In essence this means that the financialization of the entire world economy is based on meeting nonsensical aims such as “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. The TCFD includes key people from the world’s mega-banks and asset management companies, including JP Morgan Chase; BlackRock; Barclays Bank; HSBC; China’s ICBC bank; Tata Steel, ENI oil, Dow Chemical, and more. The fact that the world’s largest banks and asset management corporations, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, the UN, the World Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks of the BIS, have all linked to push a vague, mathematically nonsensical ‘green’ economy, is no coincidence. There is another agenda at play that has nothing to do with environmentalism. When the world largest banks, corporations, and institutions, all align to push a climate change agenda that has zero evidence, one can see there is another major agenda going on behind the scenes. This agenda tries to convince the common people of the world to make huge sacrifices under the emotive guise of “saving our planet.”. While all the time the corporations and banks make vast profits, and political institutions implement worldwide technocratic control systems under the banner of combatting, and adapting to, so-called man-made climate change. “The links between the world’s largest financial groups, central banks and global corporations to the current push for a radical climate strategy to abandon the fossil fuel economy in favor of a vague, unexplained Green economy, it seems, is less about genuine concern to make our planet a clean and healthy environment to live. Rather it is an agenda, intimately tied to the UN Agenda 2030 for “sustainable” economy, and to developing literally trillions of dollars in new wealth for the global banks and financial giants who constitute the real powers that be… “ – F. William Engdahl, strategic risk consultant and lecturer Back in 2010, the head of Working Group 3 of the UN IPCC, Dr Otmar Edenhofer, told an interviewer, “…one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.” To better perceive what is ‘behind the curtain’ of the climate hoax and the UN/WEF agenda it also helps to examine what has happened in the decades beforehand. It is important to perceive the implications of the worldwide fractional-reserve debt-money banking scam and the subtle system of debt-slavery that has existed for decades. If you look at the World Bank website you will see that virtually every nation on Earth is in vast debt. In debt to who you may ask? The answer is to privately owned mega-banks. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. For many decades the so-called banking and corporate elites have had full control of the source of money creation and its allocation, via the debt-money system, and have therefore, by default, been able to fund, and increasingly control and manipulate the entire world spectrum of industry, media, government, education, ideological supremacy and war to their own design, agenda and benefit. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (banker) is widely reported to have said: “Give me control of a nation’s money supply and I care not who makes its laws.” 10. Central bankers hijacked the real environmental movement in 1992 creating the fake climate change agenda Psychopaths can utilise any ideology and, change it from within to something that may eventually be entirely different to its original purpose. Meanwhile, the original followers and advocates continue to pursue what they believe is the original ideology, but gradually become mere pawns in the agenda of a self-serving elite. Unfortunately, over the past decades, this is exactly what has happened in the environmental movement. Whistleblower George Hunt served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in Denver, Colorado in 1987, and states that David Rockefeller; Baron Edmund De Rothschild; US Secretary of State Baker; Maurice Strong, a UN official and an employee of the Rockefeller and Rothschild trusts; EPA administrator William Ruccleshaus; UN Secretary General in Geneva MacNeill, along with World Bank and IMF officials were at this meeting. Hunt was surprised to see all these rich elite bankers at the meeting and questioned what they were doing there at an environmental congress. In a video recording available here Hunt later provided important evidence from the documents of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3-14 June 1992. This conference was the well-known UN ’92 Earth Summit and was run by UNCED. According to Hunt, via the Earth summit, the UN was setting a net, an agenda, to place the power over the Earth and its peoples into their own hands. The world private banking cartel are the same ultra-rich banking families that had been instrumental in the setting up of the World Bank, the UN, and other international institutions, after WW2. Their political cohorts included Stalin (the leader of a brutal communist regime in the USSR that committed genocide of millions of people), UK Prime minister Churchill, and US President Roosevelt. Hunt refers to these banking families and their financial and international institutional networks as: “The same world order that tricked third world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debts… and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control. The world order crowd are not a nice group of people…”– George Hunt, Whistleblower speaking about the UN Earth summit of 1992 As a consequence of the UN Earth Summit, it appears the genuine environment movement that actually cared about real pollution to land, air and water, was politically hi-jacked by powerful political and financial interests with a different agenda. Maurice Strong, a UN official and an employee of the Rockefeller and Rothschild trusts, had convened the first UNCED congress in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972. Then, 20 years later he was the convenor and secretary general of UNCED. Hunt also provided video evidence from the Fourth UNCED World Congress meeting in 1987 of an international investment banker, stating that: “I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process that would take too long and require far too much funds to educate the cannon-fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth. We have to take almost an elitist program…” Thus, the decrees leading to the 1992 UN Earth summit were dictated without debate or opportunity for dissent and would supersede national laws. According to Hunt, the decrees were dictated into existence by the banker Edmund de Rothschild, who got these major decrees into the ’92 UN resolutions without debate or challenge. Hunt asserts that he was denied the opportunity to openly challenge Rothschild’s remarks by the meeting Chairman; and that the Rothschild bank of Geneva is the nucleus of the World Conservation bank and the wealthy elite are integrated into the bank via the Rothschilds private offering of shares. 11. Despite the deceptive and fake environmental facade, it has adopted, the vast institutional entity of the UN has fully endorsed environmentally destructive industrial globalisation for the past 70 years. The UN climate change, sustainable development and green economy policies over the past 30 years are little more than worldwide marketing tricks that have tragically brainwashed two generations of young people who do not understand what the UN actually is, and who is it is really designed to serve. This current globalised system involves the promotion of beliefs and fake science that claim to be unchallengeable truths, but are, in fact, ideologies in which evidence is manipulated, twisted, and distorted to prove the ‘governing idea’, and thus promote its worldwide dissemination. They start with the conclusion they want and then wrench and manipulate what scant evidence they can to fit that conclusion. Man-made climate change due to anthropogenic carbon emission is a major example of this. Institutions, including the UN, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the World Health Organisation (WHO), are privately-motivated unelected unaccountable organisations controlled by the source of debt-money creation, i.e., the world private-banking cartel; and are just clever marketing tools and political mechanisms for implementing and maintaining a corrupt worldwide system, under the clever guise of ‘fixing the problems of the world’. These powerful special interests have been promoting certain ‘ideologies’ for decades to advance their corporate and political aims. The word “sustainable” was hijacked decades ago, and it is now deceptively used to advance the agendas of globalist mega-corporate interests who couldn’t care less about the environment. The aim is to catapult humanity into the arms of UN Agenda 2030 and the WEF ‘reset’ plan, which are clever marketing plans entirely designed by the so-called elite mega-corporate interests of the WEF Davos group. 12. Furthermore, the current green energy/renewable technologies being promoted by the UN and WEF, are not a viable solution for the world’s energy supply. Although these technologies have some limited viability in certain locations and scenarios, the fact remains that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested is much too low – in essence the entire process is mathematically flawed. This is evidenced by the work of scientists, including Professor David MacKay (1967 – 2016), former Regius Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University, and former Chief Scientific Advisor at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change. In summary, CO2 reduction is the main focus of the UN-promoted climate-change-hysteria that has been rampant among the world’s population. However, the proclaimed climate crisis exists in computer models only. The cult of ‘manmade climate change’ is a media and UN politically-promoted ‘ideology’, that is used for a wider political and corporate agenda. Manmade climate change is not based in fact, and has hijacked real environmental concerns. Due to incessant UN, government, and corporate-promoted climate change propaganda, many people are, thus, in a media-induced state of confusion, and, thus, blindly assume their pre-determined role in society under this ‘dictatorship of words’ without even being aware of it. The unpalatable reality is that people’s access to energy and resources is being intentionally reduced via bogus climate change policies, inflation, ongoing geo-political theatre and intentionally instigated war. We cannot understand how to create a truly resilient society unless we correctly perceive the current society we live in and how it came to exist. Unless we recognize the untruths of the current paradigm, even if it is not ‘politically correct’ to do so, then we will not be able to make the correct adjustments to our communities and local/regional networks, or create a truly resilient thriving society. In this spirit of truth, new networks are emerging worldwide. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Three AI stocks to buy if you want to look past the Nvidia hardware build-out Investor excitement over generative artificial intelligence continues to center on the installation of graphics-processing units (GPU) and related equipment by data centers, which support their corporate clients’ efforts to develop the new technology. Nvidia Corp. NVDA continues to dominate that market. But a long-term investor might be well served to think about what companies will actually do with the technology.

US-based Bitcoin ETFs lead record $2.9 billion outflow as global crypto products face pressure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Last week, the crypto market witnessed its most significant weekly sell-off, with outflows hitting a record $2.9 billion, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This marked the third consecutive week of capital exiting digital asset investment products, bringing total outflows to $3.8 billion. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, pointed out multiple reasons for the downturn. According to him, the recent security breach at Bybit, alongside a more assertive stance from the US Federal Reserve, contributed to weakened investor confidence that spurred capital withdrawals. Butterfill also noted that investors took profits following a 19-week inflow streak of $29 billion. Investors pulled $2.87 billion from US-based funds, dealing a significant blow to major spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers. CoinShares reported that BlackRock recorded $1.3 billion in withdrawals, while Fidelity lost over $569 million. Grayscale also faced steep exits, with $421 million leaving its funds. Other firms, including Bitwise and 21Shares, saw combined outflows surpassing $130 million. Outside the US, Switzerland and Canada saw net outflows of $73 million and $16.9 million, respectively. Germany, however, bucked the trend, attracting $55.3 million as investors maintained a bullish outlook. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s decline to a three-month low below $80,000 triggered a modest rise in short Bitcoin product inflows, which reached $2.3 million. Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, also faced a sharp sell-off, registering record weekly outflows of $300 million. Investment products in other digital assets, such as TON and Solana, also struggled, shedding $22.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Additionally, blockchain equities ETPs didn’t escape the negative sentiment, seeing $25.3 million outflows. However, despite the widespread sell-off, some assets attracted fresh capital. Sui led inflow, securing $15.5 million. XRP followed with a $5 million inflow, fueled by the continued speculation over a potential US spot XRP ETF and the belief that the digital asset is well-positioned for regulatory clarity under the Donald Trump administration.

What Nvidia’s market valuation says about where the stock will be in 5 years Listen (5 min) Listen (5 min) Nvidia Corp.’s market performance over the past six months is a good illustration of the difference between a good company and a good stock. Nvidia — the company — has performed phenomenally. Its cumulative earnings per share over the past two quarters were more than 800% higher than the comparable two-quarter total a year earlier. Yet Nvidia’s stock NVDA fell after the company’s earnings report last week. About the Author Mark Hulbert is a columnist for MarketWatch.

03/03 update below. This post was originally published on March 02 Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano have rocketed higher after Donald Trump revealed plans to create a U.S.-focused crypto reserve. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price shot toward $90,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s post, despite not initially being named as part of the planned U.S. crypto reserve. Ripple’s XRP and ethereum rivals solana and cardano—all regarded as U.S.-made cryptocurrencies—each rose between 20% and 50%. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has announced the creation of a crypto reserve, sending the price of ... [+] bitcoin, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano sharply higher. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano and without mentioning bitcoin. “I will make sure the U.S. is the crypto capital of the world. We are making America great again.” In a follow up post, Trump added: “Obviously, bitcoin and ethereum, other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the reserve. I also love bitcoin and ethereum.” 03/03 update: Bitcoin and crypto trader attention has now turned to the upcoming White House crypto summit, set for this coming Friday, in which influential crypto executives, founders and investors will meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets. “The announcement comes ahead of this Friday’s crypto summit at the White House. The timing means expectations going into Friday will be for something concrete,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research, said in emailed comments. A regulatory road map is expected, as well as more details on the crypto strategic reserve, with many analysts questioning how Donald Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve will work. “Yesterday’s proposal lacks details on size, timing, and whether it will be managed by the Federal Reserve or another new or existing entity,” Andrew O’Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings, said in emailed comments. “The Jan 23rd executive order only initiates the exploration of a digital asset reserve, with recommendations to follow.” David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, weighed in on criticism of the crypto reserve coming from Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale who had complained of tax dollars being used to fund "crypto bro schemes," posting: “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program. Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed," sparking speculation the U.S. strategic crypto reserve might involve holding seized assets rather than the U.S. buying more crypto to stock it. "More to come at the summit," Sacks added. “White House crypto czar David Sacks will shed more light on what is coming at the crypto summit set to take place on Friday,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive of crypto payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said via email. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market—including Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano—all surged following Trump’s election victory in November, climbing as traders bet he would follow through on his campaign promises to roll back Biden-era regulatory crackdowns on crypto markets and companies. “The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government’s engagement with the crypto industry,” Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rose sharply following Donald Trump's post, announcing he planned to create a ... [+] crypto reserve that includes Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano. Alongside plans to create a bitcoin reserve, Trump and his family—led by Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric—have been expanding their businesses into the world of bitcoin, crypto and blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi). In January, Trump and his wife Melania launched twin memecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that’s traded on community interest, which both surged before crashing back. Both memecoins are now trading down more than 80% from their all-time highs. The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that is expected to facilitate users earning yield through stablecoins and allow them to borrow bitcoin and crypto, also began buying up various cryptocurrencies, including the ethereum-based wrapped bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump’s social media company Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which runs the Truth Social platform and has recently announced its expanding into the world of crypto and finance, has taken steps toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—putting on course to compete with the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity.

Don't miss out on this fantastic deal! Grab yours today! Is this better then the anker737? Dunno, I'd rather just stick to my 90W charging on Xiaomi phone at the moment. There will always be a use case for power banks, but have to wonder if their utility will be diminished now that we're entering the age of silicon carbide batteries for devices I heard new battery tech is using nuclear? https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/nuclear-battery-betavolt-… At this point you'd need thousands of these to have even a chance to run a phone. Their output power is in the pico watt range. I assume you mean Silicon carbide lithium-ion batteries ? I'm not sure how they will diminish the need for on th go charging. This Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI offers advantages over the Anker 737, including higher total output power (212W vs 140W) and faster charging speeds (up to 120W). Fomo! grab it now:) we offer 7-day change of mind on our amazon shop Does it function like a UPS similar to the Xiaomi ZMI No.20? yes, it does Apparently the 120W maximum USB-A output requires a Xiaomi 6A Type-C fast charging cable. Is such a cable included in this package? This package include a USB-C to USB-C cable with E-marker, rated at 100W capacity. The 120W output would require a compatible Xiaomi phone and the cable came with the phone. @Mostly Melbourne: Aw. Last question - is the 100W USB A to C cable that came with the ZMI No. 20 compatible with the USB A output of this power bank? Would definitely buy if it is! @anonym: Yes, the 100W USB A to C cable that came with the ZMI No. 20 should be compatible with the USB A output of the Xiaomi Hyper Power Bank (212W, 25000mAh). This power bank also supports USB A output (up to 20V6A) using Xiaomi's charging protocol. Fyi, Just checked these sell for 364 chinese yuan (approx. $80 aud) on Pinduoduo app in HK. (similar to Temu). Free shipping? I think local shipping limited to HK. I had the app installed while traveling there. Bargain at aud80 ! Let me check temu now The product is an item that was previously returned, not in its original packaging, and it does not come with a one-year warranty or a seven-day no-reason return guarantee. Additionally, you need to consider the shipping cost from Hong Kong to Australia. *Slow shipping, its pretty much restricted to; A - Sea Freight B - Designated Courier Aircraft (ie. DHL) which can carry these sorts of batteries Isn't 1 year warranty default? Or are you extending it by 1 more year so it's 2yrs total? Australia customer law is above the manufacturer warranties. There is no default. You make you sell you decide all the features. I can sell something and give 1 hour warranty and free onlyfans account and one carrot cake, but I still have to follow Australian law when someone come in later with broken thing i dunno, what's that onlyfans account you mentioned? I know people will interested on that word only haha @CyberMurning: tell me more about the cake To clarify, Australian Consumer Law isn’t “above” manufacturer warranties. It is unavoidable if you are an Australian “consumer” (there are criteria, but typically, anyone who is not a business) purchasing an item from anyone conducting business in Australia. This includes manufacturers and suppliers. Relevantly, there are a set of “consumer guarantees” (and warranties) which are usually more protective than most business’ typical warranties. Some businesses (example Apple) try to account for this in their standard warranty. Example, most places in the world, Apple products come with a one year warranty. In Australia, it is one extra year by standard (two years). Some other countries have better consumer protections laws and get an even better protection through their local laws. For example, if my 2.5 year old $3,000 MacBook Pro has a serious fault, like a series of dead pixels, or a seriously degraded battery (not normal wear and tear, but perhaps down to 50% max capacity), that would be considered a serious fault and a product that costs that much shouldn’t fail within 2.5 years. Big businesses like Apple (or a supplier like JB Hi-Fi) will typically honour this and replace the item no questions asked (although they could also opt to repair or reimburse). Other businesses have the same obligations but sometimes it is like drawing water from stone. The guarantee is proportionate to the price paid. Maybe can’t expect a $400 laptop to last 3.5 years. It’s all a grey area and difficult to enforce. Definitely worthwhile being across the consumer warranties and protections, remedies etc. try looking up a brochure or leaflet on ACL or ask ChatGPT some questions, or flick through the legislation. I know but they clearly state above "Hurry! This introductory price and extended warranty are limited to the first batch, and it's first-come, first-served!" but they don't mention how long they extended it. So i was just wanting clarification on that. Thank you for your reminder. We have corrected the original text. "Warranty year" refers to one year, and we apologize for the previous incorrect statement. So based on the calculation below (thanks, ChatGPT), can i assume this is safe to be brought along for overseas travel since it's below the 100Wh travel rule? The Xiaomi Power Bank 25000 P03MI has: • Capacity: 25,000mAh • Voltage: Typically 3.63V (common for lithium-ion cells) (25000 \times 3.63) \div 1000 = 90.8Wh Or you can just click the Xiaomi website link provided by op and it'll tell you: *Suitable for air travel: This product contains five 5,000mAh battery cells with a rated capacity of 14,000mAh (5V/6A) and a battery power of 90.8Wh. According to the International Aviation Standard, power banks with less than 100Wh power are permitted on airplanes. Yes, that's correct, 90.8Wh, and it has clear labeling to ensure you can pass through security when you board the plane Just bought the Zmi hmmm… should I have waited? The ZMI QB826G is a product validated by thousands of buyers in the market. The Xiaomi product has some functional updates and different dimensions compared to the QB826G, which is why we are offering a significant discount to promote it in the market.

Title: Israel Takes Steps Toward Resuming War and Left-Wing Bureaucrats Hijack Georgia's Multibillion-Dollar Medicaid Contract
URL: https://freebeacon.com/newsletters/israel-takes-steps-toward-resuming-war-and-left-wing-bureaucrats-hijack-georgias-multibillion-dollar-medicaid-contract/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T12:00:35Z

Last week, we reported that Israel planned to resume the war in Gaza with a wave of airstrikes and a reduction of humanitarian aid to the strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began putting those plans into motion on Sunday, announcing that he had halted the entry of any "goods and supplies into Gaza." Netanyahu, the Free Beacon's Andrew Tobin reports from Tel Aviv, "said the decision was a response to Hamas’s rejection of a proposal by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to extend the phase one hostage-ceasefire deal that expired a day earlier." Under the proposal, which Israel had agreed to, Israel and Hamas would take another 50 days to negotiate the ceasefire’s second phase. Hamas would release half of the remaining Israeli hostages on day one and the remainder on the final day. If Hamas continues to reject the proposal, Netanyahu said, "there will be additional consequences." "The blockade of Gaza is one of a series of escalatory steps that Israel, backed by President Donald Trump, is prepared to take in order to end Hamas's control of Gaza," writes Tobin. "Israel expects it will ultimately have to take full military control of Gaza and is developing plans to do so starting in several weeks." "Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Saturday that Southern Command is on high alert and preparing for a return to fighting on short notice. In recent days, Israeli troops have been training to retake the strategically important Netzarim Corridor and other areas of Gaza from which the military withdrew during the ceasefire and for the possible relocation of the civilian population from the north of the strip to humanitarian zones in the south, according to the report." READ MORE: Israel Cuts All Aid To Gaza in Step Toward Resumption of Full-Scale War When Georgia's community health department solicited bids for the state's blockbuster Medicaid contract in 2015, it asked insurers basic questions about dental care access and congestive heart failure. Things changed last year when the department's senior staffers hijacked the bidding process to insert questions related to transgender children. That's according to internal documents reviewed by our Andrew Kerr. They show that the bidding application for the multibillion-dollar contract initially asked insurers "about a hypothetical 14-year-old white female with anorexia and depression who shares a bedroom with her younger sister." But career staffers "swapped the biological female for a transgender person"—and subsequently dinged bidders who provided answers that strayed from liberal orthodoxy on the issue. The state scored applications out of 1,000 possible points, and the difference between winning and losing came down to less than 10 points. The transgender question was worth 10 points. The application also included a DEI question worth 15. "The staffers' decision to insert that question—and reward companies that regurgitated left-wing positions on transgender care—reflects a significant disconnect between Kemp's policy preferences and the career staffers tasked with carrying them out," writes Kerr. "Kemp signed a law banning gender surgeries and hormone therapies for children in 2023. One year earlier, he signed a law that allowed the Georgia High School Association to bar biological men from competing in women's sports." READ MORE: How Left-Wing Bureaucrats Hijacked the Bidding Process for Georgia's Multibillion-Dollar Medicaid Contract North of the Beltway, in Delaware, state Democrats passed a 2021 law forcing 40 percent of power production to come from green energy by 2035. As a result, the state's main utility company, Delmarva, must import large amounts of electricity produced by wind and solar, purchase renewable energy credits from other states, or face fines. So far, it's struggled to fill the first two buckets to the state's satisfaction—and paid $26 million in fines to stay in compliance. In the meantime, electric bills are skyrocketing, with some residents facing a 350 percent spike in recent months. Those increases, to be sure, come amid a period of extremely low temperatures. But the green energy side of the equation is raising questions: State senate minority leader Gerald Hocker said a "meeting with stakeholders in the energy sector" made it clear "that Delaware's green energy mandates … are a significant factor in driving up costs." Delaware's green push comes in spite of the state's unique reliance on fossil fuels. Green energy sources generate just 6 percent of Delaware's total electricity output, while natural gas generates 87 percent. Nationwide, those numbers are 21 percent and 43 percent, respectively. At the same time, most of Delaware's electricity comes from out of state, a dynamic "that has become more acute as it has moved to stop building gas power plants and shut down existing fossil fuel power generation," our Thomas Catenacci reports. "The situation—which has emerged as a key political issue, resulted in packed town halls where angry citizens have voiced concerns and has led to the creation of a petition against Delmarva and a local Facebook group named 'Delmarva Power Victims' with more than 14,400 members—may force lawmakers to reckon with the state's far-left energy policies."

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Dan Goldberg has charted an unlikely path to become top of his class in the student housing market. A neuroscience major at Brown University, Goldberg fell into a career on Wall Street by accident after teaching tennis to hedge fund legend Marc Lasry, who gave him an internship at Avenue Capital. From there, Goldberg spent 14 years in high finance, splitting his time between Goldman Sachs (GS) and Blackstone (BX), where he acquired $1 billion student housing portfolios and oversaw U.S. core-plus real estate investing. Now Goldberg serves as president of Chicago-based Core Spaces, a vertically integrated real estate investment firm and property manager that specializes in student housing and build-to-rent communities. Core Spaces has a portfolio of more than 45,000 student housing beds and 3,000 single-family, build-to-rent homes, with a business plan committed to innovation and outside-the-box thinking. Goldberg sat down with Commercial Observer to discuss his investment strategy. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: You’ve been involved in student housing for almost 20 years. How did you train yourself to understand this asset class especially at a time when it was not well-known? Dan Goldberg: Well, it’s actually quite intuitive in some ways. In college, I lived in a dilapidated row house with my best friends, and the idea that there could be an option that was turnkey, that was safe, that you didn’t have to go get your utilities lined up or go find furniture on Craigslist, and had a great location seemed to be an obvious thing. Even in those early days there was a lot of fragmentation in the student housing space, and even to someone who at the time was six years out of college, it was painfully evident that it was ripe for disruption if you could build something in a great location or was just purposely built, turnkey. I do think as a value investor that there’s opacity in the space. There’s a lot of local and specific knowledge. These are buildings designed for students that are institutionally run with operating partners that have developed, through their years, very specific knowledge about what makes a good location. If you just look at a map and say, “Oh, this is on campus,” you and I both kind of know that if it’s next to the football stadium at Brown University, that’s actually a mile and a half away from anything you want to be close to, as a student. And so I saw a real value-investing opportunity to work with operating partners that had legitimate informational advances through their experience on the sites. And so kind of collectively that was my pitch, and we went from there. How did you choose the territories or colleges that you felt were ripe for disruption? Walk me through that strategy. I’ve probably been to 65 different college campuses over the last decade, which is part of the job. What we focus on at Core is big flagship public universities, typically ones that are growing. When there’s new supply that’s added, it’s typically a small percentage of the overall enrollment growth, and enrollment is, obviously, demand, so you don’t just have to take people out of that shadowy, fragmented inventory. And, in my view, the value of public education continues to be a steal, especially versus smaller private colleges, which also informs our decision to invest in those schools. For example, the University of Maryland, if you’re [enrolled] in-state or even if you’re out-of-state, it has a great value proposition, you get an incredible education. I don’t think that’s going anywhere, and I think that’s gonna be a staple for years to come, whereas some of these schools that are, you know, maybe top 50 or 100 private schools that cost $70,000 a year, I think there’s more of a threat over time to the value of that education versus the public. And so we generally focus on those types of universities. What is Core Space’s prime investment strategy or ethos? When I was at Goldman, my thesis was those types of [big, public university] markets, but also the best locations. And there were a couple of groups that would build high-rise properties at what we call the bull’s eye — which is equidistant, or walking distance, from the main quad, the main retailer, and the frat houses or social life. If you can find the bull’s eye it’s usually right next to the school bookstore, it’s a great location. So that was the thesis that I had. Core was actually around for almost a decade before I got there, and I met the company founder Marc Lifshin at University of Wisconsin in Madison, which is where one of their first large flagship projects was, and I was immediately inspired. I walked into Core’s asset and there was a music room, there was a volleyball court that turned into an ice skating rink, there was a rooftop infinity pool, and they built these penthouse units that were just a different level of design. And I remember walking around with Marc and saying “This is the nicest asset in the country I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been looking at student housing for years,” And he said, “Well, why don’t you come in a week from now. We screwed up on so many different things, let me tell you about all the lessons we learned. We’re an open book about that.” And so, what brought me to Core, and is still in our DNA, is a culture of relentless innovation and self-criticism, where we wanna push the envelope on design, on the user experience, and we wanna be open and honest about how we can continue to get better. And the student housing demographic and the profile of the renter is constantly changing. So it’s a lot of fun if you’re up for that kind of challenge because you’re always chasing and losing your target as the tenant preferences change. Not every college student has parents that can afford rents for an asset with an ice skating rink. Are these amenities a trend or the future of student housing? We’ve developed a barbell strategy over time, where we have luxury penthouse units, but on the other side of the spectrum, 30 percent to 40 percent of our projects are what are called price sets. At large public universities, there are certain tenants that are pricing sensitive, and some want a penthouse suite. That’s a cool thing to sell, and you’re gonna have people that fill in at that end of the barbell. But some of our projects now are 2,000 beds. We’re obsessed with really well-designed, efficient units that have a price point that’s somewhat commensurate with living on campus, or living a couple of miles away with a little bit more space and less amenities. So how do you differ yourself from the competition? We’re probably more well known for pushing the envelope and innovating a bit more. Let me give you some examples. Our units are more efficient than something our competitors might design, they’re proprietary designs that really haven’t been seen before. You’ve got Murphy beds that come down from the walls, and we’ve taken some bets that other competitors haven’t. We lease those beds in two months. But conventional wisdom in student housing is that you need bed-bath parity, so every bedroom has to have a bathroom. And we like to challenge ourselves and say, “You know what? Some students, especially in the Florida projects, just want a price point.” And so we ask ourselves: How do we create a great living experience that doesn’t necessarily have all of the same things that our competitors feel like are necessary? We are also obsessed with the user experience and also marketing to our students. For example, when we at leased up Knoxville, we partnered with Barstool Sports and [Hall of Fame NFL quarterback] Peyton Manning. And so, we hosted an event bringing Peyton Manning, who’s an alumni of University of Tennessee, together with this really popular podcast on Barstool Sports, and we did kind of a roommate challenge that Peyton and the Barstool team mediated, and it was a huge success. And so other student housing companies aren’t doing that. We own a lot of beds at Clemson University, and in November, we hosted a concert with a top 10 country music singer named Lee Brice in our parking lot. I don’t think any student housing company hosted a full-blown concert before. And then there’s our social media handles. We have a big brand presence in Instagram and one of our videos just hit 12 million views — I don’t understand it at all, but that’s half of all college students in the country, and those type of things differentiate Core in the market. Where do you guys source your capital from, and what do your investment partnerships look like? Most real estate transactions in the operator and developer space are one-off deals, with 60 to 65 percent leverage, where the capital is 5 to 20 percent of the equity, and you find a one-off joint venture partner to be the rest of the equity in the capital stack. And that’s what we’ve done for a long time. We have 17 different institutional capital partners—limited partners right now— in our various joint ventures. But one thing that differentiates us is we started raising closed-end funds, so that’s discretionary development capital. They’re very large discretionary investment funds, and as a company, we’ve invested a lot in fundraising and distribution channels. We have institutional sales fundraisers that have come from Wall Street to help develop more relationships with traditional funds investors, as we see that pocket of capital being a real differentiator for us. You’re also involved in the build-to-rent space. What’s the investment strategy behind those assets? The build-to-rent space feels a lot like cottage-style student housing products, and it feels ripe for disruption right now, where what’s out there doesn’t really suit the needs of people who actually want to have a feeling of a true community. I think there’s 17 million renters of noninstitutional homes right now. Our approach is the anti-”Truman Show” approach, where it feels a little bit like a movie set when you walk around some of these communities of single-family homes. And we want to try to bring our culture of really creating something that’s bespoke and that speaks to the community, but is not just a one-size-fits-all model. We want to create vibrant communities that feel like a very differentiated type of community, and so that’s the approach that we’re taking to a space that we think is ripe for disruption. It costs more to do that. How do you guys justify being different and making the single-family or the build-to-rent home a little more unique? I think some people think that build-to-rent is just for people that have no other options. We call that a rent-by-necessity demographic. But we believe that it’s not just people that can’t afford a house. If you build the right products and the right community, some people want flexibility and convenience, too. And so we are making a bet that some of our demographics, where we’re anywhere from 150 to 400 homes in our communities, where you could have some people that could afford to live in a home, but want the flexibility of a house with zero maintenance hassles. And then there are other homes that are designed really efficiently that have a much lower price point, and everywhere in between. So that’s the way that we’re able to do it. It’s slightly larger projects, which bring down our cost basis, in a belief that some of those units with a barbell strategy are not just renters by need. Do you think most Americans want to be renters of homes rather than owners who can tap into the equity of the homeownership world? For some people, yes. And I think there’s been a traditional wisdom within America that your biggest investment is equity in your house. But it’s a big liquid investment, and there are some people, especially in this Uber generation, where there’s changing preferences, that may want to have the majority of their investments in more liquid assets, like the stock market, and have the ability to move instead of just staying in a job, in the same place, where they have to be in the same house and be stuck in their property, potentially in an economic downturn. Some want to have that flexibility. And I think we believe that it’s not everyone, these are not like absolutes, but there’s a proportion of people, probably a subset of people, that would trade out of the idea of locking in on an investment and having that flexibility. But it’s a big addressable market. And so to us, it’s about being obsessed with the way that we design our spaces. For example, a lot of our competitors, especially the homebuilders, have large dining rooms. We don’t think that a lot of our renting demographic, which is generally aging millennials, are going to want a big formal dining room anymore. And we’re happy to make that bet that we can keep a price point lower on a more efficient home that has an open kitchen floor. These are basic things that we do that are a little different than a lot of competitors. What’s the best investment advice you’ve received in your career in real estate? A partner of mine at Goldman Sachs gave me advice that who you’re investing with probably matters the most. Great management teams are worth their weight in gold. And now that I’m over on the operating side, I can see that the culture, the grit, the collaboration, and the integrity of the teams is what usually differentiates investment success from investment failure.

Title: Podcast: S4Capital’s Martin Sorrell on AI and the enterprise
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/podcast/Podcast-Sir-Martin-Sorrell-on-AI-and-the-enterprise
Time Published: 2025-03-03T10:36:00Z
Full Content:
Coloures-pic - Fotolia In this podcast, we look at artificial intelligence (AI), its benefits and what it can bring to the enterprise, with Martin Sorrell. Sir Martin – founder of what became the world’s largest advertising company, WPP – is now chairman of the board of S4Capital, which aims at digitally native delivery of services. He talks about the use cases in advertising and marketing, limited currently, but where activities like planning and buying media will likely become automated by AI and work algorithmically. Sir Martin also talks about how AI can bring a huge leap in productivity across all sectors and why enterprises need to take advantage of that by integrating the work of the chief information officer (CIO) and chief marketing officer (CMO) and bring data to the fore in their work. Well, significantly, I guess. I mean, there’s a caveat with that in that the actual use cases are few and far between. So, when you work with the leaders in the AI industry, like an Nvidia or whoever, they are very focused on what are the use cases. And when you look at use cases, I would say we've got a lot of tests going on, audits, workshops going on. But actually the number of clients who are willing, for whatever reason, to implement at scale are relatively limited. But, with that as a sort of health warning, if that’s the right way of putting it, basically we see five things happening in our industry. The first is around visualisation and copywriting. • Download this podcast • So, that’s producing ads. It takes less time. And that is a two-edged sword because our business, our industry, the industry is a trillion dollars. Clients spend about a trillion dollars on advertising, about $700bn in digital and about $300bn in traditional. Digital is growing, probably at around 10% or 15% a year, and growing its share. So, when we started S4 six years ago, digital was probably about 50% of the market – it’s now 70%. And traditional is declining – probably about 0% to 5% a year if you have live sport. And, if you don’t have live sport, you’re probably down 5%, 10% or 15%. And that continues to be the dynamic in the industry. So, really there are two industries. But with that as background, a lot of that revenue is generated by agencies, by time. And, if you’re compressing the amount of time for making ads, as you are with copywriting and visualisation, what took you weeks or days is now taking you hours or minutes. The amount of time is reduced, and procurement departments, the clients – quite rightly – say, it takes you less time, it should cost you less. So I would say there’s compression. There will be fewer copywriters and fewer art directors as a result. So, that’s one area. The second area, which I think is really interesting from a growth point of view, is personalisation at scale. So, we work for a Netflix, or an Amazon Prime, or Disney Plus or Univision, and we can produce, if we’re launching Squid Game or Narcos for Netflix, historically we might produce about a million and a half assets, at least in theory. We’re now producing multiples of that using AI and personalisation at scale and using first-party data and signals from the platforms. So, that’s a huge area of opportunity. The price per asset is falling, but the number of assets used is rising at such a rate that there will be more employment for people in that area. So, that’s the second area. The third area is media planning and buying. Unfortunately, for the holding companies that dominate the media planning and buying space – probably there are six of them of scale, which probably have about 60% between them of the market in terms of planning and buying – they employ about 200,000 people [but] there won’t be 200,000 people in two or three years’ time. Unfortunately, also, the processes are very manual. If you compare it to the investment industry, to a BlackRock or a Blackstone, which manage more than one trillion each in terms of funds under management, they don’t manage those investments and the distribution between property or equities, or private equity, or gold, or bitcoin, real estate, or whatever it is, they don’t manage it manually or semi-manually, they manage it algorithmically. And the same thing is going to happen with media planning and buying. And, you see that already with the platforms like Google and Meta – Google had with Pmax, Performance Max, and Meta with Advantage Plus. Actually, it was really interesting. The CFO [chief financial officer] of Meta said in the fourth quarter earnings for last year, or this year, but commenting on last year, Meta’s total ad revenues are about 160 billion versus Google’s 260 billion and Amazon’s 61/60 billion and TikTok’s 40 billion outside mainland China. So, those four platforms are half of total ad spending – 500 billion between them – and about 70% of digital. But the CFO of Meta said Advantage Plus accounted for about 17 or 18 billion of the 160 billion. So really 10% of Meta’s media planning and buying is being done on a program which basically delivers algorithmic answers to small and medium-sized businesses, just like Performance Max does at Google, although we don’t have the data. So, really interesting what’s happening on media planning and buying. So, you won’t depend on a 25-year-old media planner and buyer in the future for input and output. That buyer will have a much more sophisticated output coming from algorithmically analysed planning and buying decisions. So, that’s the third area. The fourth area is general efficiency. I’ll give you an example of that. We have a joint venture with Nvidia and AWS [Amazon Web Services] and Adobe around outside broadcasting. If you’re doing an outside broadcast, you need a truck for that in conventional ways. And that truck will cost you 10 million [dollars], you’d amortise it over five years at two million [dollars] a year. We can provide a cloud-based solution with Nvidia, AWS and Adobe for $100,000 or $200,000. I referred before to the traditional media companies being under heavy pressure, so you can see that they would leap at the opportunity of reducing their costs and becoming more efficient. It’s a good example of agency and client efficiency. And the fifth area, the last one, is democratisation of knowledge. I don’t think there’s any accident that [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang has 51 direct reports. If Computer Weekly went to McKinsey and said, ‘What’s the ideal organisational span or spread for a CEO?’, you would say 12 or 13. Jensen manages it apparently with 51 direct reports or thereabouts. He also doesn’t have as many one-to-one meetings. What he tends to have is ... KPIs [key performance indicators] for his direct reports and then monitors their progress. So, what you’re getting is the flattening of organisations and AI reducing the silos and the politics that go on inside big companies, and making them much more efficient and effective, and simplifying processes and bringing people together in much more effective ways. So, those are the five areas – just to sum up: visualisation and copywriting, personalisation at scale, media planning and buying, general efficiency and democratisation of knowledge. The answer is it will affect ... sorry, not ‘will affect’; it is affecting everything. Probably, to be fair, affecting things like manufacturing more so than mine because, with the exception probably of General Motors – that’s the biggest example that we’ve come across. I mean, we have Google Hatch, we have Forever 21 with Meta, we have some work with SC Johnson and others. But with those exceptions, I think the one case study in our industry where a company has literally turned itself, its marketing model on its head and it’s doing that for competitive reasons. We’re seeing in the auto industry and the financial services industry the rise of lower-cost, lower-price competitors. So, in the case of the auto industry, Chinese EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous vehicles; in the case of financial services, fintech companies. Now, these new competitors can produce products or services at lower costs and therefore the traditional manufacturers or the traditional financial services companies have to make their model much more efficient. So, the answer is it affects other verticals deeply, and probably more fundamentally so far. I think it will fundamentally affect advertising and marketing in the future, but I think it’s affecting things like manufacturing and distribution far more quickly. There are three pieces of advice we – CMOs or CIOs – would focus on, because when you talk about AI, it’s really uniting several functions. It’s uniting marketing, it’s uniting technology and IT. I often think there should be conferences with CMOs and CIOs – those are the two. I remember John Chambers used to run at Cisco every two years a conference for CEOs and CIOs, and I think that from an AI point of view, it’s really important to get the CMO and the CIO together because their worlds are colliding, for want of a better word, but I think there are three areas. Agility is key. Everybody talks about agility, but delivering it is much more difficult, so that’s one thing. I would say taking back control after the great financial crisis in 2008, people tend to outsource. You know, finance and procurement said outsource, get the headcount out of the company. So a lot of functions were delegated outside, and that may sound strange coming from somebody in the agency business, but that may be misdirection and what you have to do is to exercise more control. And the third and final point is the importance of first-party data, which is very much more focused. So, with deprecation of third-party cookies by Google – not totally, but directionally. [And] with the change in the IDFA rules with Apple moving from individual IP addresses to cohorts, to groups. The use of first-party data – that is, consumer consented data which can be used freely, or as freely as possible – combined with the signals from the platforms, from the three western ones I mentioned before, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and then in the east, Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance (or TikTok); those are the three, the six games in town really in terms of scale, using the signals from those platforms, plus the first-party data critical. I would say those are the skills, organisational skills – agility, as I say, everybody talks about it, but it’s very difficult to deliver it, particularly in a volatile, you know, in a Trump 2.0 world, you have to be very adaptable and very agile. So, that’s one area, take back control. You’re going to have to control the data, integrate the data. Very few clients have first-party data at scale in a fully integrated way. And then finally, first-party data.

Title: How hedge funds became an industry of haves and have-nots — and what it means for the $4.5 trillion sector

The four biggest multistrategy firms' dominance in the industry has made it harder for under-the-radar names to compete. For years, it was common knowledge that smaller hedge funds outperformed larger peers. Investors focused on finding up-and-coming managers before they made it big and raised billions. Big-name institutions like Blackstone and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas seeded new funds and sought out emerging managers. While there was safety and, typically, capacity in the biggest funds, there was alpha in unknown names. This has all changed with the yearslong industry takeover by the biggest multistrategy firms. The big four — Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny — have in recent years outperformed peers despite their ballooning sizes, dominated the fundraising environment even though they're mostly closed to new money, and turned the talent market on its head with eye-popping offers for investors. For the first time, scale benefits both the manager and the LP, and the result is four managers with overwhelming clout. Business Insider talked to more than a dozen fund founders, allocators, and industry experts, such as top prime brokers and recruiters, to understand how smaller platforms plan to survive the unprecedented concentration of capital and talent and where allocators are turning in this new reality. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage desk, using regulatory filings, estimated in July that 53 multistrategy firms employed a total of 18,600 people. More than 71% of them worked for one of the big four, leaving the 49 other funds with a combined head count smaller than Millennium's. Fundraising — which came easy for big and small platforms alike when interest rates were lower three years ago — is now a slog for many smaller multistrategy funds, several executives told Business Insider. The shift has cramped some firms' expansion plans that commenced during the boom times following the pandemic and put pressure on a business model that thrives with scale. Meanwhile, Point72 and Citadel have returned capital to investors, and Millennium can command a five-year lockup period for new money, a term length previously unheard of in the hedge fund world. One allocator told BI that Point72, the $39 billion firm run by the billionaire New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, had a $9 billion waitlist — which is more capital than firms like Eisler and Walleye manage. A different allocator compared the concentration of capital in the four largest firms to passive investing, in which all the assets flow to Vanguard, BlackRock, or State Street. "For people who can't get into the top guys, they're saying they'll just invest in some other structure or asset class instead," this person said, pointing to private credit as a landing spot for some of this capital. The big four platforms have grown to a point where smaller rivals aren't battling another hedge fund — they're fighting with institutions. "They're becoming more and more like investment banks to an extent," said one platform founder with less than $10 billion in total assets. Others in the industry likened Citadel in particular to pre-IPO Goldman Sachs — a comparison Ken Griffin would most likely welcome, given his laudatory comments about the firm. A hypothetical $5 billion multistrategy manager has a much different existence than even the $21 billion firm Balyasny. One smaller platform executive hoping to grow said that, even as Citadel and Point72 returned capital to LPs, "it was a bitch last year raising money." A February report from JPMorgan's capital advisory team said hedge funds with assets between $500 million and $5 billion had net outflows of $21.5 billion in the past two years, while firms with assets greater than $5 billion hauled in $12.2 billion in net new money. Goldman Sachs' July report noted that allocators were starting to balk at the high costs required to run multistrategy firms. The trickle-down effect is that firms such as ExodusPoint have accepted a cash hurdle — where performance fees accrue only when returns surpass that of a Treasury bond — to appease antsy LPs. Despite the buzz around the launch of Jain Global, the firm raised billions less than it was expected to pull in. Several smaller-platform executives said LPs were also worried about a platform unwind and what a significant market event could do to these firms, given that they operate with so much leverage. With more capital in multistrategy funds than ever before, some market watchers have been sounding the alarm about the knock-on effects of this investing style. These funds use borrowed money to juice their bets, meaning any significant movement against their position can cause losses to accumulate quickly. The risk-management systems of these platforms will often force their investors to shed positions quickly in the face of mounting losses, which can exacerbate a stock's decline. It's a market risk that Viking Global's chief investment officer, Justin Walsh, said he monitors closely and that the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, raised concerns about last month. But now that scale has become necessary for those competing directly with the four biggest firms, any slowdown in growth can be fatal, and suddenly tepid allocators could cause a domino effect, a former hedge fund allocator said. "Without capital, you can't get a diversity of return streams," they said. "Without a diversity of return streams, the model doesn't really make sense." Those that can't beat the biggest players at their own game need to offer something different. "If you're going to compete with Citadel and Millennium in their own backyard, you're already dead," one person who's building out their multistrategy offering told BI. They added, "Do you have a right to exist — or are you on borrowed time because you raised money when all multistrats could raise money?" Matthew Barrett, the head of manager research at Kepler Partners, who works with allocators searching for funds, said smaller platforms must offer a "derivative" of the main models the big four have perfected. For Dymon Asia, a $3 billion multistrategy fund with offices in Asia and the Middle East, the differentiator is geography. At SummitTX, Crestline Investors' recently rebranded multistrategy fund, "what resonates is the alignment of the whole package," the firm's chief investment officer, Caroline Cooley, said. This includes fees, liquidity, transparency of positioning, and risk so that institutional investors have a more personalized setup. Other midsize shops focus on investment opportunities that are more niche and wouldn't move the needle at the biggest platforms. "They need PMs to run $2 billion to $4 billion and manage seven to nine people," said Rich Schimel, who cofounded the $3 billion firm Cinctive Capital and once ran a stock-picking unit at Citadel. "There are not a lot of people out there who can do that. Not efficiently, at least." "It's a whole different model than ours," he said. At his firm, he said, the focus is partially on "low-hanging fruit" in mid-cap stocks that are too small for the biggest funds, for example. The Holy Grail, though, might be finding a way to offer multistrategy returns at a fraction of the price. The pass-through fee structures nearly everyone has adopted to keep up in the war for talent have LPs on the hook for billions in employee compensation. Several allocators said a firm able to recreate multistrategy returns without relying on dozens of human portfolio managers would have plenty of backers. While Doug Haynes' Norias Research never ended up launching, reportedly because of an inability to raise sufficient capital, hedge fund LPs said his proposed firm's algorithm-driven and less-people-intensive structure made sense. And gross returns from a manager like this could be muted compared with high-head-count peers and still come out on top. "If a full pass-through fee is 10%," Barrett said, "you're already running at a significant head start." Consolidation in top-heavy industries snowballs, and the multistrategy space is not immune. While the Millennium-Schonfeld tie-up was called off in 2023, the big four platforms have warped the industry by bringing independent external funds in-house and spinning off new firms backed by the mother ship. While there's optimism around hedge funds generally, a different Goldman report from last summer said that assets in the multistrategy industry had tapered off and that outflows outpaced performance gains through the first half of 2024. The talent pool can barely handle the big four, much less additional platforms hoping to replicate their models. "There is definitely a difference between A talent and B talent, and you see it across different platforms," said Justin Young, the director of investments at Multilateral Endowment Management Company, an allocator that manages assets for Oklahoma State University's endowment and other institutions. Even those on the smaller end of the spectrum acknowledge there will probably be fewer platforms going forward. "Are there too many? There could be," one founder with under $10 billion in assets said. "There could be some consolidation." Jump to

Consider the following two stories involving legal disputes between American companies and foreign governments. In 1919, the ocean steamer The Pesaro sailed from Genoa, Italy, for New York City. Built in Germany for a German shipper and formerly named the SS Moltke, the steamer had been seized by the Italian government in 1915 after Italy entered World War I. On board for its departure to America four years later were 75 cases of artificial silk owned by a company incorporated and based in the United States called the Berizzi Brothers. When The Pesaro arrived in New York after two weeks at sea, however, the Berizzi Brothers cried foul: Only 74 cases of silk were delivered. One had been lost or damaged in transit. Eighty-two years later, a dispute on an altogether larger scale began. In 2001, with Argentina’s economy mired in recession, the country defaulted on around $93 billion of government debt, in what was then the largest sovereign debt default in history. Though a portion of that debt was owed to foreign governments, the default primarily involved private bondholders such as institutional investors. Most of these creditors would eventually agree to restructure the debt for cents on the dollar (thus booking losses), but a minority of the debt holders refused to accept this “haircut.” Like the Berizzi Brothers eight decades earlier, these holdouts, too, were based in the United States, namely a group of Wall Street “vulture funds” that had invested in the debt at distressed prices. Beyond the fact that both cases pitted American firms against foreign governments, what links these stories is that the firms in question sought legal redress for their grievances. Not only that, but they sought this redress specifically in American courts, and thus by appeal to US law. The Berizzi Brothers sued for $250 in damages; the vulture-fund owners of the Argentinian debt sued for full face value plus interest. The Berizzi Brothers’ case ended up in the US Supreme Court, and in 1926 the company lost, which is to say that the Italian government won. The Pesaro was owned and operated by Italy, and it was well established under US law that foreign governments (and their oceangoing vessels) were immune from suit in domestic courts. Yes, the Italian government was engaged in this case in a commercial activity, but it was so engaged, the court ruled, in a public rather than private capacity and with a public purpose. But the Argentine government would not prove so fortunate, twice finding itself on the receiving end of negative legal judgments in its battle with the vulture funds. The first was when the US courts decided in 2012 in favor of the creditor holdouts, ruling that the full bond value was indeed due. The second followed Argentina’s subsequent decision—highly unusual among sovereign debtors in recent decades—to stand firm and continue to not pay up. While the US courts could not directly make Argentina pay, they could and did make life extremely uncomfortable, issuing rulings from 2012 to 2014 that indirectly forced the Argentine government’s hand by prohibiting it from making payments to other creditors unless it paid the holdouts first, and by prohibiting anyone anywhere in the world except Argentina from helping the country make such payments. This pair of legal battles prompts a number of questions: What role does the law play in the arbitration of economic disputes? How does the direct involvement of sovereign states in such disputes affect that legal function? And what difference does it make when legal and economic disputes involving governments spill across national borders? These concerns have once again moved to the fore, with an explicitly protectionist and imperially minded president having taken the reins of power in America. The transition from The Pesaro and silk to Argentinian bonds and American vulture funds is an essential backdrop against which to answer these questions. In the course of eight decades, US courts seemingly made a decisive turn against foreign governments, stacking the deck in favor of American companies and becoming, in the process, a handmaiden to American empire. The two stories with which we began effectively bookend the account of transnational commercial law that Shaina Potts, a geography professor at UCLA, provides in her new book, Judicial Territory. Potts’s study is capacious, offering insights on everything from financialization and hegemony to international trade and globalization. But at the core of the book is the history of how we got from US courts being willing to rule in favor of foreign governments and against American firms in the 1920s to the opposite outcome in the 21st century. In a nutshell, that history is a chronicle of expanding US judicial authority over the economic decisions and activities of foreign governments, and in particular their relationships with private—usually American—companies. Governments that had previously been treated as sovereign and immune, such as the Italian government in its ownership and operation of The Pesaro, are no longer accorded such deference by US courts. Foreign states and their commercial dealings had not formerly been beyond the reach of US power altogether: The United States’ executive branch had rarely granted them immunity, especially when American interests were involved. What changed was that the US judiciary started to treat foreign governments exactly like private corporations, robbing them of any special legal status. This, as Potts describes it, was an epochal shift. The change began in earnest in the 1950s and ’60s, and it was initially centered on what came to be termed “the Third World” and on developments in various postcolonial countries. Independence for such countries was frequently followed—albeit sometimes not until decades later—by the nationalization of foreign-owned assets and by the establishment in their stead of state-owned enterprises. Bolivia, for instance, nationalized its tin mines; Turkey nationalized its railways, ports, and utilities; Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal; and countries ranging from Iran to Mexico nationalized their oil industries. Such nationalizations, which were integral to the plans of developing countries for a New International Economic Order, had long been regarded as beyond the purview of US law. But after World War II, a shift gradually occurred, and American courts increasingly came to treat the nationalization of US assets as unlawful expropriation. The nationalizations in Cuba on the heels of its revolution—Castro famously nationalized all American-owned sugar companies in 1960—were a particular flash point and are given special attention by Potts. The path from The Pesaro to Wall Street vulture funds, and the markedly different legal treatment accorded to the latter, were enabled by transformations—halting, uneven, and in certain respects still ongoing—in two main legal doctrines that had historically insulated foreign governments from US courts. The first concerned foreign sovereign immunity rules: Who and what were immune from lawsuits? In the 1950s, both the who and the what began to be understood by US jurists in more restrictive ways, with the result that the commercial acts of foreign states—such as Italy’s conveyance of silks to America—lost their former immunity (through the so-called “commercial exception”). The second key doctrine was “act of state.” This international legal principle asserts that acts carried out by sovereign states in their own territories—such as nationalizations—cannot be challenged by other countries’ courts. Historically, US courts fully respected this doctrine, but by the 1960s they’d started to chip away at it. In particular, commercial acts came to be excluded, just as they were from foreign sovereign immunity rules. Increasingly, it didn’t matter to US courts who a business operator or asset owner was: The activities and possessions of all economic actors (be they public or private) were no longer protected by the rules of sovereign immunity and acts of state. The expansion of US judicial authority that resulted from the parallel transformations of these two doctrines has been as audacious as it has been largely unnoticed outside of narrow legal circles. It has also been multidimensional: While the juridical encroachment on foreign sovereignty has perhaps been most notable in cases of financial contracts (with creditor rights typically being privileged, as with Argentina’s debt), the phenomena newly falling within the ambit of US law are far more extensive. Anything that conceivably could be subjected to the transnational application of US domestic commercial laws has been. This includes, for example, cigars: A landmark case was Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba (1976), in which the US Supreme Court ruled against the Cuban government, which had nationalized the cigar industry and subsequently refused to return the money mistakenly paid to it for pre-nationalization cigar shipments by importers in the United States. All that has been required to bring foreign governments to heel, Potts shows, is to successfully argue that the relationships or activities in dispute are “merely economic” (that is, private and commercial) rather than public and political, which is an argument that US courts have been increasingly happy to accept. Meanwhile, alongside this expansion of what is litigable in the United States, more striking still has been the expansion of who can be sued and where the relevant activities or assets are located. Today, no sovereign government can operate without the risk of falling afoul of US laws and being held so accountable, and this is true wherever in the world they happen to be operating. Indeed, while making foreign governments subject to US laws for what they do in America is one thing, making them subject to these laws for what they do elsewhere, including in their own countries, is something else entirely. Yet that is precisely what has come to pass. In 1990, the Nigerian government found itself embroiled in a US court case involving a contract it had awarded for the construction of a military hospital in Nigeria. Why? One American firm had accused another of having secured the contract through the bribery of Nigerian officials. The US Supreme Court decided that it did have the power to adjudicate the bribery accusation, thus reminding foreign governments the world over that they cannot deal with American firms, even at home, without considering how US courts will judge those dealings. (President Trump has recently weighed in on the appropriate course of judgment, telling US jurists to stop ruling against such bribery: “It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” he said.) As Potts insists, it is surely a sea change of profound political significance that, over the course of several decades in the post–World War II era, the US legal system has “helped make the whole world part of US economic space.” The transformations discussed in Judicial Territory are, as Potts admits, familiar ones to certain legal experts and well documented by legal historians. The particular importance and value of her new account lies in refusing the idea—implicit if not always explicit in the bulk of the existing literature—that this is merely a technocratic history, consisting merely of technical juridical tweaks. This process was not technocratic whatsoever, but partisan and nationalistic—thoroughly political from start to finish. To begin with, the timing of the commencement of this shift in legal treatment—in the 1950s—was anything but happenstance. It coincided both with an upsurge in the socialist and postcolonial nations pursuing economic development models that prioritized domestic populations and industries rather than multinational (increasingly, US) capital, and with the diminishing potential for powerful Western countries to strangle those upstart development models in ways they had in the past. The American courts’ growing subordination of the international arena into merely another jurisdiction of US domestic law is part and parcel, then, of a longer and larger historical policy of containment. Hence, the history that Potts narrates refuses technicist readings every step of the way. Behind the expansion of US judicial reach in the second half of the 20th century was the desire and determination of US government and corporate actors to tame statist national economic models overseas and to nip in the bud any developments remotely inimical to the interests of US capital. Much of the richness of Potts’s account is found in its careful identification of the primary nonjudicial actors (the private companies, investors, and policymakers with intimate connections to both constituencies) that animated and motivated these historical juridical transformations. The value and importance of Judicial Territory also lies in Potts’s assessment of the consequences and indeed intrinsic nature of the massive expansion of US judicial authority. One of the most enduring puzzles of the postcolonial age has been the question of why previously colonized countries so frequently failed to flourish once the colonizers were sent packing and formal sovereign status had been achieved. Potts does not exactly situate her study as an answer to that question, but an answer—one adding to and complementing a range of existing answers—is nonetheless what she indubitably provides. Postcolonial nations have widely failed to thrive, Potts effectively argues, because in reality they remained part of a de facto empire, although in this case an American as opposed to a British, German, or Spanish one; and this has served to undermine their nominal sovereignty. In fact, the refreshing thing about Potts’s book is that she makes no bones about it: Imperialism is clearly what we are dealing with here. But it is a different type of imperialism, one where exogenous judicial authority increasingly stands in for military or executive authority. Her book is a call to treat the United States as an imperial power precisely (although not exclusively) because of this extension across international space of US legal authority and, correspondingly, of the interests of US capital. Potts writes of the latter-day American empire evincing a “judicial modality”—of foreign sovereign nations and their peoples being subordinated to America by law rather than by colonial occupation or military force. What is perhaps most insidious about the “imperial modality”—another striking Potts framing—of US judicial power is the extent to which it was designed to quietly snuff out “postcolonialism.” The expansion of US judicial territory after World War II, Potts writes, “enabled the United States to continue exercising substantial authority over the decisions of foreign governments in an age of avowed anti-imperialism and formal sovereign equality.” More than that, the turn to law was a mechanism of the active disavowal of empire. “The recoding of many foreign policy issues as merely legal,” Potts notes at one point, “has been an especially potent way for the United States to obscure its own imperial operations.” Or, as she puts it elsewhere, the trick has been “to cloak the pursuit of US geopolitical and geoeconomic goals (always entangled to a large degree with private corporate interests) in the guise of the ‘rule of law.’” For that, of course, is the thing about law: its self-professed impartiality and, well, judiciousness. A modern-day empire rooted in law, of all things? The very idea seems counterintuitive, absurd even. Yet that is what Judicial Territory presents us with: empire camouflaged by the veneer of fairness that the law furnishes. If, as Carl von Clausewitz famously argued, war is merely the continuation of politics by other means, then, for Potts, law—at least the transnational application of domestic American commercial law—represents the continuation of empire by other means. Just as Indigenous populations worldwide resisted the imposition of foreign occupation and rule that was European colonialism, so too have national governments worldwide—to varying extents and with varying degrees of determination—resisted and challenged the postwar expansion of US judicial authority. Potts recounts many such examples of confrontation. The Cuban government has long been a particular irritant for the United States in this respect, repeatedly and robustly arguing against the overreach of American judicial authority. But Potts is also clear-eyed about the fact that, for the most part, these challenges have ultimately been in vain: “Once judicial decisions are made,” she observes, “most foreign governments do obey them most of the time.” But why? After all, as Potts notes, “transnational law is not backed directly by the enforcement power of the police the way domestic law is.” Her answer emphasizes the chilling impact of the economic blackballing that routinely comes with not conforming: “Foreign governments simply cannot afford to be locked out of US markets or legal services.” John Nichols Elie Mystal John Nichols Jeet Heer The case of Argentina’s defaulted debt and the vulture-fund holdouts appeared, at least, to represent something of a counterpoint to this tendency. When the US courts initially ruled in 2012 that the country did have to pay the vulture funds in full, Argentina continued to refuse to do so. It held firm. But that was not the end of the matter. As mentioned, the courts proceeded over the next two years to ratchet up the pressure further—effectively blocking Argentina from paying its other bondholders unless it first paid the holdouts in full—and in the end, the government buckled: In 2016, it settled with the vulture funds to the tune of more than $10 billion. Why? Argentina had essentially been excluded from the international capital markets while making its stand, compounding its domestic economic strife. Settling with the holdouts enabled Argentina to restore its credibility in the markets, issue new debt, and take measures to stabilize its economy. In the end, Argentina had no real choice, besides isolationism, other than to settle. Settling was structurally required of it, given the country’s dependent positioning in the circuits of international finance. Economists call this structural bind “international financial subordination,” by which they mean that fundamental inequality in the global financial system structurally subordinates less powerful states and constrains their financial autonomy. What Potts has brought to light with Judicial Territory is the crucial role of the law in fashioning and enforcing such subordination—that is, in demanding and securing the obedience of sovereign states. And the vulture funds? They made out like the bandits. According to data published by the courts in conjunction with the 2016 settlement, the funds each earned returns on investment of between 300 and 1,000 percent. But in its own analysis of the numbers, The Wall Street Journal found that one fund, Florida’s Elliott Investment Management, had actually achieved a return of up to 1,400 percent. Elliott was very much the public face of the vulture funds in the lengthy battle with Argentina, receiving endless brickbats for its leading role in facing down the Latin American sovereign. Indeed, the normalization of the term “vulture” to refer to Elliott and the other investment funds involved in the litigation plainly indexed the way they were widely viewed: as operating somehow beyond the acceptable pale. “Elliott is the ugly face of America,” one critic, capturing the mood, exclaimed in 2018. But to suggest that an investment fund such as Elliott is an aberration from contemporary American capitalism is to miss the point entirely. Insofar as it trades on the rule of law that the United States propagates and exercises globally, Elliott is American capitalism’s globalizing arm, its vanguard rather than black sheep. Argentina’s government was demonstrating an “inexhaustible disregard for the rule of law,” Paul Singer, Elliott’s founder and president, opined in a letter to his clients at the height of the dispute. In 2014, a banker who’d done business with the firm was asked by a journalist what made Elliott so successful. “They have deep respect for the rule of law and they expect others to share it,” the banker said. But what would happen if Singer and his colleagues ever sensed that others did not share this “respect”? “I think you know the answer,” the banker replied. Donald Trump’s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started. In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches.

Title: AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks. Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas. Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement. On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution. One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic. “You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.” Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality. The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation. Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise. “The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.” Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale. “It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said. On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.” DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels. Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns. So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube. One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers. “I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.” DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate. Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.” “It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.” Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out. Contextual adtech firms are focusing on signal loss fears, AI and brand safety to snare more clients. Across the board, there have been precipitous ad tech stock price declines, even if earnings are on the rise. WPP and Stagwell painted considerably different portraits of the future in the guidance they offered for the rest of 2025.

Title: Tech Insider: A cheap home EV charger that’s made in NZ, AWS’s local financials revealed

Time Published: 2025-03-02T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Evnex founder and CEO Ed Harvey outside his firm's Christchurch headquarters and manufacturing plant. Photo / Chris Keall Christchurch’s Evnex releases a home EV charger for the cost-of-living-crisis era. Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, reveals its latest NZ financials. Alexa gets AI smarts. DOGE “cuts” hit Wellington man Peter Griffin. Evnex’s brag line has always been that it’s the maker of the world’s slimmest home EV chargers. Now it’s also a contender for those feeling the cost-of-living pinch, its founder Ed Harvey says. The Christchurch firm’s new E2 Core smart charger is on a $999 launch special, putting it in play in the crowded sub-$1000 bracket. (Installation can double the price, depending on where your switchboard is located and other factors. The same games for all brands, so remember to factor this if you’re shopping around for a home charger.) The E2 Core is a 7-watt model, meaning you can add around 50km of range for every hour your EV (electric vehicle) is plugged in (the exact amount will vary by make and model; most EVs are supported). There’s an app and Wi-Fi support, and the ability to automatically delay charging until off-peak rates kick in. Harvey says the emphasis is on building a system that will appeal to the second wave of EV buyers, who’re often less technical than the early adopters. An E2 Plus model ($1299) adds frills, including support for Tesla features. Higher up the Evnex food chain, the E7 ($2065) offers 11W charging for around 75km of range per hour or 22W for about 120km of range for every hour your EV is plugged in. Harvey founded Evnex in Christchurch in 2014, after he converted his 1997 Honda Accord to electric power as a university project. The company is now New Zealand’s biggest manufacturer of EV chargers and software, and has recently expanded into Australia in 2023. He says Evnex has sold 8000 chargers over its lifetime and is set to double that amount over the next 18 months. Manufacturing will stay in Christchurch, and Evnex will stick to incorporating recycled materials and using printed circuit boards made by another Christchurch company, GPC Electronics. Harvey is loyal to the city. And he adds, candidly, that his firm just doesn’t have the scale to make it worth retooling for a Chinese plant. Regardless, “It only takes 20 minutes to assemble one of our chargers,” he says. “That’s pretty efficient.” Beyond Made in NZ and environmental appeal, Evnex is a charging partner for several new-vehicle brands including Polstar, Volkswagen, Volvo, Skoda, Cupra, Subaru and LDV in New Zealand. So for example Polestar (sold by Giltrap Group) pushes the Evnex chargers on its website and offers its buyers special pricing. Harvey spoke to the Herald from Sydney, where he’s now spending a lot of his time. There are five reasons. Despite some trimming, Australia still offers incentives for buying an EV (which vary by state). And there are no road user charges for EV owners (Victoria tried, but had its effort struck down by the state’s High Court, which ruled it unconstitutional). Australian private equity firm Adamantem took a 33% stake in Evnex (and half its board seats) through its $350m Environmental Opportunities Fund (the price was undisclosed; earlier Harvey told the Herald he was looking for around $10m). That made it the largest single shareholder in Evnex ahead of Harvey, and earlier backers Movac and Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1 – who supported a $3m seed round in 2021 – which both hold small stakes. If Adamantem’s name sounds familiar, it’s the firm that last year had a tilt at The Warehouse Group. It has investments in a range of businesses in New Zealand and Australia, including the sausage and bacon business Hellers, where it took control for $213m in 2018. It also owns EdgeZero (low-voltage grid monitoring) and electrical products maker Legend Corp. Harvey says that in Australia, this is even more so the case, with drivers now getting paid to charge in the middle of the day due to too much solar energy being generated. Australia has much higher home solar uptake, making it more fertile ground for Evnex’s more expensive solar-supporting X series. The Lucky Country is being bombed with new Chinese brands as Biden-era US tariffs – now being expanded by Trump II – push stock Dowunder (a phenomenon we’re also seeing, to a slightly lesser degree, on this side of the ditch). And lastly and definitely not leastly: “Cost of living is still an issue in Australia, but the economy is doing comparatively better than New Zealand. People probably aren’t tightening their belts quite as much,” Harvey says. The National-led Government has pledged to expand the current public charger network to 10,000 points by 2030, although details are still fuzzy. Would Harvey like to see some of that funding go to smart home chargers? He keeps his answer broad strokes. “We’d like to see some more incentives for EVs in New Zealand. We think the current Government is under-doing it a bit,” Harvey says. He would also like to see regulatory changes for the likes of pre-wiring for chargers in new apartment blocks (retrofits can be very expensive) and to make it easier – or simply possible – for kerbside solutions for townhouse dwellers and others without garages. “The less oil we require, the more we end up supporting our own state-owned electricity generators,” Harvey adds. “So I think it will be really great to see the National Party consider a little bit more about their policy because we import roughly $3 billion worth of fuel a year. And the more electric vehicles we have, the less reliant we are on that.” Amazon Web Services New Zealand made a net profit of $23.3m on net sales that rose 11% to $425.7m for the 12 months to December 31, 2024, according to accounts filed with the Companies Office on Friday. In 2023, AWS NZ made a net loss of $2.8m on net sales of $384.6m. The firm – 100% owned by its US parent Amazon.com Inc – made a $4.9m provision for income tax for 2024 vs $1.8m in 2023. Cash and equivalents increased to $105.7m from $57.0m. Payroll costs fell to $7.1m from $7.4m in 2023. Amazon bought land for its supermassive new Auckland data centre – construction has just kicked off at Westgate – via a separate vehicle created for the project, AWS Data Services, which has yet to file public accounts. In revenue terms, AWS is easily the global market leader in cloud services. Earlier this month, Amazon said AWS’ global revenue increased 19% to $28.79 billion in the fourth quarter as it continued to ride the AI boom. “Virtually every application that we know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it,” Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said. The local operation’s results were also informed by changes in inhouse expenses, with costs incurred from related party transactions swinging in AWS NZ’s favour. AWS declined an interview over its financials, in keeping with the usual approach from its Big Tech peers. Notes with AWS’s accounts note that New Zealand passed legislation last year to support the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Specificiallly, BEPS’ “Pillar Two” - that is, a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. The legislation came into effect on January 1. The returning President Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle Pillar Two - and even signed an executive order asking Federal agencies to “explore” retaliatory measures. Regardless, tax experts told the Herald that New Zealand would get little-to-no extra revenue from Pillar Two, given any top-up tax paid to reach the 15% minimum will be paid in a Big Tech firm’s home country. Amazon has previewed a conversational AI, dubbed Alexa+, for its Echo line of smart displays and screens and Fire TV - which spans from Amazon’s own gadgets to a new alliance with Panasonic to power its latest smart TVs. Head of devices Panos Panay fired off commands with natural phrasing: “Alexa, what’s that song that Bradley Cooper sings and it’s like a duet?” A speaker began playing “Shallow.” He followed up with: “Alexa, can you jump to the scene in the movie?” A nearby Fire TV opened the film “A Star Is Born,” right to the climactic scene. New Alexa Routines infer what you mean without an explicit request, like adjusting the temperature on your smart thermostat when you say you’re cold, or dimming the lights when you say it’s too bright, Panay said. You could already chat with Alexa, but now it looks smoother and easier. Notably, Panay’s demos were all live. Amazon says the new features will work with its own services plus those from the likes of GrubHub, OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Whole Foods Market (the supermarket chain owned by Amazon), Uber, Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max and smart home devices from companies like Philips Hue in the US - where Alexa+ will launch from March at US$19.99 per month, or free for subscribers to the US$14.99 per month Amazon Prime (which in the US is a more all-embracing service that includes deliveries). The no-extra cost touch will be appreciated by those annoyed by the approach taken by rivals (read: Tech Insider: Google follows Microsoft in raising prices as it bundles AI). Amazon plans to expand Alexa+ beyond the US but there’s no timeline at this point. The firm says it will supply more details on the local experience and pricing closer to its NZ launch. The launch was a bit delayed. Amazon was initially shaping up for an upgrade in late 2023, during the first wave of LLM hype around ChatGPT. But it still has breathing space. Apple has yet to add Apple Intelligence to its HomePods, while Google’s Gemini is still only available to a subset of its smart speaker users under a preview programme launched in December. The Elon Musk-driven Department of Government Efficiency has been lauded by some for employing a tech industry-style “move fast and break things” model. But according to a New York Times audit, its errors are piling up. DOGE has claimed US$65b in savings but has only itemised US$10b - and with that US10b there have been a number of gross exaggerations. In one case, DOGE listed a contract worth US$8 million as actually being worth US$8 billion. In another, it mistakenly counted the same US$655 million contract three times. In a third, it claimed it had saved $149 million by canceling a contract for three administrative assistants at the National Institutes of Health worth about $1.4 million. And then there’s a slew of contracts “cancelled” that actually expired years ago. For example, “While George W. Bush was president, the US Coast Guard signed a contract to get administrative help from a company in Northern Virginia. It paid $144,000, and the contract was completed by June 30, 2005,” the Times says. “Twenty years passed. Presidents came and went. “Last week, Elon Musk’s restructuring team, called the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, said it had just canceled the long-dead Coast Guard contract — and in doing so, saved U.S. taxpayers $53.7 million. There have been local examples, too. Wellington-based tech commentator Peter Griffin posted: “I got the following email from the US State Department over the weekend informing me that a grant a NZ charity I’m involved in was given by the State Department is being terminated.” Griffin added, “But the grant ended years ago and the money is already spent. I’d say a lot of cancelled programmes and funding is actually tidying up an out-of-date database. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley IN 1948 THERE WERE seven thousand people in Grinnell, Iowa, including more than one who didn’t dare take a drink in his own house without pulling the shades down first. It was against the law to sell liquor in Grinnell, but it was perfectly legal to drink it at home. So it wasn’t that. It wasn’t even that someone might look in through the window and disapprove. God knew Grinnell had more than its share of White Ribbon teetotalers, but by 1948 alcohol was hardly the mark of Cain it had once been. No, those timid souls with their fingers through the shade loops inside the white frame houses on Main Street and Park Street were thinking of something else altogether. They happened to live on land originally owned by the Congregational minister who had founded the town in 1854, Josiah Grinnell. Josiah Grinnell had sold off lots with covenants, in perpetuity, stating that anyone who allowed alcohol to be drunk on his property forfeited ownership. In perpetuity! In perpetuity was forever, and 1948 was not even a hundred years later. In 1948 there were people walking around Grinnell who had known Josiah Grinnell personally. They were getting old; Grinnell had died in 1891; but they were still walking around. So... why take a chance! The plain truth was, Grinnell had Middle West written all over it. It was squarely in the middle of Iowa’s Midland corn belt, where people on the farms said “crawdad” instead of crayfish and “barn lot” instead of barnyard. Grinnell had been one of many Protestant religious communities established in the mid-nineteenth century after Iowa became a state and settlers from the East headed for the farmlands. The streets were lineal with white clapboard houses and elm trees, like a New England village. And today, in 1948, the hard-scrubbed Octagon Soap smell of nineteenth-century Protestantism still permeated the houses and Main Street as well. That was no small part of what people in the East thought of when they heard the term “Middle West.” For thirty years writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Van Vechten had been prompting the most delicious sniggers with their portraits of the churchy, narrow-minded Middle West. The Iowa painter Grant Wood was thinking of farms like the ones around Grinnell when he did his famous painting American Gothic. Easterners recognized the grim, juiceless couple in Wood’s picture right away. There were John Calvin’s and John Knox’s rectitude reigning in the sticks. In the fall of 1948 Harry Truman picked out Grinnell as one of the stops on his whistle-stop campaign tour, one of the hamlets where he could reach out to the little people, the average Americans of the heartland, the people untouched by the sophisticated opinion-makers of New York and Washington. Speaking from the rear platform of his railroad car, Truman said he would never forget Grinnell, because it was Grinnell College, the little Congregational academy over on Park Street, that had given him his first honorary degree. The President’s fond recollection didn’t cut much ice, as it turned out. The town had voted Republican in every presidential election since the first time Abraham Lincoln ran, in 1860, and wasn’t about to change for Harry Truman. On the face of it, there you had Grinnell, Iowa, in 1948: a piece of mid-nineteenth-century American history frozen solid in the middle of the twentieth. It was one of the last towns in America that people back east would have figured to become the starting point of a bolt into the future that would create the very substructure, the electronic grid, of life in the year 2000 and beyond. On the other hand, it wouldn’t have surprised Josiah Grinnell in the slightest. IT WAS IN THE SUMMER of 1948 that Grant Gale, a forty-five-year-old physics professor at Grinnell College, ran across an item in the newspaper concerning a former classmate of his at the University of Wisconsin named John Bardeen. Bardeen’s father had been dean of medicine at Wisconsin, and Gale’s wife Harriet’s father had been dean of the engineering school, and so Bardeen and Harriet had grown up as fellow faculty brats, as the phrase went. Both Gale and Bardeen had majored in electrical engineering. Eventually Bardeen had taught physics at the University of Minnesota and had then left the academic world to work for Bell Laboratories, the telephone company’s main research center, in Murray Hill, New Jersey. And now, according to the item, Bardeen and another engineer at Bell, Walter Brattain, had invented a novel little device they called a transistor. It was only an item, however; the invention of the transistor in 1948 did not create headlines. The transistor apparently performed the same function as the vacuum tube, which was an essential component of telephone relay systems and radios. Like the vacuum tube, the transistor could isolate a specific electrical signal, such as a radio wave, and amplify it. But the transistor did not require glass tubing, a vacuum, a plate, or a cathode. It was nothing more than two minute gold wires leading to a piece of processed germanium less than a sixteenth of an inch long, shaped like a tiny brick. Germanium, an element found in coal, was an insulator, not a conductor. But if the germanium was contaminated with impurities, it became a “semiconductor.” A vacuum tube was also a semiconductor; the vacuum itself, like the germanium, was an insulator. But as every owner of a portable radio knew, vacuum tubes drew a lot of current, required a warm-up interval before they would work, and then got very hot. A transistor eliminated all these problems and, on top of that, was about fifty times smaller than a vacuum tube. So far, however, it was impossible to mass-produce transistors, partly because the gold wires had to be made by hand and attached by hand two thousandths of an inch apart. But that was the telephone company’s problem. Grant Gale wasn’t interested in any present or future applications of the transistor in terms of products. He hoped the transistor might offer a way to study the flow of electrons through a solid (the germanium), a subject physicists had speculated about for decades. He thought it would be terrific to get some transistors for his physics department at Grinnell. So he wrote to Bardeen at Bell Laboratories. Just to make sure his request didn’t get lost in the shuffle, he also wrote to the president of Bell Laboratories, Oliver Buckley. Buckley was from Sloane, Iowa, and happened to be a Grinnell graduate. So by the fall of 1948 Gale had obtained two of the first transistors ever made, and he presented the first academic instruction in solid-state electronics available anywhere in the world, for the benefit of the eighteen students majoring in physics at Grinnell College. One of Grant Gale’s senior physics majors was a local boy named Robert Noyce, whom Gale had known for years. Bob and his brothers, Donald, Gaylord, and Ralph, lived just down Park Street and used to rake leaves, mow the lawn, baby-sit, and do other chores for the Gales. Lately Grant Gale had done more than his share of agonizing over Bob Noyce. Like his brothers, Bob was a bright student, but he had just been thrown out of school for a semester, and it had taken every bit of credit Gale had in the local favor bank, not only with other faculty members but also with the sheriff, to keep the boy from being expelled for good and stigmatized with a felony conviction. Bob Noyce’s father, Ralph Sr., was a Congregational minister. Not only that, both of his grandfathers were Congregational ministers. But that hadn’t helped at all. In an odd way, after the thing happened, the boy’s clerical lineage had boomeranged on him. People were going around saying, “Well, what do you expect from a preacher’s son?” It was as if people in Grinnell unconsciously agreed with Sherwood Anderson that underneath the righteousness the midwestern Protestant preachers urged upon them, and which they themselves professed to uphold, lived demons of weakness, perversion, and hypocrisy that would break loose sooner or later. No one denied that the Noyce boys were polite and proper in all outward appearances. They were all members of the Boy Scouts. They went to Sunday School and the main Sunday service at the First Congregational Church and were active in the church youth groups. They were pumped full of Congregationalism until it was spilling over. Their father, although a minister, was not the minister of the First Congregational Church. He was the associate superintendent of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches, whose headquarters were at the college. The original purpose of the college had been to provide a good academic Congregational education, and many of the graduates became teachers. The Conference was a coordinating council rather than a governing body, since a prime tenet of the Congregational Church, embedded in its name, was that each congregation was autonomous. Congregationalists rejected the very idea of a church hierarchy. A Congregational minister was not supposed to be a father or even a shepherd but, rather, a teacher. Each member of the congregation was supposed to internalize the moral precepts of the church and be his own priest dealing directly with God. So the job of secretary of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches was anything but a position of power. It didn’t pay much either. The Noyces didn’t own their own house. They lived in a two-story white clapboard house that was owned by the church at Park Street and Tenth Avenue, at the college. Not having your own house didn’t carry the social onus in Grinnell that it did in the East. There was no upper crust in Grinnell. There were no top people who kept the social score in such matters. Congregationalists rejected the idea of a social hierarchy as fiercely as they did the idea of a religious hierarchy. The Congregationalists, like the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and United Brethren, were Dissenting Protestants. They were direct offshoots of the Separatists, who had split off from the Church of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and settled New England. At bottom, their doctrine of the autonomous congregation was derived from their hatred of the British system of class and status, with its endless gradations, topped off by the Court and the aristocracy. Even as late as 1948 the typical small town of the Middle West, like Grinnell, had nothing approaching a country club set. There were subtle differences in status in Grinnell, as in any other place, and it was better to be rich than poor, but there were only two obvious social ranks: those who were devout, educated, and hardworking, and those who weren’t. Genteel poverty did not doom one socially in Grinnell. Ostentation did. The Noyce boys worked at odd jobs to earn their pocket money. That was socially correct as well as useful. To have devoted the same time to taking tennis lessons or riding lessons would have been a gaffe in Grinnell. Donald, the oldest of the four boys, had done brilliantly at the college and had just received his Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University and was about to join the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. Gaylord, the second oldest, was teaching school in Turkey. Bob, who was a year younger than Gaylord, had done so well in science at Grinnell High School that Grant Gale had invited him to take the freshman physics course at the college during his high school senior year. He became one of Gale’s star students and most tireless laboratory workers from that time on. Despite his apparent passion for the scientific grind, Bob Noyce turned out to be that much-vaunted creature, the well-rounded student. He was a trim, muscular boy, five feet eight, with thick dark brown hair, a strong jawline, and a long, broad nose that gave him a rugged appearance. He was the star diver on the college swimming team and won the Midwest Conference championship in 1947. He sang in choral groups, played the oboe, and was an actor with the college dramatic society. He also acted in a radio drama workshop at the college, along with his friend Peter Hackes and some others who were interested in broadcasting, and was the leading man in a soap opera that was broadcast over station WOI in Ames, Iowa. Perhaps Bob Noyce was a bit too well rounded for local tastes. There were people who still remembered the business with the box kite back in 1941, when he was thirteen. It had been harmless, but it could have been a disaster. Bob had come across some plans for the building of a box kite, a kite that could carry a person aloft, in the magazine Popular Science. So he and Gaylord made a frame of cross-braced pine and covered it with a bolt of muslin. They tried to get the thing up by running across a field and towing it with a rope, but that didn’t work terribly well. Then they hauled it up on the roof of a barn, and Bob sat in the seat and Gaylord ran across the roof, pulling the kite, and Bob was lucky he didn’t break his neck when he and the rig hit the ground. So then they tied it to the rear bumper of a neighbor’s car. With the neighbor at the wheel, Bob rode the kite and managed to get about twelve feet off the ground and glide for thirty seconds or so and come down without wrecking himself or any citizen’s house or livestock. Livestock ... yes. Livestock was a major capital asset in Grinnell, and livestock was at the heart of what happened in 1948. In May a group of Bob Noyce’s friends in one of the dormitory houses at Grinnell decided to have a luau, and he was in on the planning. The Second World War had popularized the exotic ways of the South Pacific, so that in 1948 the luau was an up-to-the-minute social innovation. The centerpiece of a luau was a whole roasted suckling pig with an apple or a pineapple in its mouth. Bob Noyce, being strong and quick, was one of the two boys assigned to procure the pig. That night they sneaked onto a farm just outside of Grinnell and wrestled a twenty-five-pound suckling out of the pigpen and arrived back at the luau to great applause. Within a few hours the pig was crackling hot and had an apple in its mouth and looked good enough for seconds and thirds, which everybody helped himself to, and there was more applause. The next morning came the moral hangover. The two boys decided to go see the farmer, confess, and pay for the pig. They didn’t quite understand how a college luau, starring his pig, would score on the laugh meter with a farmer in midland Iowa. In the state of Iowa, where the vast majority of people depended upon agriculture for a livelihood and upon Protestant morality for their standards, not even stealing a watermelon worth thirty-five cents was likely to be written off as a boyish prank. Stealing a pig was larceny. The farmer got the sheriff and insisted on bringing criminal charges. There was only so much that Ralph Noyce, the preacher with the preacher’s son, could do. Grant Gale, on the other hand, was the calm, well-respected third party. He had two difficult tasks: to keep Bob out of jail and out of court and to keep the college administration from expelling him. There was never any hope at all of a mere slap on the wrist. The compromise Grant Gale helped work out—a one-semester suspension—was the best deal Bob could have hoped for realistically. The Night of the Luau Pig was quite a little scandal on the Grinnell Richter scale. So Gale was all the more impressed by the way Bob Noyce took it. The local deathray glowers never broke his confidence. All the Noyce boys had a profound and, to tell the truth, baffling confidence. Bob had a certain way of listening and staring. He would lower his head slightly and look up with a gaze that seemed to be about one hundred amperes. While he looked at you he never blinked and never swallowed. He absorbed everything you said and then answered very levelly in a soft baritone voice and often with a smile that showed off his terrific set of teeth. The stare, the voice, the smile—it was all a bit like the movie persona of the most famous of all Grinnell College’s alumni, Gary Cooper. With his strong face, his athlete’s build, and the Gary Cooper manner, Bob Noyce projected what psychologists call the halo effect. People with the halo effect seem to know exactly what they’re doing and, moreover, make you want to admire them for it. They make you see the halos over their heads. Years later people would naturally wonder where Bob Noyce got his confidence. Many came to the conclusion it was as much from his mother, Harriett Norton Noyce, as from his father. She was a latter-day version of the sort of strong-willed, intelligent, New England–style woman who had made such a difference during Iowa’s pioneer days a hundred years before. His mother and father, with the help of Rowland Cross, who taught mathematics at Grinnell, arranged for Bob to take a job in the actuarial department of Equitable Life in New York City for the summer. He stayed on at the job during the fall semester, then came back to Grinnell at Christmas and rejoined the senior class in January as the second semester began. Gale was impressed by the aplomb with which the prodigal returned. In his first three years Bob had accumulated so many extra credits, it would take him only this final semester to graduate. He resumed college life, including the extracurricular activities, without skipping a beat. But more than that, Gale was gratified by the way Bob became involved with the new experimental device that was absorbing so much of Gale’s own time: the transistor. Bob was not the only physics major interested in the transistor, but he was the one who seemed most curious about where this novel mechanism might lead. He went off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, in the fall to begin his graduate work. When he brought up the subject of the transistor at MIT, even to faculty members, people just looked at him. Even those who had heard of it regarded it merely as a novelty fabricated by the telephone company. There was no course work involving transistors or the theory of solid-state electronics. His dissertation was a “Photoelectric Study of Surface States on Insulators,” which was at best merely background for solid-state electronics. In this area MIT was far behind Grinnell College. For a good four years Grant Gale remained one of the few people Bob Noyce could compare notes with in this new field. Well, it had been a close one! What if Grant Gale hadn’t gone to school with John Bardeen, and what if Oliver Buckley hadn’t been a Grinnell alumnus? And what if Gale hadn’t bothered to get in touch with the two of them after he read the little squib about the transistor in the newspaper? What if he hadn’t gone to bat for Bob Noyce after the Night of the Luau Pig and the boy had been thrown out of college and that had been that? After all, if Bob hadn’t been able to finish at Grinnell, he probably never would have been introduced to the transistor. He certainly wouldn’t have come across it at MIT in 1948. Given what Bob Noyce did over the next twenty years, one couldn’t help but wonder about the fortuitous chain of events. Fortuitous ... well! How Josiah Grinnell, up on the plains of Heaven, must have laughed over that! GRANT GALE WAS the first important physicist in Bob Noyce’s career. The second was William Shockley. After their ambitions had collided one last time, and they had parted company, Noyce had concluded that he and Shockley were two very different people. But in many ways they were alike. For a start, they both had an amateur’s hambone love of being onstage. At MIT Noyce had sung in choral groups. Early in the summer of 1953, after he had received his Ph.D., he went over to Tufts College to sing and act in a program of musicals presented by the college. The costume director was a girl named Elizabeth Bottomley, from Barrington, Rhode Island, who had just graduated from Tufts, majoring in English. They both enjoyed dramatics. Singing, acting, and skiing had become the pastimes Noyce enjoyed most. He had become almost as expert at skiing as he had been at diving. Noyce and Betty, as he called her, were married that fall. In 1953 the MIT faculty was just beginning to understand the implications of the transistor. But electronics firms were already eager to have graduate electrical engineers who could do research and development in the new field. Noyce was offered jobs by Bell Laboratories, IBM, RCA, and Philco. He went to work for Philco, in Philadelphia, because Philco was starting from near zero in semiconductor research and chances for rapid advancement seemed good. But Noyce was well aware that the most important work was still being done at Bell Laboratories, thanks in no small part to William Shockley. Shockley had devised the first theoretical framework for research into solid-state semiconductors as far back as 1939 and was in charge of the Bell Labs team that included John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley had also originated the “junction transistor,” which turned the transistor from an exotic laboratory instrument into a workable item. By 1955 Shockley had left Bell and returned to Palo Alto, California, where he had grown up near Stanford University, to form his own company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, with start-up money provided by Arnold Beckman of Beckman Instruments. Shockley opened up shop in a glorified shed on South San Antonio Road in Mountain View, which was just south of Palo Alto. The building was made of concrete blocks with the rafters showing. Aside from clerical and maintenance personnel, practically all the employees were electrical engineers with doctorates. In a field this experimental there was nobody else worth hiring. Shockley began talking about “my Ph.D. production line.” Meanwhile, Noyce was not finding Philco the golden opportunity he thought it would be. Philco wanted good enough transistors to stay in the game with GE and RCA, but it was not interested in putting money into the sort of avant-garde research Noyce had in mind. In 1956 he resigned from Philco and moved from Pennsylvania to California to join Shockley. The way he went about it was a classic example of the Noyce brand of confidence. By now he and his wife, Betty, had two children: Bill, who was two, and Penny, who was six months old. After a couple of telephone conversations with Shockley, Noyce put himself and Betty on a night flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco. They arrived in Palo Alto at six a.m. By noon Noyce had signed a contract to buy a house. That afternoon he went to Mountain View to see Shockley and ask for a job, projected the halo, and got it. The first months on Shockley’s Ph.D. production line were exhilarating. It wasn’t really a production line at all. Everything at this stage was research. Every day a dozen young Ph.D.s came to the shed at eight in the morning and began heating germanium and silicon, another common element, in kilns to temperatures ranging from 1,472 to 2,552 degrees Fahrenheit. They wore white lab coats, goggles, and work gloves. When they opened the kiln doors weird streaks of orange and white light went across their faces, and they put in the germanium or the silicon, along with specks of aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic. Contaminating the germanium or silicon with the aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic was called doping. Then they lowered a small mechanical column into the goo so that crystals formed on the bottom of the column, and they pulled the crystal out and tried get a grip on it with tweezers, and put it under microscopes and cut it with diamond cutters, among other things, into minute slices, wafers, chips—there were no names in electronics for these tiny forms. The kilns cooked and bubbled away, doors opened, the pale apricot light streaked over the goggles, the tweezers and diamond cutters flashed, the white coats flapped, the Ph.D.s squinted through their microscopes, and Shockley moved between the tables conducting the arcane symphony. In pensive moments Shockley looked very much the scholar, with his roundish face, his roundish eyeglasses, and his receding hairline—but Shockley was not a man locked in the pensive mode. He was an enthusiast, a raconteur, and a showman. At the outset his very personality was enough to keep everyone swept up in the great adventure. When he lectured, as he often did at colleges and before professional groups, he would walk up to the lectern and thank the master of ceremonies and say that the only more flattering introduction he had ever received was one he gave himself one night when the emcee didn’t show up, whereupon—bango—a bouquet of red roses would pop up in his hand. Or he would walk up to the lectern and say that tonight he was getting into a hot subject, whereupon he would open up a book and—whumpf!—a puff of smoke would rise up out of the pages. Shockley was famous for his homely but shrewd examples. One day a student confessed to being puzzled by the concept of amplification, which was one of the prime functions of the transistor. Shockley told him: “If you take a bale of hay and tie it to the tail of a mule and then strike a match and set the bale of hay on fire, and if you then compare the energy expended shortly thereafter by the mule with the energy expended by yourself in the striking of the match, you will understand the concept of amplification.” On November 1, 1956, Shockley arrived at the shed on South San Antonio Road beaming. Early that morning he had received a telephone call informing him that he had won the Nobel Prize for physics for the invention of the transistor; or, rather, that he was co-winner, along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley closed up shop and took everybody to a restaurant called Dinah’s Shack over on El Camino Real, the road to San Francisco that had become Palo Alto’s commercial strip. He treated his Ph.D. production line and all the other employees to a champagne breakfast. It seemed that Shockley’s father was a mining engineer who spent years out on remote durango terrains, in Nevada, Manchuria—all over the world. Shockley’s mother was like Noyce’s. She was an intelligent woman with a commanding will. The Shockleys were Unitarians, the Unitarian Church being an offshoot of the Congregational. Shockley Sr. was twenty years older than Shockley’s mother and died when Shockley was seventeen. Shockley’s mother was determined that her son would someday “set the world on fire,” as she once put it. And now he had done it. Shockley lifted a glass of champagne in Dinah’s Shack, and it was as if it were a toast back across a lot of hard-wrought durango grit Octagon Soap sagebrush Dissenting Protestant years to his father’s memory and his mother’s determination. That had been a great day at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. There weren’t many more. Shockley was magnetic, he was a genius, and he was a great research director—the best, in fact. His forte was breaking a problem down to first principles. With a few words and a few lines on a piece of paper he aimed any experiment in the right direction. When it came to comprehending the young engineers on his Ph.D. production line, however, he was not so terrific. It never seemed to occur to Shockley that his twelve highly educated elves just might happen to view themselves the same way he had always viewed himself: which is to say, as young geniuses capable of the sort of inventions Nobel Prizes were given for. One day Noyce came to Shockley with some new results he had found in the laboratory. Shockley picked up the telephone and called some former colleagues at Bell Labs to see if they sounded right. Shockley never even realized that Noyce had gone away from his desk seething. Then there was the business of the new management techniques. Now that he was an entrepreneur, Shockley came up with some new ways to run a company. Each one seemed to irritate the elves more than the one before. For a start, Shockley published their salaries. He posted them on a bulletin board. That way there would be no secrets. Then he started having the employees rate one another on a regular basis. These were so-called peer ratings, a device sometimes used in the military and seldom appreciated even there. Everybody regarded peer ratings as nothing more than popularity contests. But the real turning point was the lie detector. Shockley was convinced that someone in the shed was sabotaging the project. The work was running into inexplicable delays, but the money was running out on schedule. So he insisted that one employee roll up his sleeve and bare his chest and let the electrodes be attached and submit to a polygraph examination. No saboteur was ever found. There were also some technical differences of opinion. Shockley was interested in developing a so-called four-layer diode. Noyce and two of his fellow elves, Gordon Moore and Jean Hoerni, favored transistors. But at bottom it was dissatisfaction with the boss and the lure of entrepreneurship that led to what happened next. In the summer of 1957 Moore, Hoerni, and five other engineers—but not Noyce—got together and arrived at what became one of the primary business concepts of the young semiconductor industry. In this business, it dawned on them, capital assets in the traditional sense of plant, equipment, and raw materials counted for next to nothing. The only plant you needed was a shed big enough for the worktables. The only equipment you needed was some kilns, goggles, microscopes, tweezers, and diamond cutters. The materials, silicon and germanium, came from dirt and coal. Brainpower was the entire franchise. If the seven of them thought they could do the job better than Shockley, there was nothing to keep them from starting their own company. On that day was born the concept that would make the semiconductor business as wild as show business: defection capital. The seven defectors went to the Wall Street firm of Hayden Stone in search of start-up money. It was at this point that they realized they had to have someone serve as administrator. So they turned to Noyce, who was still with Shockley. None of them, including Noyce, had any administrative experience, but they all thought of Noyce as soon as the question came up. They didn’t know exactly what they were looking for ... but Noyce was the one with the halo. He agreed to join them. He would continue to wear a white lab coat and goggles and do research. But he would also be the coordinator. Of the eight of them, he would be the one man who kept track, on a regular basis, of all sides of the operation. He was twenty-nine years old. Arthur Rock of Hayden Stone approached twenty-two firms before he finally hooked the defectors up with the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation of New York. Fairchild was owned by Sherman Fairchild, a bachelor bon vivant who lived in a futuristic town house on East Sixty-fifth Street in Manhattan. The house was in two sections connected by ramps. The ramps were fifty feet long in some cases, enclosed in glass so that you could go up and down the ramps in all weather and gaze upon the marble courtyard below. The place looked like something from out of the Crystal Palace of Ming in Flash Gordon. The ramps were for his Aunt May, who lived with him and was confined to a wheelchair and had even more Fairchild money than he did. The chief executive officer of Fairchild was John Carter, who had just come from the Corning Glass Company. He had been the youngest vice-president in the history of that old-line, family-owned firm. He was thirty-six. Fairchild Camera and Instrument gave the defectors the money to start up the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, with the understanding that Fairchild Camera and Instrument would have the right to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million at any time within the next eight years. Shockley took the defections very hard. He seemed as much hurt as angered, and he was certainly angry enough. A friend of Shockley’s said to Noyce’s wife, Betty: “You must have known about this for quite some time. How on earth could you not tell me?” That was a baffling remark, unless one regarded Shockley as the father of the transistor and the defectors as the children he had taken beneath his mantle of greatness. If so, one had a point. Years later, if anyone had drawn up a family tree for the semiconductor industry, practically every important branch would have led straight from Shockley’s shed on South San Antonio Road. On the other hand, Noyce had been introduced to the transistor not by Shockley but by John Bardeen, via Grant Gale, and not in California but back in his own hometown, Grinnell, Iowa. For that matter, Josiah Grinnell had been a defector in his day, too, and there was no record that he had ever lost a night’s sleep over it. NOYCE, GORDON MOORE, Jean Hoerni, and the other five defectors set up Fairchild Semiconductor in a two-story warehouse building some speculator had built out of tilt-up concrete slabs on Charleston Avenue in Mountain View, about twelve blocks from Shockley’s operation. Mountain View was in the northern end of the Santa Clara Valley. In the business world the valley was known mainly for its apricot, pear, and plum orchards. From the work bays of the light-industry sheds that the speculators were beginning to build in the valley you could look out and see the raggedy little apricot trees they had never bothered to bulldoze after they bought the land from the farmers. A few well-known electronics firms were already in the valley: General Electric and IBM, as well as a company that had started up locally, Hewlett-Packard. Stanford University was encouraging engineering concerns to locate near Palo Alto and use the university’s research facilities. The man who ran the program was a friend of Shockley’s, Frederick E. Terman, whose father had originated the first scientific measurement of human intelligence, the Stanford-Binet IQ test. IBM had a facility in the valley that was devoted specifically to research rather than production. Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard were trying to develop a highly esoteric and colossally expensive new device, the electronic computer. Shockley had been the first entrepreneur to come to the area to make semiconductors. After the defections his operation never got off the ground. Here in the Santa Clara Valley, that left the field to Noyce and the others at Fairchild. Fairchild’s start-up couldn’t have come at a better time. By 1957 there was sufficient demand from manufacturers who merely wanted transistors instead of vacuum tubes, for use in radios and other machines, to justify the new operation. But it was also in 1957 that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I. In the electronics industry the ensuing space race had the effect of coupling two new inventions—the transistor and the computer—and magnifying the importance of both. The first American electronic computer, known as ENIAC, had been developed by the Army during the Second World War, chiefly as a means of computing artillery and bomb trajectories. The machine was a monster. It was one hundred feet long and ten feet high and required eighteen thousand vacuum tubes. The tubes generated so much heat, the temperature in the room sometimes reached 120 degrees. What the government needed was small computers that could be installed in rockets to provide automatic onboard guidance. Substituting transistors for vacuum tubes was an obvious way to cut down on the size. After Sputnik I the glamorous words in the semiconductor business were computers and miniaturization. Other than Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild was the only semiconductor company in the Santa Clara Valley, but Texas Instruments had entered the field in Dallas, as had Motorola in Phoenix and Transitron and Raytheon in the Boston area, where a new electronics industry was starting up as MIT finally began to comprehend the new technology. These firms were all racing to refine the production of transistors to the point where they might command the market. So far refinement had not been anybody’s long suit. No tourist dropping by Fairchild, Texas Instruments, Motorola, or Transitron would have had the faintest notion he was looking in on the leading edge of the most advanced of all industries, electronics. The work bays, where the transistors were produced, looked like slightly sunnier versions of the garment sweatshops of San Francisco’s Chinatown. Here were rows of women hunched over worktables, squinting through microscopes, doing the most tedious and frustrating sort of manual labor, cutting layers of silicon apart with diamond cutters, picking little rectangles of them up with tweezers, trying to attach wires to them, dropping them, rummaging around on the floor to find them again, swearing, muttering, climbing back up to their chairs, rubbing their eyes, squinting back through the microscopes, and driving themselves crazy some more. Depending on how well the silicon or germanium had been cooked and doped, anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the transistors would turn out to be defective even after all that, and sometimes the good ones would be the ones that fell on the floor and got ruined. Even for a machine as simple as a radio the individual transistors had to be wired together, by hand, until you ended up with a little panel that looked like a road map of West Virginia. As for a computer—the wires inside a computer were sheer spaghetti. Noyce had figured out a solution. But fabricating it was another matter. There was something primitive about cutting individual transistors out of sheets of silicon and then wiring them back together in various series. Why not put them all on a single piece of silicon without wires? The problem was that you would also have to carve, etch, coat, and otherwise fabricate the silicon to perform all the accompanying electrical functions as well, the functions ordinarily performed by insulators, rectifiers, resistors, and capacitors. You would have to create an entire electrical system, an entire circuit, on a little wafer or chip. Noyce realized that he was not the only engineer thinking along these lines, but he had never even heard of Jack Kilby. Kilby was a thirty-six-year-old engineer working for Texas Instruments in Dallas. In January 1959 Noyce made his first detailed notes about a complete solid-state circuit. A month later Texas Instruments announced that Jack Kilby had invented one. Kilby’s integrated circuit, as the invention was called, was made of germanium. Six months later Noyce created a similar integrated circuit made of silicon and using a novel insulating process developed by Jean Hoerni. Noyce’s silicon device turned out to be more efficient and more practical to produce than Kilby’s and set the standard for the industry. So Noyce became known as the co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Nevertheless, Kilby had unquestionably been first. There was an ironic echo of Shockley here. Strictly speaking, Bardeen and Brattain, not Shockley, had invented the transistor, but Shockley wasn’t bashful about being known as the co-inventor. And now, eleven years later, Noyce wasn’t turning bashful, either. Noyce knew exactly what he possessed in this integrated circuit, or microchip, as the press would call it. Noyce knew that he had discovered the road to El Dorado. El Dorado was the vast, still-virgin terrain of electricity. Electricity was already so familiar a part of everyday life, only a few research engineers understood just how young and unexplored the terrain actually was. It had been only eighty years since Edison invented the light bulb in 1879. It had been less than fifty years since Lee De Forest, an inventor from Council Bluffs, Iowa, had invented the vacuum tube. The vacuum tube was based on the light bulb, but the vacuum tube opened up fields the light bulb did not even suggest: long-distance radio and telephone communication. Over the past ten years, since Bardeen and Brattain invented it in 1948, the transistor had become the modern replacement for the vacuum tube. And now came Kilby’s and Noyce’s integrated circuit. The integrated circuit was based on the transistor, but the integrated circuit opened up fields the transistor did not even suggest. The integrated circuit made it possible to create miniature computers, to put all the functions of the mighty ENIAC on a panel the size of a playing card. Thereby the integrated circuit opened up every field of engineering imaginable, from voyages to the moon to robots, and many fields that had never been imagined, such as electronic guidance counseling. It opened up so many fields that no one could even come up with a single name to include them all. “The second industrial revolution,” “the age of the computer,” “the microchip universe,” “the electronic grid”—none of them, not even the handy neologism “high tech,” could encompass all the implications. The importance of the integrated circuit was certainly not lost on John Carter and Fairchild Camera back in New York. In 1959 they exercised their option to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million. The next day Noyce, Moore, Hoerni, and the other five former Shockley elves woke up rich, or richer than they had ever dreamed of being. Each received $250,000 worth of Fairchild stock. Josiah Grinnell grew livid on the subject of alcohol. But he had nothing against money. He would have approved. NOYCE DIDN’T KNOW what to make of his new wealth. He was thirty-one years old. For the past four years, ever since he had gone to work for Shockley, the semiconductor business had not seemed like a business at all but an esoteric game in which young electrical engineers competed for attaboys and the occasional round of applause after delivering a paper before the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It was a game supercharged by the fact that it was being played in the real world, to use a term that annoyed scientists in the universities. Someone—Arnold Beckman, Sherman Fairchild, whoever—was betting real money, and other bands of young elves, at Texas Instruments, RCA, Bell, were out there competing with you by the real world’s rules, which required that you be practical as well as brilliant. Noyce started working for Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 for twelve thousand dollars a year. When it came to money, he had assumed that he, like his father, would always be on somebody’s payroll. Now, in 1959, when he talked to his father, he told him: “The money doesn’t seem real. It’s just a way of keeping score.” Noyce took his family to visit his parents fairly often. He and Betty now had three children, Bill, Penny, and Polly, who was a year old. When they visited the folks, they went off to church on Sunday with the folks, as if it were all very much a part of their lives. In fact, Noyce had started drifting away from Congregationalism and the whole matter of churchgoing after he entered MIT. It was not a question of rejecting it. He never rejected anything about his upbringing in Grinnell. It was just that he was heading off somewhere else, down a different road. In that respect Noyce was like a great many bright young men and women from Dissenting Protestant families in the Middle West after the Second World War. They had been raised as Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, United Brethren, whatever. They had been led through the church door and prodded toward religion, but it had never come alive for them. Sundays made their skulls feel like dried-out husks. So they slowly walked away from the church and silently, without so much as a growl of rebellion, congratulated themselves on their independence of mind and headed into another way of life. Only decades later, in most cases, would they discover how, absentmindedly, inexplicably, they had brought the old ways along for the journey nonetheless. It was as if ... through some extraordinary mistake ... they had been sewn into the linings of their coats! Now that he had some money, Bob Noyce bought a bigger house. His and Betty’s fourth child, Margaret, was born in 1960, and they wanted each child to have a bedroom. But the thought of moving into any of the “best” neighborhoods in the Palo Alto area never even crossed his mind. The best neighborhoods were to be found in Atherton, in Burlingame, which was known as very social; or in the swell old sections of Palo Alto, near Stanford University. Instead, Noyce bought a California version of a French country house in Los Altos, a white stucco house with a steeply pitched roof. It was scenic up there in the hills, and cooler in the summer than it was down in the flatlands near the bay. The house had plenty of room, and he and Betty would be living a great deal better than most couples their age, but Los Altos had no social cachet and the house was not going to make House & Garden come banging on the door. No one could accuse them of being ostentatious. John Carter appointed Noyce general manager of the entire division, Fairchild Semiconductor, which was suddenly one of the hottest new outfits in the business world. NASA chose Noyce’s integrated circuits for the first computers that astronauts would use on board their spacecraft (in the Gemini program). After that, orders poured in. In ten years Fairchild sales rose from a few thousand dollars a year to $130 million, and the number of employees rose from the original band of elves to twelve thousand. As the general manager, Noyce now had to deal with a matter Shockley had dealt with clumsily and prematurely, namely, new management techniques for this new industry. One day John Carter came to Mountain View for a close look at Noyce’s semiconductor operation. Carter’s office in Syosset, Long Island, arranged for a limousine and chauffeur to be at his disposal while he was in California. So Carter arrived at the tilt-up concrete building in Mountain View in the back of a black Cadillac limousine with a driver in the front wearing the complete chauffeur’s uniform—the black suit, the white shirt, the black necktie, and the black visored cap. That in itself was enough to turn heads at Fairchild Semiconductor. Nobody had ever seen a limousine and a chauffeur out there before. But that wasn’t what fixed the day in everybody’s memory. It was the fact that the driver stayed out there for almost eight hours, doing nothing. He stayed out there in his uniform, with his visored hat on, in the front seat of the limousine, all day, doing nothing but waiting for a man who was somewhere inside. John Carter was inside having a terrific chief executive officer’s time for himself. He took a tour of the plant, he held conferences, he looked at figures, he nodded with satisfaction, he beamed his urbane Fifty-seventh Street Biggie CEO charm. And the driver sat out there all day engaged in the task of supporting a visored cap with his head. People started leaving their workbenches and going to the front windows just to take a look at this phenomenon. It seemed that bizarre. Here was a serf who did nothing all day but wait outside a door in order to be at the service of the haunches of his master instantly, whenever those haunches and the paunch and the jowls might decide to reappear. It wasn’t merely that this little peek at the New York–style corporate high life was unusual out here in the brown hills of the Santa Clara Valley. It was that it seemed terribly wrong. A certain instinct Noyce had about this new industry and the people who worked in it began to take on the outlines of a concept. Corporations in the East adopted a feudal approach to organization, without even being aware of it. There were kings and lords, and there were vassals, soldiers, yeomen, and serfs, with layers of protocol and perquisites, such as the car and driver, to symbolize superiority and establish the boundary lines. Back east the CEOs had offices with carved paneling, fake fireplaces, escritoires, bergères, leather-bound books, and dressing rooms, like a suite in a baronial manor house. Fairchild Semiconductor needed a strict operating structure, particularly in this period of rapid growth, but it did not need a social structure. In fact, nothing could be worse. Noyce realized how much he detested the eastern corporate system of class and status with its endless gradations, topped off by the CEOs and vice-presidents who conducted their daily lives as if they were a corporate court and aristocracy. He rejected the idea of a social hierarchy at Fairchild. Not only would there be no limousines and chauffeurs, there would not even be any reserved parking places. Work began at eight a.m. for one and all, and it would be first come, first served, in the parking lot, for Noyce, Gordon Moore, Jean Hoerni, and everybody else. “If you come late,” Noyce liked to say, “you just have to park in the back forty.” And there would be no baronial office suites. The glorified warehouse on Charleston Road was divided into work bays and a couple of rows of cramped office cubicles. The cubicles were never improved. The decor remained Glorified Warehouse, and the doors were always open. Half the time Noyce, the chief administrator, was out in the laboratory anyway, wearing his white lab coat. Noyce came to work in a coat and tie, but soon the jacket and the tie were off, and that was fine for any other man in the place too. There were no rules of dress at all, except for some unwritten ones. Dress should be modest, modest in the social as well as the moral sense. At Fairchild there were no hard-worsted double-breasted pinstripe suits and shepherd’s-check neckties. Sharp, elegant, fashionable, or alluring dress was a social blunder. Shabbiness was not a sin. Ostentation was. During the start-up phase at Fairchild Semiconductor there had been no sense of bosses and employees. There had been only a common sense of struggle out on a frontier. Everyone had internalized the goals of the venture. They didn’t need exhortations from superiors. Besides, everyone had been so young! Noyce, the administrator or chief coordinator or whatever he should be called, had been just about the oldest person on the premises, and he had been barely thirty. And now, in the early 1960s, thanks to his athletic build and his dark brown hair with the Campus Kid hairline, he still looked very young. As Fairchild expanded, Noyce didn’t even bother trying to find “experienced management personnel.” Out here in California, in the semiconductor industry, they didn’t exist. Instead, he recruited engineers right out of the colleges and graduate schools and gave them major responsibilities right off the bat. There was no “staff,” no “top management” other than the eight partners themselves. Major decisions were not bucked up a chain of command. Noyce held weekly meetings of people from all parts of the operation, and whatever had to be worked out was worked out right there in the room. Noyce wanted them all to keep internalizing the company’s goals and to provide their own motivations, just as they had during the start-up phase. If they did that, they would have the capacity to make their own decisions. The young engineers who came to work for Fairchild could scarcely believe how much responsibility was suddenly thrust upon them. Some twenty-four-year-old just out of graduate school would find himself in charge of a major project with no one looking over his shoulder. A problem would come up, and he couldn’t stand it, and he would go to Noyce and hyperventilate and ask him what to do. And Noyce would lower his head, turn on his 100-ampere eyes, listen, and say: “Look, here are your guidelines. You’ve got to consider A, you’ve got to consider B, and you’ve got to consider C.” Then he would turn on the Gary Cooper smile: “But if you think I’m going to make your decision for you, you’re mistaken. Hey ... it’s your ass.” Back east, in the conventional corporation, any functionary wishing to make an unusually large purchase had to have the approval of a superior or two or three superiors or even a committee, a procedure that ate up days, weeks, in paperwork. Noyce turned that around. At Fairchild any engineer, even a weenie just out of Cal Tech, could make any purchase he wanted, no matter how enormous, unless someone else objected strongly enough to try to stop it. Noyce called this the Short Circuit Paper Route. There was only one piece of paper involved, the piece of paper the engineer handed somebody in the purchasing department. The spirit of the start-up phase! My God! Who could forget the exhilarations of the past few years! To be young and free out here on the silicon frontier! Noyce was determined to maintain that spirit during the expansion phase. And for the time being, at least, here in the early 1960s the notion of a permanent start-up operation didn’t seem too farfetched. Fairchild was unable to coast on the tremendous advantage Noyce’s invention of the integrated circuit had provided. Competitors were setting up shop in the Santa Clara Valley like gold rushers. And where did they come from? Why, from Fairchild itself! And how could that be? Nothing to it ... Defection capital! Defectors (or redefectors) from Fairchild started up more than fifty companies, all making or supplying microchips. Raytheon Semiconductor, Signetics, General Microelectronics, Intersil, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualidyne—off they spun, each with a sillier pseudotech engineerologism for a name than the one before. Defectors! What a merry game that was. Jean Hoerni and three of the other original eight defectors from Shockley defected from Fairchild to form what would soon become known as Teledyne Semiconductors, and that was only round one. After all, why not make all the money for yourself! The urge to use defection capital was so irresistible that the word defection, with its note of betrayal, withered away. Defectors were merely the Fairchildren, as Adam Smith dubbed them. Occasionally defectors from other companies, such as the men from Texas Instruments and Westinghouse who started Siliconix, moved into the Santa Clara Valley to join the free-for-all. But it was the Fairchildren who turned the Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley. Acre by acre the fruit trees were uprooted, and two-story Silicon Modern office buildings and factories went up. The state of California built a new freeway past the area, Route 280. Children heard the phrase “Silicon Valley” so often, they grew up thinking it was the name on the map. Everywhere the Fairchild émigrés went, they took the Noyce approach with them. It wasn’t enough to start up a company; you had to start up a community, a community in which there were no social distinctions, and it was first come, first served, in the parking lot, and everyone was supposed to internalize the common goals. The atmosphere of the new companies was so democratic, it startled businessmen from the East. Some fifty-five-year-old biggie with his jowls swelling up smoothly from out of his F. R. Tripler modified-spread white collar and silk jacquard-print necktie would call up from GE or RCA and say, “This is Harold B. Thatchwaite,” and the twenty-three-year-old secretary on the other end of the line, out in the Silicon Valley, would say in one of those sunny blond pale-blue-eyed California voices: “Just a minute, Hal, Jack will be right with you.” And once he got to California and met this Jack for the first time, there he would be, the CEO himself, all of thirty-three years old, wearing no jacket, no necktie, just a checked shirt, khaki pants, and a pair of moccasins with welted seams the size of jumper cables. Naturally the first sounds out of this Jack’s mouth would be: “Hi, Hal.” It was the 1960s, and people in the East were hearing a lot about California surfers, California bikers, hot rodders, car customizers, California hippies, and political protesters, and the picture they got was of young people in jeans and T-shirts who were casual, spontaneous, impulsive, emotional, sensual, undisciplined, and obnoxiously proud of it. So these semiconductor outfits in the Silicon Valley with their CEOs dressed like camp counselors struck them as the business versions of the same thing. They couldn’t have been more wrong. The new breed of the Silicon Valley lived for work. They were disciplined to the point of back spasms. They worked long hours and kept working on weekends. They became absorbed in their companies the way men once had in the palmy days of the automobile industry. In the Silicon Valley a young engineer would go to work at eight in the morning, work right through lunch, leave the plant at six-thirty or seven, drive home, play with the baby for half an hour, have dinner with his wife, get in bed with her, give her a quick toss, then get up and leave her there in the dark and work at his desk for two or three hours on “a coupla things I had to bring home with me.” Or else he would leave the plant and decide, well, maybe he would drop in at the Wagon Wheel for a drink before he went home. Every year there was some place, the Wagon Wheel, Chez Yvonne, Rickey’s, the Roundhouse, where members of this esoteric fraternity, the young men and women of the semiconductor industry, would head after work to have a drink and gossip and brag and trade war stories about phase jitters, phantom circuits, bubble memories, pulse trains, bounceless contacts, burst modes, leapfrog tests, p-n junctions, sleeping-sickness modes, slow-death episodes, RAMs, NAKs, MOSes, PCMs, PROMs, PROM blowers, PROM burners, PROM blasters, and teramagnitudes, meaning multiples of a million millions. So then he wouldn’t get home until nine, and the baby was asleep, and dinner was cold, and the wife was frosted off, and he would stand there and cup his hands as if making an imaginary snowball and try to explain to her ... while his mind trailed off to other matters, LSIs, VLSIs, alpha flux, de-rezzing, forward biases, parasitic signals, and that tera-sexy little cookie from Signetics he had met at the Wagon Wheel, who understood such things. It was not a great way of life for marriages. By the late 1960s the toll of divorces seemed to those in the business to be as great as that of NASA’s boomtowns, Cocoa Beach, Florida, and Clear Lake, Texas, where other young engineers were giving themselves over to a new technology as if it were a religious mission. The second time around they tended to “intra-marry.” They married women who worked for Silicon Valley companies and who could comprehend and even learn to live with their twenty-four-hour obsessions. In the Silicon Valley an engineer was under pressure to reinvent the integrated circuit every six months. In 1959 Noyce’s invention had made it possible to put an entire electrical circuit on a chip of silicon the size of a fingernail. By 1964 you had to know how to put ten circuits on a chip that size just to enter the game, and the stakes kept rising. Six years later the figure was one thousand circuits on a single chip; six years after that it would be thirty-two thousand—and everyone was talking about how the real breakthrough would be sixty-four thousand. Noyce himself led the race; by 1968 he had a dozen new integrated-circuit and transistor patents. And what amazing things such miniaturization made possible! In December 1968 NASA sent the first manned flight to the moon, Apollo 8. Three astronauts, Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders, flew into earth orbit, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the earth’s gravitational field and fly through the minute “window” in space that would put them on course to the moon rather than into orbit around the sun, from which there could be no return. They flew to the moon, went into orbit around it, saw the dark side, which no one had ever seen, not even with a telescope, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the moon’s gravitational pull and go into the proper trajectory for their return to earth. None of it would have been possible without onboard computers. People were beginning to talk about all that the space program was doing for the computer sciences. Noyce knew it was the other way around. Only the existence of a miniature computer two feet long, one foot wide, and six inches thick—exactly three thousand times smaller than the old ENIAC and far faster and more reliable—made the flight of Apollo 8 possible. And there would have been no miniature computer without the integrated circuits invented by Noyce and Kilby and refined by Noyce and the young semiconductor zealots of the Silicon Valley, the new breed who were building the road El Dorado. Noyce used to go into a slow burn that year, 1968, when the newspapers, the magazines, and the television networks got on the subject of the youth. The youth was a favorite topic in 1968. Riots broke out on the campuses as the antiwar movement reached its peak following North Vietnam’s Tet offensive. Black youths rioted in the cities. The Yippies, supposedly a coalition of hippies and campus activists, managed to sabotage the Democratic National Convention by setting off some highly televised street riots. The press seemed to enjoy presenting these youths as the avant-garde who were sweeping aside the politics and morals of the past and shaping America’s future. The French writer Jean-Francois Revel toured American campuses and called the radical youth homo novus, “the New Man,” as if they were the latest, most advanced product of human evolution itself, after the manner of the superchildren in Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End. Homo novus? As Noyce saw it, these so-called radical youth movements were shot through with a yearning for a preindustrial Arcadia. They wanted, or thought they wanted, to return to the earth and live on organic vegetables and play folk songs from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They were antitechnology. They looked upon science as an instrument monopolized by the military-industrial complex. They used this phrase, “the military-industrial complex,” all the time. If industry or the military underwrote scientific research in the universities—and they underwrote a great deal of it—then that research was evil. The universities were to be pure and above exploitation, except, of course, by ideologues of the Left. The homo novus had set up a chain of logic that went as follows: since science equals the military-industrial complex, and the military-industrial complex equals capitalism, and capitalism equals fascism, therefore science equals fascism. And therefore, these much-vaunted radical youths, these shapers of the future, attacked the forward positions of American technology, including the space program and the very idea of the computer. And therefore these creators of the future were what? They were Luddites. They wanted to destroy the new machines. They were the reactionaries of the new age. They were an avant-garde to the rear. They wanted to call off the future. They were stillborn, ossified, prematurely senile. If you wanted to talk about the creators of the future—well, here they were! Here in the Silicon Valley! Just before Apollo 8 circled the moon, Bob Noyce turned forty-one. By age forty-one he had become such a good skier, people were urging him to enter competitions. He had taken up hang gliding and scuba diving. When his daughter Penny was almost fourteen, he asked her what she wanted for her birthday, and she said she wanted to drop from an airplane by parachute. Noyce managed to convince her to settle for glider lessons instead. Then, because it made him restless to just stand around an airfield and watch her soar up above, he took flying lessons, bought an airplane, and began flying the family up through the mountain passes to Aspen, Colorado, for skiing weekends. He had the same lean, powerful build as he had had twenty years before, when he was on the swimming team at Grinnell College. He had the same thick dark brown hair and the same hairline. It looked as if every hair in his head were nailed in. He looked as if he could walk out the door any time he wanted to and win another Midwest Conference diving championship. And he was one of the oldest CEOs in the semiconductor business! He was the Edison of the bunch! He was the father of the Silicon Valley! The rest of the hotshots were younger. It was a business dominated by people in their twenties and thirties. In the Silicon Valley there was a phenomenon known as burnout. After five or ten years of obsessive racing for the semiconductor high stakes, five or ten years of lab work; work lunches, workaholic drinks at the Wagon Wheel, and work-battering of the wife and children, an engineer would reach his middle thirties and wake up one day—and he was finished. The game was over. It was called burnout, suggesting mental and physical exhaustion brought about by overwork. But Noyce was convinced it was something else entirely. It was ... age, or age and status. In the semiconductor business, research engineering was like pitching in baseball; it was 60 percent of the game. Semiconductor research was one of those highly mathematical sciences, such as microbiology, in which, for reasons one could only guess at, the great flashes, the critical moments of inspiration, came mainly to those who were young, often to men in their twenties. The thirty-five-year-old burnouts weren’t suffering from exhaustion, as Noyce saw it. They were being overwhelmed, outperformed, by the younger talent coming up behind them. It wasn’t the central nervous system that was collapsing, it was the ego. Now here you saw youth in the vanguard, on the leading edge! Here you saw the youths who were, in fact, shaping the future! Here you saw, if you insisted on the term, the homo novus! But why insist? For they were also of the same stripe as Josiah Grinnell, who had founded Grinnell, Iowa, at the age of thirty-three. IT WAS IN 1968 that Noyce pulled off the redefection of all redefections. Fairchild Semiconductors had generated tremendous profits for the parent company back east. It now appeared to Noyce that John Carter and Sherman Fairchild had been diverting too much of that money into new start-up ventures, outside the semiconductor field. As a matter of fact, Noyce disliked many things “back east.” He disliked the periodic trips to New York, for which he dressed in gray suits, white shirts, and neckties and reported to the royal corporate court and wasted days trying to bring them up to date on what was happening in California. Fairchild was rather enlightened, for an eastern corporation, but the truth was, there was no one back east who understood how to run a corporation in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. Back east they had never progressed beyond the year 1940. Consequently, they were still hobbled by all of the primitive stupidities of bureaucratism and labor-management battles. They didn’t have the foggiest comprehension of the Silicon Valley idea of a corporate community. The brightest young businessmen in the East were trained—most notably at the Harvard Business School—to be little Machiavellian princes. Greed and strategy were all that mattered. They were trained for failure. Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the three original eight Shockley elves still at Fairchild, decided to form their own company. They went to Arthur Rock, who had helped provide the start-up money for Fairchild Semiconductors when he was at Hayden Stone. Now Rock had his own venture capital operation. Noyce took great pleasure in going through none of the steps in corporate formation that the business schools talked about. He and Moore didn’t even write up a proposal. They merely told Rock what they wanted to do and put up $500,000 of their own money, $250,000 each. That seemed to impress Rock more than anything they could possibly have written down, and he rounded up $2.5 million of the start-up money. A few months later another $300,000 came, this time from Grinnell College. Noyce had been on the college’s board of trustees since 1962, and a board member had asked him to give the college a chance to invest, should the day come when he started his own company. So Grinnell College became one of the gamblers betting on Noyce and Intel—the pseudotech engineerologism Noyce and Moore dreamed up as the corporate name. Josiah Grinnell would have loved it. The defection of Noyce and Moore from Fairchild was an earthquake even within an industry jaded by the very subject of defections. In the Silicon Valley everybody had looked upon Fairchild as Noyce’s company. He was the magnet that held the place together. With Noyce gone, it was obvious that the entire work force would be up for grabs. As one wag put it, “People were practically driving trucks over to Fairchild Semiconductor and loading up with employees.” Fairchild responded by pulling off one of the grossest raids in corporate history. One day the troops who were left at Fairchild looked across their partitions and saw a platoon of young men with terrific suntans moving into the executive office cubicles. They would always remember what terrific suntans they had. They were C. Lester Hogan, chief executive officer of the Motorola semiconductor division in Phoenix, and his top echelon of engineers and administrators. Or, rather, C. Lester Hogan of Motorola until yesterday. Fairchild had hired the whole bunch away from Motorola and installed them in place of Noyce & Co. like a matched set. There was plenty of sunshine in the Santa Clara Valley, but nobody here had suntans like this bunch from Phoenix. Fairchild had lured the leader of the young sun-gods out of the Arizona desert in the most direct way imaginable. He had offered him an absolute fortune in money and stock. Hogan received so much, the crowd at the Wagon Wheel said, that henceforth wealth in the Silicon Valley would be measured in units called hogans.* Noyce and Moore, meanwhile, started up Intel in a tilt-up concrete building that Jean Hoerni and his group had built, but no longer used, in Santa Clara, which was near Mountain View. Once again there was an echo of Shockley. They opened up shop with a dozen bright young electrical engineers, plus a few clerical and maintenance people, and bet everything on research and product development. Noyce and Moore, like Shockley, put on the white coats and worked at the laboratory tables. They would not be competing with Fairchild or anyone else in the already established semiconductor markets. They had decided to move into the most backward of computer technology, which was data storage, or “memory.” A computer’s memory was stored in ceramic ringlets known as cores. Each ringlet contained one “bit” of information, a “yes” or a “no,” in the logic of the binary system of mathematics that computers employ. Within two years Noyce and Moore had developed the 1103 memory chip, a chip of silicon and polysilicon the size of two letters in a line of type. Each chip contained four thousand transistors, did the work of a thousand ceramic ringlets, and did it faster. The production line still consisted of rows of women sitting at tables as in the old shed-and-rafter days, but the work bays now looked like something from out of an inter-galactic adventure movie. The women engraved the circuits on the silicon photographically, wearing antiseptic Mars Voyage suits, headgear, and gloves because a single speck of dust could ruin one of the miniature circuits. The circuits were so small that “miniature” no longer sounded small enough. The new word was “microminiature.” Everything now took place in an air-conditioned ice cube of vinyl tiles, stainless steel, fluorescent lighting, and backlit plastic. The 1103 memory chip opened up such a lucrative field that other companies, including Fairchild, fought desperately just to occupy the number-two position, filling the orders Intel couldn’t take care of. At the end of Intel’s first year in business, which had been devoted almost exclusively to research, sales totaled less than three thousand dollars and the work force numbered forty-two. In 1972, thanks largely to the 1103 chip, sales were $23.4 million and the work force numbered 1,002. In the next year sales almost tripled, to $66 million, and the work force increased two and a half times, to 2,528. So Noyce had the chance to run a new company from start-up to full production precisely the way he thought Shockley should have run his in Palo Alto back in the late 1950s. From the beginning Noyce gave all the engineers and most of the office workers stock options. He had learned at Fairchild that in a business so dependent upon research, stock options were a more powerful incentive than profit sharing. People sharing profits naturally wanted to concentrate on products that were already profitable rather than plunge into avant-garde research that would not pay off in the short run even if it were successful. But people with stock options lived for research breakthroughs. The news would send a semiconductor company’s stock up immediately, regardless of profits. Noyce’s idea was that every employee should feel that he could go as far and as fast in this industry as his talent would take him. He didn’t want any employee to look at the structure of Intel and see a complex set of hurdles. It went without saying that there would be no social hierarchy at Intel, no executive suites, no pinstripe set, no reserved parking places, or other symbols of the hierarchy. But Noyce wanted to go further. He had never liked the business of the office cubicles at Fairchild. As miserable as they were, the mere possession of one symbolized superior rank. At Intel executives would not be walled off in offices. Everybody would be in one big room. There would be nothing but low partitions to separate Noyce or anyone else from the lowliest stock boys trundling in the accordion printout paper. The whole place became like a shed. When they first moved into the building, Noyce worked at an old, scratched, secondhand metal desk. As the company expanded, Noyce kept the same desk, and new stenographers, just hired, were given desks that were not only newer but bigger and better than his. Everybody noticed the old beat-up desk, since there was nothing to keep anybody from looking at every inch of Noyce’s office space. Noyce enjoyed this subversion of the eastern corporate protocol of small metal desks for underlings and large wooden desks for overlords. At Intel, Noyce decided to eliminate the notion of levels of management altogether. He and Moore ran the show; that much was clear. But below them there were only the strategic business segments, as they called them. They were comparable to the major departments in an orthodox corporation, but they had far more autonomy. Each was run like a separate corporation. Middle managers at Intel had more responsibility than most vice-presidents back east. They were also much younger and got lower-back pain and migraines earlier. At Intel, if the marketing division had to make a major decision that would affect the engineering division, the problem was not routed up a hierarchy to a layer of executives who oversaw both departments. Instead, “councils,” made up of people already working on the line in the divisions that were affected, would meet and work it out themselves. The councils moved horizontally, from problem to problem. They had no vested power. They were not governing bodies but coordinating councils. Noyce was a great believer in meetings. The people in each department or work unit were encouraged to convene meetings whenever the spirit moved them. There were rooms set aside for meetings at Intel, and they were available on a first come, first served basis, just like the parking spaces. Often meetings were held at lunchtime. That was not a policy; it was merely an example set by Noyce. There were no executive lunches at Intel. Back east, in New York, executives treated lunch as a daily feast of the nobility, a sumptuous celebration of their eminence, in the Lucullan expense-account restaurants of Manhattan. The restaurants in the East and West Fifties of Manhattan were like something from out of a dream. They recruited chefs from all over Europe and the Orient. Pasta primavera, saucisson, sorrel mousse, homard cardinal, terrine de légumes Montesquiou, paillard de pigeon, medallions of beef Chinese Gordon, veal Valdostana, Verbena roast turkey with Hayman sweet potatoes flown in from the eastern shore of Virginia, raspberry soufflé, baked Alaska, zabaglione, pear torte, crème brulée—and the wines! and the brandies! and the port! the Sambuca! the cigars! and the decor!—walls with lacquered woodwork and winking mirrors and sconces with little pleated peach-colored shades, all of it designed by the very same decorators who walked duchesses to parties for Halston on Eaton Square!—and captains and maître d’s who made a fuss over you in movie French in front of your clients and friends and fellow overlords!—it was Mount Olympus in mid-Manhattan every day from twelve-thirty to three p.m., and you emerged into the pearl-gray light of the city with such ambrosia pumping through your veins that even the clotted streets with the garbagemen backing up their grinder trucks and yelling, “’Mon back, ’mon back, ’mon back, ’mon back,” as if talking Urban Chippewa—even this became part of the bliss of one’s eminence in the corporate world! There were many chief executive officers who kept their headquarters in New York long after the last rational reason for doing so had vanished ... because of the ineffable experience of being a CEO and having lunch five days a week in Manhattan! At Intel lunch had a different look to it. You could tell when it was noon at Intel, because at noon men in white aprons arrived at the front entrance gasping from the weight of the trays they were carrying. The trays were loaded down with deli sandwiches and waxed cups full of drinks with clear plastic tops, with globules of Sprite or Diet Shasta sliding around the tops on the inside. That was your lunch. You ate some sandwiches made of roast beef or chicken sliced into translucent rectangles by a machine in a processing plant and then reassembled on the bread in layers that gave off dank whiffs of hormones and chemicals, and you washed it down with Sprite or Diet Shasta, and you sat amid the particle-board partitions and metal desktops, and you kept your mind on your committee meeting. That was what Noyce did, and that was what everybody else did. If Noyce called a meeting, then he set the agenda. But after that, everybody was an equal. If you were a young engineer and you had an idea you wanted to get across, you were supposed to speak up and challenge Noyce or anybody else who didn’t get it right away. This was a little bit of heaven. You were face to face with the inventor, or the co-inventor, of the very road to El Dorado, and he was only forty-one years old, and he was listening to you. He had his head down and his eyes beamed up at you, and he was absorbing it all. He wasn’t a boss. He was Gary Cooper! He was here to help you be self-reliant and do as much as you could on your own. This wasn’t a corporation ... it was a congregation. By the same token, there were sermons and homilies. At Intel everyone—Noyce included—was expected to attend sessions on “the Intel Culture.” At these sessions the principles by which the company was run were spelled out and discussed. Some of the discussions had to do specifically with matters of marketing or production. Others had to do with the broadest philosophical principles of Intel and were explained via the Socratic method at management seminars by Intel’s number-three man, Andrew Grove. Grove would say, “How would you sum up the Intel approach?” Many hands would go up, and Grove would choose one, and the eager communicant would say: “At Intel you don’t wait for someone else to do it. You take the ball yourself and you run with it.” And Grove would say, “Wrong. At Intel you take the ball yourself and you let the air out and you fold the ball up and put it in your pocket. Then you take another ball and run with it and when you’ve crossed the goal you take the second ball out of your pocket and reinflate it and score twelve points instead of six.” Grove was the most colorful person at Intel. He was a thin man in his mid-thirties with tight black curls all over his head. The curls ran down into a pair of muttonchops that seemed to run together like goulash with his moustache. Every day he wore either a turtleneck jersey or an open shirt with an ornamental chain twinkling on his chest. He struck outsiders as the epitome of a style of the early 1970s known as California Groovy. In fact, Grove was the epitome of the religious principle that the greater the freedom—for example, the freedom to dress as you pleased—the greater the obligation to exercise discipline. Grove’s own groovy outfits were neat and clean. The truth was, he was a bit of a bear on the subject of neatness and cleanliness. He held what he called “Mr. Clean inspections,” showing up in various work areas wearing his muttonchops and handlebar moustache and his Harry Belafonte cane cutter’s shirt and the gleaming chainwork, inspecting offices for books stacked too high, papers strewn over desktops, everything short of running a white glove over the shelves, as if this were some California Groovy Communal version of Parris Island, while the chain twinkled in his chest hairs. Grove was also the inspiration for such items as the performance ratings and the Late List. Each employee received a report card periodically with a grade based on certain presumably objective standards. The grades were superior, exceeds requirements, meets requirements, marginally meets requirements, and does not meet requirements. This was the equivalent of A, B, C, D, and F in school. Noyce was all for it. “If you’re ambitious and hardworking,” he would say, “you want to be told how you’re doing.” In Noyce’s view, most of the young hotshots who were coming to work for Intel had never had the benefit of honest grades in their lives. In the late 1960s and early 1970s college faculties had been under pressure to give all students passing marks so they wouldn’t have to go off to Vietnam, and they had caved in, until the entire grading system was meaningless. At Intel they would learn what measuring up meant. The Late List was also like something from a strict school. Everyone was expected at work at eight a.m. A record was kept of how many employees arrived after 8:10 a.m. If 7 percent or more were late for three months, then everybody in the section had to start signing in. There was no inevitable penalty for being late, however. It was up to each department head to make of the Late List what he saw fit. If he knew a man was working overtime every night on a certain project then his presence on the Late List would probably be regarded as nothing more than that, a line on a piece of paper. At bottom—and this was part of the Intel Culture—Noyce and Grove knew that penalties were very nearly useless. Things like report cards and Late Lists worked only if they stimulated self-discipline. The worst form of discipline at Intel was to be called on the Antron II carpet before Noyce himself. Noyce insisted on ethical behavior in all dealings within the company and between companies. That was the word people used to describe his approach, ethical; that and moral. Noyce was known as a very aggressive businessman, but he stopped short of cutting throats—and he never talked about revenge. He would not tolerate peccadilloes such as little personal I’ll-reimburse-it-on-Monday dips into the petty cash. Noyce’s Strong Silent stare, his Gary Cooper approach, could be mortifying as well as inspiring. When he was angry, his baritone voice never rose. He seemed like a powerful creature that only through the greatest self-control was refraining from an attack. He somehow created the impression that if pushed one more inch, he would fight. As a consequence he seldom had to. No one ever trifled with Bob Noyce. Noyce managed to create an ethical universe within an inherently amoral setting: the American business corporation in the second half of the twentieth century. At Intel there was good and there was evil, and there was freedom and there was discipline, and to an extraordinary degree employees internalized these matters, as if members of Cromwell’s army. As the work force grew at Intel, and the profits soared, labor unions, chiefly the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Teamsters, and the Stationary Engineers Union, made several attempts to organize Intel. Noyce made known, albeit quietly, that he regarded unionization as a death threat to Intel, and to the semiconductor industry generally. Labor-management battles were part of the ancient terrain of the East. If Intel were divided into workers and bosses, with the implication that each side had to squeeze its money out of the hides of the other, the enterprise would be finished. Motivation would no longer be internal; it would be objectified in the deadly form of work rules and grievance procedures. The one time it came down to a vote, the union lost by the considerable margin of four to one. Intel’s employees agreed with Noyce. Unions were part of the dead hand of the past.... Noyce and Intel were on the road to El Dorado. By the early 1970s Noyce and Moore’s 1103 memory chip had given this brand-new company an entire corner of the semiconductor market. But that was only the start. Now a thirty-two-year-old Intel engineer named Ted Hoff came up with an invention as important as Noyce’s integrated circuit had been a decade earlier: the microprocessor. The microprocessor was known as “the computer on a chip,” because it put all the arithmetic and logic functions of a computer on a chip the size of the head of a tack. The possibilities for creating and using small computers now surpassed most people’s imagining, even within the industry. One of the more obvious possibilities was placing a small computer in the steering and braking mechanisms of a car that would take over for the driver in case of a skid or excessive speed on a curve. In Ted Hoff, Noyce was looking at proof enough of his hypothesis that out here on the electrical frontier the great flashes came to the young. Hoff was about the same age Noyce had been when he invented his integrated circuit. The glory was now Hoff’s. But Noyce took Hoff’s triumph as proof of a second hypothesis. If you created the right type of corporate community, the right type of autonomous congregation, genius would flower. Certainly the corporate numbers were flowering. The news of the microprocessor, on top of the success of the 1103 memory chip, nearly trebled the value of Intel stock from 1971 to 1973. Noyce’s own holdings were worth $18.5 million. He was in roughly the same position as Josiah Grinnell a hundred years before, when Grinnell brought Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. NOYCE CONTINUED TO live in the house in Los Altos hills that he had bought in 1960. He was not reluctant to spend his money; he was merely reluctant to show it. He spent a fortune on landscaping, but you could do that and the world would be none the wiser. Gradually the house disappeared from view behind an enormous wall of trees, tropical bushes, and cockatoo flowers. Noyce had a pond created on the back lawn, a waterscape elaborate enough to put on a bus tour, but nobody other than guests ever saw it. The lawn stretched on for several acres and had a tennis court, a swimming pool, and more walls of boughs and hot-pastel blossoms, and the world saw none of that, either. Noyce drove a Porsche roadster, and he didn’t mind letting it out for a romp. Back east, when men made a great deal of money, they tended to put a higher and higher value on their own hides. Noyce, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy finding new ways to hang his out over the edge. He took up paragliding over the ski slopes at Aspen on a Rogolla wing. He built a Quicksilver hang glider and flew it off cliffs until a friend of his, a champion at the sport, fractured his pelvis and a leg flying a Quicksilver. He also took up scuba diving, and now he had his Porsche. The high-performance foreign sports car became one of the signatures of the successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The sports car was perfect. Its richness consisted of something small, dense, and hidden: the engineering beneath the body shell. Not only that, the very luxury of a sports car was the experience of driving it yourself. A sports car didn’t even suggest a life with servants. Porsches and Ferraris became the favorites. By 1975 the Ferrari agency in Los Gatos was the second biggest Ferrari agency on the West Coast. Noyce also bought a 1947 Republic Seabee amphibious airplane, so that he could take the family for weekends on the lakes in northern California. He now had two aircraft, but he flew the ships himself. Noyce was among the richest individuals on the San Francisco Peninsula, as well as the most important figure in the Silicon Valley, but his name seldom appeared in the San Francisco newspapers. When it did, it was in the business section, not on the society page. That, too, became the pattern for the new rich of the Silicon Valley. San Francisco was barely forty-five minutes up the Bayshore Freeway from Los Altos, but psychologically San Francisco was an entire continent away. It was a city whose luminaries kept looking back east, to New York, to see if they were doing things correctly. In 1974 Noyce wound up in a situation that to some seemed an all-too-typical Mid-life in the Silicon Valley story. He and Betty, his wife of twenty-one years, were divorced, and the following year he “intra-married.” Noyce, who was forty-seven, married Intel’s personnel director, Ann Bowers, who was thirty-seven. The divorce was mentioned in the San Francisco Chronicle, but not as a social note. It was a major business story. Under California law, Betty received half the family’s assets. When word got out that she was going to sell off $6 million of her Intel stock in the interest of diversifying her fortune, it threw the entire market in Intel stock into a temporary spin. Betty left California and went to live in a village on the coast of Maine. Noyce kept the house in Los Altos. By this time, the mid-1970s, the Silicon Valley had become the late-twentieth-century-California version of a new city, and Noyce and other entrepreneurs began to indulge in some introspection. For ten years, thanks to racial hostilities and the leftist politics of the antiwar movement, the national press had dwelled on the subject of ethnic backgrounds. This in itself tended to make the engineers and entrepreneurs of the Silicon Valley conscious of how similar most of them were. Most of the major figures, like Noyce himself, had grown up and gone to college in small towns in the Middle West and the West. John Bardeen had grown up in and gone to college in Madison, Wisconsin. Walter Brattain had grown up in and gone to college in Washington. Shockley grew up in Palo Alto at a time when it was a small college town and went to the California Institute of Technology. Jack Kilby was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and went to college at the University of Illinois. William Hewlett was born in Ann Arbor and went to school at Stanford. David Packard grew up in Pueblo, Colorado, and went to Stanford. Oliver Buckley grew up in Sloane, Iowa, and went to college at Grinnell. Lee De Forest came from Council Bluffs, Iowa (and went to Yale). And Thomas Edison grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, and didn’t go to college at all. Some of them, such as Noyce and Shockley, had gone east to graduate school at MIT, since it was the most prestigious engineering school in the United States. But MIT had proved to be a backwater ... the sticks ... when it came to the most advanced form of engineering, solid-state electronics. Grinnell College, with its one thousand students, had been years ahead of MIT. The picture had been the same on the other great frontier of technology in the second half of the twentieth century, namely, the space program. The engineers who fulfilled one of man’s most ancient dreams, that of traveling to the moon, came from the same background, the small towns of the Midwest and the West. After the triumph of Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first mortals to walk on the moon, NASA’s administrator, Tom Paine, happened to remark in conversation: “This was the triumph of the squares.” A reporter overheard him—and did the press ever have a time with that! But Paine had come up with a penetrating insight. As it says in the Book of Matthew, the last shall be first. It was engineers from the supposedly backward and narrow-minded boondocks who had provided not only the genius but also the passion and the daring that won the space race and carried out John F. Kennedy’s exhortation, back in 1961, to put a man on the moon “before this decade is out.” The passion and the daring of these engineers was as remarkable as their talent. Time after time they had to shake off the meddling hands of timid souls from back east. The contribution of MIT to Project Mercury was minus one. The minus one was Jerome Wiesner of the MIT electronic research lab, who was brought in by Kennedy as a special adviser to straighten out the space program when it seemed to be faltering early in 1961. Wiesner kept flinching when he saw what NASA’s boondockers were preparing to do. He tried to persuade Kennedy to forfeit the manned space race to the Soviets and concentrate instead on unmanned scientific missions. The boondockers of Project Mercury, starting with the project’s director, Bob Gilruth, an aeronautical engineer from Nashwauk, Minnesota, dodged Wiesner for months, like moonshiners evading a roadblock, until they got astronaut Alan Shepard launched on the first Mercury mission. Who had time to waste on players as behind the times as Jerome Wiesner and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ... out here on technology’s leading edge? Just why was it that small-town boys from the Middle West dominated the engineering frontiers? Noyce concluded it was because in a small town you became a technician, a tinker, an engineer, and an inventor, by necessity. “In a small town,” Noyce liked to say, “when something breaks down, you don’t wait around for a new part, because it’s not coming. You make it yourself.” Yet in Grinnell necessity had been the least of the mothers of invention. There had been something else about Grinnell, something people Noyce’s age could feel but couldn’t name. It had to do with the fact that Grinnell had once been a religious community; not merely a town with a church but a town that was inseparable from the church. In Josiah Grinnell’s day most of the townspeople were devout Congregationalists, and the rest were smart enough to act as if they were. Anyone in Grinnell who aspired to the status of feed-store clerk or better joined the First Congregational Church. By the end of the Second World War educated people in Grinnell, and in all the Grinnells of the Middle West, had begun to drop this side of their history into a lake of amnesia. They gave in to the modem urge to be urbane. They themselves began to enjoy sniggering over Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis’s Main Street, and Grant Wood’s American Gothic. Once the amnesia set in, all they remembered from the old days were the austere moral codes, which in some cases still hung on. Josiah Grinnell’s real estate covenants prohibiting drinking, for example.... Just imagine! How absurd it was to see these unburied bones of something that had once been strong and alive. That something was Dissenting Protestantism itself. Oh, it had once been quite strong and very much alive! The passion—the exhilaration!—of those early days was what no one could any longer recall. To be a believing Protestant in a town such as Grinnell in the middle of the nineteenth century was to experience a spiritual ecstasy greater than any that the readers of Main Street or the viewers of American Gothic were likely to know in their lifetimes. Josiah Grinnell had gone to Iowa in 1854 to create nothing less than a City of Light. He was a New Englander who had given up on the East. He had founded the first Congregational church in Washington, D.C., and then defected from it when the congregation, mostly southerners, objected to his antislavery views. He went to New York and met the famous editor of the New York Herald, Horace Greeley. It was while talking to Josiah Grinnell, who was then thirty-two and wondering what to do with his life, that Greeley uttered the words for which he would be remembered forever after: “Go west, young man, go west.” So Grinnell went to Iowa, and he and three friends bought up five thousand acres of land in order to start up a Congregational community the way he thought it should be done. A City of Light! The first thing he organized was the congregation. The second was the college. Oxford and Cambridge had started banning Dissenting Protestants in the seventeenth century; Dissenters founded their own schools and colleges. Grinnell became a champion of “free schools,” and it was largely thanks to him that Iowa had one of the first and best public-school systems in the west. To this day Iowa has the highest literacy rate of any state. In the 1940s a bright youngster whose parents were not rich—such as Bob Noyce or his brother Donald—was far more likely to receive a superior education in Iowa than in Massachusetts. And if he was extremely bright, if he seemed to have the quality known as genius, he was infinitely more likely to go into engineering in Iowa, or Illinois or Wisconsin, than anywhere in the East. Back east engineering was an unfashionable field. The East looked to Europe in matters of intellectual fashion, and in Europe the ancient aristocratic bias against manual labor lived on. Engineering was looked upon as nothing more than manual labor raised to the level of a science. There was “pure” science and there was engineering, which was merely practical. Back east engineers ranked, socially, below lawyers; doctors; Army colonels; Navy captains; English, history, biology, chemistry, and physics professors; and business executives. This piece of European snobbery had never reached Grinnell, Iowa, however. Neither had the corollary piece of snobbery that said a scientist was lowering himself by going into commerce. Dissenting Protestants looked upon themselves as secular saints, men and women of God who did God’s work not as penurious monks and nuns but as successful workers in the everyday world. To be rich and successful was even better, and just as righteous. One of Josiah Grinnell’s main projects was to bring the Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. Many in his congregation became successful farmers of the gloriously fertile soil around Grinnell. But there was no sense of rich and poor. All the congregation opened up the virgin land in a common struggle out on the frontier. They had given up the comforts of the East ... in order to create a City of Light in the name of the Lord. Every sacrifice, every privation, every denial of the pleasures of the flesh, brought them closer to that state of bliss in which the light of God shines forth from the apex of the soul. What were the momentary comforts and aristocratic poses of the East ... compared to this? Where would the fleshpots back east be on that day when the heavens opened up and a light fell ’round about them and a voice from on high said: “Why mockest thou me?” The light! The light! Who, if he had ever known that glorious light, if he had ever let his soul burst forth into that light, could ever mock these, my very seed, with a Main Street or an American Gothic! There, in Grinnell, reigned the passion that enabled men and women to settle the West in the nineteenth century against the most astonishing odds and in the face of overbearing hardships. By the standards of St. Francis of Assisi or St. Jerome, who possessed nothing beyond the cloak of righteousness, Josiah Grinnell was a very secular saint, indeed. And Robert Noyce’s life was a great deal more secular than Josiah Grinnell’s. Noyce had wandered away from the church itself. He smoked. He took a drink when he felt like it. He had gotten a divorce. Nevertheless, when Noyce went west, he brought Grinnell with him ... unaccountably sewn into the lining of his coat! In the last stage of his career Josiah Grinnell had turned from the building of his community to broader matters affecting Iowa and the Middle West. In 1863 he became one of midland Iowa’s representatives in Congress. Likewise, in 1974 Noyce turned over the actual running of Intel to Gordon Moore and Andrew Grove and kicked himself upstairs to become chairman of the board. His major role became that of spokesman for the Silicon Valley and the electronic frontier itself. He became chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He led the industry’s campaign to deal with the mounting competition from Japan. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in a White House ceremony in 1980. He was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents in 1982 and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in February 1983. By now Intel’s sales had grown from $64 million in 1973 to almost a billion a year. Noyce’s own fortune was incalculable. (Grinnell College’s $300,000 investment had multiplied in value more than thirty times, despite some sell-offs, almost doubling the college’s endowment.) Noyce was hardly a famous man in the usual sense, however. He was practically unknown to the general public. But among those who followed the semiconductor industry he was a legend. He was certainly famous back east on Wall Street. When a reporter asked James Magid of the underwriting firm of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin about Noyce, he said: “Noyce is a national treasure.” Oh yes! What a treasure, indeed, was the moral capital of the nineteenth century! Noyce happened to grow up in a family in which the long-forgotten light of Dissenting Protestantism still burned brightly. The light!—the light at the apex of every human soul! Ironically, it was that long-forgotten light ... from out of the churchy, blue-nosed sticks ... that led the world into the twenty-first century, across the electronic grid and into space. Surely the moral capital of the nineteenth century is by now all but completely spent. Robert Noyce turns fifty-six this month, and his is the last generation to have grown up in families where the light existed in anything approaching a pure state. And yet out in the Silicon Valley some sort of light shines still. People who run even the newest companies in the Valley repeat Noycisms with conviction and with relish. The young CEOs all say: “Datadyne is not a corporation, it’s a culture,” or “Cybernetek is not a corporation, it’s a society,” or “Honey Bear’s assets”—the latest vogue is for down-home nontech names—“Honey Bear’s assets aren’t hardware, they’re the software of the three thousand souls who work here.” They talk about the soul and spiritual vision as if it were the most natural subject in the world for a well-run company to be concerned about. On June 8, 1983, one of the Valley’s new firms, Eagle Computer, Inc., sold its stock to the public for the first time. Investors went for it like the answer to a dream. At the close of trading on the stock market, the company’s forty-year-old CEO, Dennis Barnhart, was suddenly worth nine million dollars. Four and a half hours later he and a pal took his Ferrari out for a little romp, hung their hides out over the edge, lost control on a curve in Los Gatos, and went through a guardrail, and Barnhart was killed. Naturally, that night people in the business could talk of very little else. One of the best-known CEOs in the Valley said, “It’s the dark side of the Force.” He said it without a trace of irony, and his friends nodded in contemplation. They knew exactly what Force he meant. *Dirk Hanson, The New Alchemists (Boston: Little, Brown, 1982).

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Jade Bonacolta landed five promotions at LinkedIn in less than seven years. The secret to her success? A 3-step "pre-read" email she sent her manager before each one-on-one meeting. On the agenda today: But first: A trip to San Francisco. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. I spent much of the past week in San Francisco, where I met many of my West Coast-based colleagues for the first time. What a talented team! It was especially exciting to see them in action. On Tuesday night, a bunch of us were out for drinks around the waterfront — but two people were missing. It turned out they were working on a big scoop: Mira Murati, OpenAI's former chief technology officer, was aiming to raise a $1 billion funding round at about a $9 billion valuation for her new startup, Thinking Machines Lab. "A $9 billion valuation is unusually high for a startup less than a year old, but investors have been eager to back AI startups, especially those founded by former OpenAI employees," wrote Ben Bergman and Julia Hornstein, who broke the story. It certainly got the attention of Elon Musk, who replied to an X user who wondered "How the heck is it valued at $9 billion?" That wasn't the only tech scoop we had this past week. Hugh Langley wrote about Google employees tracking the company's layoffs in a Google Doc. Meanwhile, Eugene Kim revealed Amazon is cracking down on job seekers who use AI in the interview process, which you can read more about below. We also spent some time meeting with VCs and founders. Steve Russolillo, our Chief News Editor, and I had breakfast with Sarah Guo, a Goldman Sachs and Greylock alum who started her own AI-focused VC fund, Conviction, a few years ago. Click here for a Q&A on her views on spotting AI opportunities, making it in tech, and more. The pace of change and the capital at stake in tech right now are mindblowing. Our crackerjack staff is committed to chronicling the boom and what it means for people trying to make it during this wild time. As always, please let me know what you think, at eic@businessinsider.com. At JPMorgan, Monday marks the the beginning of the end of hybrid work. It could also be the start of a standoff between some of the bank's tech workers and CEO Jamie Dimon. Following Dimon's harsh words about remote work, BI spoke with a handful of recruiters and JPMorgan employees about what's to come. While 70% of the bank's employees are back in the office five days a week, tech workers are among those still working a few days from home. Some employees told BI they are considering putting out feelers elsewhere. Others — including Nicolas Welch, who sparked Dimon's infamous town hall comments — want to stick around, under certain conditions. Is RTO a dealbreaker? For years, advanced degrees were a safety net people believed they could rely on when the job market got tough. More recently, the opposite is ringing true. The shift to remote work, skills-based hiring, and AI have altered the white-collar landscape. People with advanced degrees now face longer job searches than their less-educated peers. Some highly educated candidates are even hiding their credentials to try and increase their employment chances. Unemployment by degrees. Goldman Sachs' Dallas office has existed for decades, but it's now experiencing a massive growth spurt. What was once a back-office hub for real estate and private wealth is now the bank's second-largest US office, behind New York. Dallas' lower cost of living and open-door culture are just two of the highlights of working there, employees told BI. A suite for every Mavericks game and free entry to the Nasher Sculpture Center don't hurt, either. Wall Street heads west. Also read: When it comes to AI, Amazon is all for it — except during its job interviews. The retail giant is cracking down on job seekers using AI tools in interviews. Candidates could be disqualified from the hiring process if caught doing so, according to recent Amazon guidelines that BI obtained. The trend is sparking a debate across Silicon Valley. Some companies are open to allowing these apps in job interviews because they're already used at work. A double standard. This week's quote: "I saw it come down. I knew immediately this was really bad — this was one of those moments where things change." — A supervisor who witnessed a freelance crew member get injured on the set of MrBeast's "Beast Games" game show. More of this week's top reads: Can America's kids read? It'll be harder to know after Trump's education cuts, researchers say.

Title: Pluralistic: With Great Power Came No Responsibility (26 Feb 2025) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I traveled to Toronto to deliver the annual Ursula Franklin Lecture at the University of Toronto's Innis College: The lecture was called "With Great Power Came No Responsibility: How Enshittification Conquered the 21st Century and How We Can Overthrow It." It's the latest major speech in my series of talks on the subject, which started with last year's McLuhan Lecture in Berlin: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel And continued with a summer Defcon keynote: https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/17/hack-the-planet/#how-about-a-nice-game-of-chess This speech specifically addresses the unique opportunities for disenshittification created by Trump's rapid unscheduled midair disassembly of the international free trade system. The US used trade deals to force nearly every country in the world to adopt the IP laws that make enshittification possible, and maybe even inevitable. As Trump burns these trade deals to the ground, the rest of the world has an unprecedented opportunity to retaliate against American bullying by getting rid of these laws and producing the tools, devices and services that can protect every tech user (including Americans) from being ripped off by US Big Tech companies. I'm so grateful for the chance to give this talk. I was hosted for the day by the Centre for Culture and Technology, which was founded by Marshall McLuhan, and is housed in the coach house he used for his office. The talk itself took place in Innis College, named for Harold Innis, who is definitely the thinking person's Marshall McLuhan. What's more, I was mentored by Innis's daughter, Anne Innis Dagg, a radical, brilliant feminist biologist who pretty much invented the field of giraffology: https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/#annedagg But with all respect due to Anne and her dad, Ursula Franklin is the thinking person's Harold Innis. A brilliant scientist, activist and communicator who dedicated her life to the idea that the most important fact about a technology wasn't what it did, but who it did it for and who it did it to. Getting to work out of McLuhan's office to present a talk in Innis's theater that was named after Franklin? Swoon! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Franklin Here's the text of the talk, lightly edited: I know tonight’s talk is supposed to be about decaying tech platforms, but I want to start by talking about nurses. A January 2025 report from Groundwork Collective documents how increasingly nurses in the USA are hired through gig apps – "Uber for nurses” – so nurses never know from one day to the next whether they're going to work, or how much they'll get paid. There's something high-tech going on here with those nurses' wages. These nursing apps – a cartel of three companies, Shiftkey, Shiftmed and Carerev – can play all kinds of games with labor pricing. Before Shiftkey offers a nurse a shift, it purchases that worker's credit history from a data-broker. Specifically, it pays to find out how much credit-card debt the nurse is carrying, and whether it is overdue. The more desperate the nurse's financial straits are, the lower the wage on offer. Because the more desperate you are, the less it'll take to get get you to come and do the gruntwork of caring for the sick, the elderly, and the dying. Now, there are lots of things going on here, and they're all terrible. What's more, they are emblematic of “enshittification,” the word I coined to describe the decay of online platforms. When I first started writing about this, I focused on the external symptomology of enshittification, a three stage process: First, the platform is good to its end users, while finding a way to lock them in. Like Google, which minimized ads and maximized spending on engineering for search results, even as they bought their way to dominance, bribing every service or product with a search box to make it a Google search box. So no matter what browser you used, what mobile OS you used, what carrier you had, you would always be searching on Google by default. This got so batshit that by the early 2020s, Google was spending enough money to buy a whole-ass Twitter, every year or two, just to make sure that no one ever tried a search engine that wasn't Google. That's stage one: be good to end users, lock in end users. Stage two is when the platform starts to abuse end users to tempt in and enrich business customers. For Google, that’s advertisers and web publishers. An ever-larger fraction of a Google results page is given over to ads, which are marked with ever-subtler, ever smaller, ever grayer labels. Google uses its commercial surveillance data to target ads to us. So that's stage two: things get worse for end users and get better for business customers. But those business customers also get locked into the platform, dependent on those customers. Once businesses are getting as little as 10% of their revenue from Google, leaving Google becomes an existential risk. We talk a lot about Google's "monopoly" power, which is derived from its dominance as a seller. But Google is also a monopsony, a powerful buyer. So now you have Google acting as a monopolist to its users (stage one), and a monoposonist for its business customers (stage two) and here comes stage three: where Google claws back all the value in the platform, save a homeopathic residue calculated to keep end users locked in, and business customers locked to those end users. Google becomes enshittified. In 2019, Google had a turning point. Search had grown as much as it possibly could. More than 90% of us used Google for search, and we searched for everything. Any thought or idle question that crossed our minds, we typed into Google. How could Google grow? There were no more users left to switch to Google. We weren't going to search for more things. What could Google do? Well, thanks to internal memos published during last year's monopoly trial against Google, we know what they did. They made search worse. They reduced the system's accuracy it so you had to search twice or more to get to the answer, thus doubling the number of queries, and doubling the number of ads. Meanwhile, Google entered into a secret, illegal collusive arrangement with Facebook, codenamed Jedi Blue, to rig the ad market, fixing prices so advertisers paid more and publishers got less. And that's how we get to the enshittified Google of today, where every query serves back a blob of AI slop, over five paid results tagged with the word AD in 8-point, 10% grey on white type, which is, in turn, over ten spammy links from SEO shovelware sites filled with more AI slop. And yet, we still keep using Google, because we're locked into it. That's enshittification, from the outside. A company that's good to end users, while locking them in. Then it makes things worse for end users, to make things better for business customers, while locking them in. Then it takes all the value for itself and turns into a giant pile of shit. Enshittification, a tragedy in three acts. I started off focused on the outward signs of enshittification, but I think it's time we start thinking about what's going in inside the companies to make enshittification possible. What is the technical mechanism for enshittification? I call it twiddling. Digital businesses have infinite flexibility, bequeathed to them by the marvellously flexible digital computers they run on. That means that firms can twiddle the knobs that control the fundamental aspects of their business. Every time you interact with a firm, everything is different: prices, costs, search rankings, recommendations. Which takes me back to our nurses. This scam, where you look up the nurse's debt load and titer down the wage you offer based on it in realtime? That's twiddling. It's something you can only do with a computer. The bosses who are doing this aren't more evil than bosses of yore, they just have better tools. Note that these aren't even tech bosses. These are health-care bosses, who happen to have tech. Digitalization – weaving networked computers through a firm or a sector – enables this kind of twiddling that allows firms to shift value around, from end users to business customers, from business customers back to end users, and eventually, inevitably, to themselves. And digitalization is coming to every sector – like nursing. Which means enshittification is coming to every sector – like nursing. The legal scholar Veena Dubal coined a term to describe the twiddling that suppresses the wages of debt-burdened nurses. It's called "Algorithmic Wage Discrimination," and it follows the gig economy. The gig economy is a major locus of enshittification, and it’s the largest tear in the membrane separating the virtual world from the real world. Gig work, where your shitty boss is a shitty app, and you aren't even allowed to call yourself an employee. Uber invented this trick. Drivers who are picky about the jobs the app puts in front of them start to get higher wage offers. But if they yield to temptation and take some of those higher-waged option, then the wage starts to go down again, in random intervals, by small increments, designed to be below the threshold for human perception. Not so much boiling the frog as poaching it, until the Uber driver has gone into debt to buy a new car, and given up the side hustles that let them be picky about the rides they accepted. Then their wage goes down, and down, and down. Twiddling is a crude trick done quickly. Any task that's simple but time consuming is a prime candidate for automation, and this kind of wage-theft would be unbearably tedious, labor-intensive and expensive to perform manually. No 19th century warehouse full of guys with green eyeshades slaving over ledgers could do this. You need digitalization. Twiddling nurses' hourly wages is a perfect example of the role digitization pays in enshittification. Because this kind of thing isn't just bad for nurses – it's bad for patients, too. Do we really think that paying nurses based on how desperate they are, at a rate calculated to increase that desperation, and thus decrease the wage they are likely to work for, is going to result in nurses delivering the best care? Do you want to your catheter inserted by a nurse on food stamps, who drove an Uber until midnight the night before, and skipped breakfast this morning in order to make rent? This is why it’s so foolish to say "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product." “If you’re not paying for the product” ascribes a mystical power to advertising-driven services: the power to bypass our critical faculties by surveilling us, and data-mining the resulting dossiers to locate our mental bind-spots, and weaponize them to get us to buy anything an advertiser is selling. In this formulation, we are complicit in our own exploitation. By choosing to use "free" services, we invite our own exploitation by surveillance capitalists who have perfected a mind-control ray powered by the surveillance data we're voluntarily handing over by choosing ad-driven services. The moral is that if we only went back to paying for things, instead of unrealistically demanding that everything be free, we would restore capitalism to its functional, non-surveillant state, and companies would start treating us better, because we'd be the customers, not the products. That's why the surveillance capitalism hypothesis elevates companies like Apple as virtuous alternatives. Because Apple charges us money, rather than attention, it can focus on giving us better service, rather than exploiting us. There's a superficially plausible logic to this. After all, in 2022, Apple updated its iOS operating system, which runs on iPhones and other mobile devices, introducing a tick box that allowed you to opt out of third-party surveillance, most notably Facebook’s. 96% of Apple customers ticked that box. The other 4% were, presumably drunk, or Facebook employees, or Facebook employees who were drunk. Which makes sense, because if I worked for Facebook, I'd be drunk all the time. So on the face of it, it seems like Apple isn't treating its customers like "the product." But simultaneously with this privacy measure, Apple was secretly turning on its own surveillance system for iPhone owners, which would spy on them in exactly the way Facebook had, for exactly the same purpose: to target ads to you based on the places you'd been, the things you'd searched for, the communications you'd had, the links you'd clicked. Apple didn't ask its customers for permission to spy on them. It didn't let opt out of this spying. It didn’t even tell them about it, and when it was caught, Apple lied about it. It goes without saying that the $1000 Apple distraction rectangle in your pocket is something you paid for. The fact that you've paid for it doesn't stop Apple from treating you as the product. Apple treats its business customers – app vendors – like the product, screwing them out of 30 cents on every dollar they bring in, with mandatory payment processing fees that are 1,000% higher than the already extortionate industry norm. Apple treats its end users – people who shell out a grand for a phone – like the product, spying on them to help target ads to them. Apple treats everyone like the product. This is what's going on with our gig-app nurses: the nurses are the product. The patients are the product. The hospitals are the product. In enshittification, "the product" is anyone who can be productized. Fair and dignified treatment is not something you get as a customer loyalty perk, in exchange for parting with your money, rather than your attention. How do you get fair and dignified treatment? Well, I'm gonna get to that, but let's stay with our nurses for a while first. The nurses are the product, and they're being twiddled, because they've been conscripted into the tech industry, via the digitalization of their own industry. It's tempting to blame digitalization for this. But tech companies were not born enshittified. They spent years – decades – making pleasing products. If you're old enough to remember the launch of Google, you'll recall that, at the outset, Google was magic. You could Ask Jeeves questions for a million years, you could load up Altavista with ten trillion boolean search operators meant to screen out low-grade results, and never come up with answers as crisp, as useful, as helpful, as the ones you'd get from a few vaguely descriptive words in a Google search-bar. There's a reason we all switched to Google. Why so many of us bought iPhones. Why we joined our friends on Facebook. All of these services were born digital. They could have enshittified at any time. But they didn't – until they did. And they did it all at once. If you were a nurse, and every patient that staggered into the ER had the same dreadful symptoms, you'd call the public health department and report a suspected outbreak of a new and dangerous epidemic. Ursula Franklin held that technology's outcomes were not preordained. They are the result of deliberate choices. I like that very much, it's a very science fictional way of thinking about technology. Good science fiction isn't merely about what the technology does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. Those social factors are far more important than the mere technical specifications of a gadget. They're the difference between a system that warns you when you're about to drift out of your lane, and a system that tells your insurer that you nearly drifted out of your lane, so they can add $10 to your monthly premium. They’re the difference between a spell checker that lets you know you've made a typo, and bossware that lets your manager use the number of typos you made this quarter so he can deny your bonus. They’re the difference between an app that remembers where you parked your car, and an app that uses the location of your car as a criterion for including you in a reverse warrant for the identities of everyone in the vicinity of an anti-government protest. I believe that enshittification is caused by changes not to technology, but to the policy environment. These are changes to the rules of the game, undertaken in living memory, by named parties, who were warned at the time about the likely outcomes of their actions, who are today very rich and respected, and face no consequences or accountability for their role in ushering in the enshittocene. They venture out into polite society without ever once wondering if someone is sizing them up for a pitchfork. In other words: I think we created a crimogenic environment, a perfect breeding pool for the most pathogenic practices in our society, that have therefore multiplied, dominating decision-making in our firms and states, leading to a vast enshittening of everything. And I think there's good news there, because if enshittification isn't the result of a new kind of evil person, or the great forces of history bearing down on the moment to turn everything to shit, but rather the result of specific policy choices, then we can reverse those policies, make better ones and emerge from the enshittocene, consigning the enshitternet to the scrapheap of history, a mere transitional state between the old, good internet, and a new, good internet. I'm not going to talk about AI today, because oh my god is AI a boring, overhyped subject. But I will use a metaphor about AI, about the limited liability company, which is a kind of immortal, artificial colony organism in which human beings serve as a kind of gut flora. My colleague Charlie Stross calls corporations "slow AI.” So you've got these slow AIs whose guts are teeming with people, and the AI's imperative, the paperclip it wants to maximize, is profit. To maximize profits, you charge as much as you can, you pay your workers and suppliers as little as you can, you spend as little as possible on safety and quality. Every dollar you don't spend on suppliers, workers, quality or safety is a dollar that can go to executives and shareholders. So there's a simple model of the corporation that could maximize its profits by charging infinity dollars, while paying nothing to its workers or suppliers, and ignoring quality and safety. But that corporation wouldn't make any money, for the obvious reasons that none of us would buy what it was selling, and no one would work for it or supply it with goods. These constraints act as disciplining forces that tamp down the AI's impulse to charge infinity and pay nothing. In tech, we have four of these constraints, anti-enshittificatory sources of discipline that make products and services better, pay workers more, and keep executives’ and shareholders' wealth from growing at the expense of customers, suppliers and labor. The first of these constraints is markets. All other things being equal, a business that charges more and delivers less will lose customers to firms that are more generous about sharing value with workers, customers and suppliers. This is the bedrock of capitalist theory, and it's the ideological basis for competition law, what our American cousins call "antitrust law." The first antitrust law was 1890's Sherman Act, whose sponsor, Senator John Sherman, stumped for it from the senate floor, saying: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. Senator Sherman was reflecting the outrage of the anitmonopolist movement of the day, when proprietors of monopolistic firms assumed the role of dictators, with the power to decide who would work, who would starve, what could be sold, and what it cost. Lacking competitors, they were too big to fail, too big to jail, and too big to care. As Lily Tomlin used to put it in her spoof AT&T ads on SNL: "We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company.” So what happened to the disciplining force of competition? We killed it. Starting 40-some years ago, the Reagaonomic views of the Chicago School economists transformed antitrust. They threw out John Sherman's idea that we need to keep companies competitive to prevent the emergence of "autocrats of trade,"and installed the idea that monopolies are efficient. In other words, if Google has a 90% search market share, which it does, then we must infer that Google is the best search engine ever, and the best search engine possible. The only reason a better search engine hasn't stepped in is that Google is so skilled, so efficient, that there is no conceivable way to improve upon it. We can tell that Google is the best because it has a monopoly, and we can tell that the monopoly is good because Google is the best. So 40 years ago, the US – and its major trading partners – adopted an explicitly pro-monopoly competition policy. Now, you'll be glad to hear that this isn't what happened to Canada. The US Trade Rep didn't come here and force us to neuter our competition laws. But don't get smug! The reason that didn't happen is that it didn't have to. Because Canada had no competition law to speak of, and never has. In its entire history, the Competition Bureau has challenged three mergers, and it has halted precisely zero mergers, which is how we've ended up with a country that is beholden to the most mediocre plutocrats imaginable like the Irvings, the Westons, the Stronachs, the McCains and the Rogerses. The only reason these chinless wonders were able to conquer this country is that the Americans had been crushing their monopolists before they could conquer the US and move on to us. But 40 years ago, the rest of the world adopted the Chicago School's pro-monopoly "consumer welfare standard,” and we got…monopolies. Monopolies in pharma, beer, glass bottles, vitamin C, athletic shoes, microchips, cars, mattresses, eyeglasses, and, of course, professional wrestling. Remember: these are specific policies adopted in living memory, by named individuals, who were warned, and got rich, and never faced consequences. The economists who conceived of these policies are still around today, polishing their fake Nobel prizes, teaching at elite schools, making millions consulting for blue-chip firms. When we confront them with the wreckage their policies created, they protest their innocence, maintaining – with a straight face – that there's no way to affirmatively connect pro-monopoly policies with the rise of monopolies. It's like we used to put down rat poison and we didn't have a rat problem. Then these guys made us stop, and now rats are chewing our faces off, and they're making wide innocent eyes, saying, "How can you be sure that our anti-rat-poison policies are connected to global rat conquest? Maybe this is simply the Time of the Rat! Maybe sunspots caused rats to become more fecund than at any time in history! And if they bought the rat poison factories and shut them all down, well, so what of it? Shutting down rat poison factories after you've decided to stop putting down rat poison is an economically rational, Pareto-optimal decision." Markets don't discipline tech companies because they don't compete with rivals, they buy them. That's a quote, from Mark Zuckerberg: “It is better to buy than to compete.” Which is why Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram for a billion dollars, even though it only had 12 employees and 25m users. As he wrote in a spectacularly ill-advised middle-of-the-night email to his CFO, he had to buy Instagram, because Facebook users were leaving Facebook for Instagram. By buying Instagram, Zuck ensured that anyone who left Facebook – the platform – would still be a prisoner of Facebook – the company. Despite the fact that Zuckerberg put this confession in writing, the Obama administration let him go ahead with the merger, because every government, of every political stripe, for 40 years, adopted the posture that monopolies were efficient. Now, think about our twiddled, immiserated nurses. Hospitals are among the most consolidated sectors in the US. First, we deregulated pharma mergers, and the pharma companies gobbled each other up at the rate of naughts, and they jacked up the price of drugs. So hospitals also merged to monopoly, a defensive maneuver that let a single hospital chain corner the majority of a region or city and say to the pharma companies, "either you make your products cheaper, or you can't sell them to any of our hospitals." Of course, once this mission was accomplished, the hospitals started screwing the insurers, who staged their own incestuous orgy, buying and merging until most Americans have just three or two insurance options. This let the insurers fight back against the hospitals, but left patients and health care workers defenseless against the consolidated power of hospitals, pharma companies, pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, and other health industry cartels, duopolies and monopolies. Which is why nurses end up signing on to work for hospitals that use these ghastly apps. Remember, there's just three of these apps, replacing dozens of staffing agencies that once competed for nurses' labor. Meanwhile, on the patient side, competition has never exercised discipline. No one ever shopped around for a cheaper ambulance or a better ER while they were having a heart attack. The price that people are willing to pay to not die is “everything they have.” So you have this sector that has no business being a commercial enterprise in the first place, losing what little discipline they faced from competition, paving the way for enshittification. But I said there are four forces that discipline companies. The second one of these forces is regulation, discipline imposed by states. It’s a mistake to see market discipline and state discipline as two isolated realms. They are intimately connected. Because competition is a necessary condition for effective regulation. Let me put this in terms that even the most ideological libertarians can understand. Say you think there should be precisely one regulation that governments should enforce: honoring contracts. For the government to serve as referee in that game, it must have the power to compel the players to honor their contracts. Which means that the smallest government you can have is determined by the largest corporation you're willing to permit. So even if you're the kind of Musk-addled libertarian who can no longer open your copy of Atlas Shrugged because the pages are all stuck together, who pines for markets for human kidneys, and demands the right to sell yourself into slavery, you should still want a robust antitrust regime, so that these contracts can be enforced. When a sector cartelizes, when it collapses into oligarchy, when the internet turns into "five giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four," then it captures its regulators. After all, a sector with 100 competing companies is a rabble, at each others' throats. They can't agree on anything, especially how they're going to lobby. While a sector of five companies – or four – or three – or two – or one – is a cartel, a racket, a conspiracy in waiting. A sector that has been boiled down to a mere handful of firms can agree on a common lobbying position. What's more, they are so insulated from "wasteful competition" that they are aslosh in cash that they can mobilize to make their regulatory preferences into regulations. In other words, they can capture their regulators. “Regulatory capture" may sound abstract and complicated, so let me put it in concrete terms. In the UK, the antitrust regulator is called the Competition and Markets Authority, run – until recently – by Marcus Bokkerink. The CMA has been one of the world's most effective investigators and regulators of Big Tech fuckery. Last month, UK PM Keir Starmer fired Bokkerink and replaced him with Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon UK. Hey, Starmer, the henhouse is on the line, they want their fox back. But back to our nurses: there are plenty of examples of regulatory capture lurking in that example, but I'm going to pick the most egregious one, the fact that there are data brokers who will sell you information about the credit card debts of random Americans. This is because the US Congress hasn't passed a new consumer privacy law since 1988, when Ronald Reagan signed a law called the Video Privacy Protection Act that bans video store clerks from telling newspapers which VHS cassettes you took home. The fact that Congress hasn't updated Americans' privacy protections since Die Hard was in theaters isn't a coincidence or an oversight. It is the expensively purchased inaction of a heavily concentrated – and thus wildly profitable – privacy-invasion industry that has monetized the abuse of human rights at unimaginable scale. The coalition in favor of keeping privacy law frozen since the season finale of St Elsewhere keeps growing, because there is an unbounded set of ways to transform the systematic invasion of our human rights into cash. There's a direct line from this phenomenon to nurses whose paychecks go down when they can't pay their credit-card bills. So competition is dead, regulation is dead, and companies aren't disciplined by markets or by states. But there are four forces that discipline firms, contributing to an inhospitable environment for the reproduction of sociopathic. enshittifying monsters. So let's talk about those other two forces. The first is interoperability, the principle of two or more things working together. Like, you can put anyone's shoelaces in your shoes, anyone's gas in your gas tank, and anyone's lightbulbs in your light-socket. In the non-digital world, interop takes a lot of work, you have to agree on the direction, pitch, diameter, voltage, amperage and wattage for that light socket, or someone's gonna get their hand blown off. But in the digital world, interop is built in, because there's only one kind of computer we know how to make, the Turing-complete, universal, von Neumann machine, a computing machine capable of executing every valid program. Which means that for any enshittifying program, there's a counterenshittificatory program waiting to be run. When HP writes a program to ensure that its printers reject third-party ink, someone else can write a program to disable that checking. For gig workers, antienshittificatory apps can do yeoman duty. For example, Indonesian gig drivers formed co-ops, that commission hackers to write modifications for their dispatch apps. For example, the taxi app won't book a driver to pick someone up at a train station, unless they're right outside, but when the big trains pull in that's a nightmare scene of total, lethal chaos. So drivers have an app that lets them spoof their GPS, which lets them park up around the corner, but have the app tell their bosses that they're right out front of the station. When a fare arrives, they can zip around and pick them up, without contributing to the stationside mishegas. In the USA, a company called Para shipped an app to help Doordash drivers get paid more. You see, Doordash drivers make most of their money on tips, and the Doordash driver app hides the tip amount until you accept a job, meaning you don't know whether you're accepting a job that pays $1.50 or $11.50 with tip, until you agree to take it. So Para made an app that extracted the tip amount and showed it to drivers before they clocked on. But Doordash shut it down, because in America, apps like Para are illegal. In 1998, Bill Clinton signed a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and section 1201 of the DMCA makes is a felony to "bypass an access control for a copyrighted work," with penalties of $500k and a 5-year prison sentence for a first offense. So just the act of reverse-engineering an app like the Doordash app is a potential felony, which is why companies are so desperately horny to get you to use their apps rather than their websites. The web is open, apps are closed. The majority of web users have installed an ad blocker (which is also a privacy blocker). But no one installs an ad blocker for an app, because it's a felony to distribute that tool, because you have to reverse-engineer the app to make it. An app is just a website wrapped in enough IP so that the company that made it can send you to prison if you dare to modify it so that it serves your interests rather than theirs. Around the world, we have enacted a thicket of laws, we call “IP laws,” that make it illegal to modify services, products, and devices, so that they serve your interests, rather than the interests of the shareholders. Like I said, these laws were enacted in living memory, by people who are among us, who were warned about the obvious, eminently foreseeable consequences of their reckless plans, who did it anyway. Back in 2010, two ministers from Stephen Harper's government decided to copy-paste America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act into Canadian law. They consulted on the proposal to make it illegal to reverse engineer and modify services, products and devices, and they got an earful! 6,138 Canadians sent in negative comments on the consultation. They warned that making it illegal to bypass digital locks would interfere with repair of devices as diverse as tractors, cars, and medical equipment, from ventilators to insulin pumps. These Canadians warned that laws banning tampering with digital locks would let American tech giants corner digital markets, forcing us to buy our apps and games from American app stores, that could cream off any commission they chose to levy. They warned that these laws were a gift to monopolists who wanted to jack up the price of ink; that these copyright laws, far from serving Canadian artists would lock us to American platforms. Because every time someone in our audience bought a book, a song, a game, a video, that was locked to an American app, it could never be unlocked. So if we, the creative workers of Canada, tried to migrate to a Canadian store, our audience couldn't come with us. They couldn't move their purchases from the US app to a Canadian one. 6,138 Canadians told them this, while just 54 respondents sided with Heritage Minister James Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement. Then, James Moore gave a speech, at the International Chamber of Commerce meeting here in Toronto, where he said he would only be listening to the 54 cranks who supported his terrible ideas, on the grounds that the 6,138 people who disagreed with him were "babyish…radical extremists." So in 2012, we copied America's terrible digital locks law into the Canadian statute book, and now we live in James Moore and Tony Clement's world, where it is illegal to tamper with a digital lock. So if a company puts a digital lock on its product they can do anything behind that lock, and it's a crime to undo it. For example, if HP puts a digital lock on its printers that verifies that you're not using third party ink cartridges, or refilling an HP cartridge, it's a crime to bypass that lock and use third party ink. Which is how HP has gotten away with ratcheting the price of ink up, and up, and up. Printer ink is now the most expensive fluid that a civilian can purchase without a special permit. It's colored water that costs $10k/gallon, which means that you print out your grocery lists with liquid that costs more than the semen of a Kentucky Derby-winning stallion. That's the world we got from Clement and Moore, in living memory, after they were warned, and did it anyway. The world where farmers can't fix their tractors, where independent mechanics can't fix your car, where hospitals during the pandemic lockdowns couldn't service their failing ventilators, where every time a Canadian iPhone user buys an app from a Canadian software author, every dollar they spend takes a round trip through Apple HQ in Cupertino, California and comes back 30 cents lighter. Let me remind you this is the world where a nurse can't get a counter-app, a plug-in, for the “Uber for nurses” app they have to use to get work, that lets them coordinate with other nurses to refuse shifts until the wages on offer rise to a common level or to block surveillance of their movements and activity. Interoperability was a major disciplining force on tech firms. After all, if you make the ads on your website sufficiently obnoxious, some fraction of your users will install an ad-blocker, and you will never earn another penny from them. Because no one in the history of ad-blockers has ever uninstalled an ad-blocker. But once it's illegal to make an ad-blocker, there's no reason not to make the ads as disgusting, invasive, obnoxious as you can, to shift all the value from the end user to shareholders and executives. So we get monopolies and monopolies capture their regulators, and they can ignore the laws they don't like, and prevent laws that might interfere with their predatory conduct – like privacy laws – from being passed. They get new laws passed, laws that let them wield governmental power to prevent other companies from entering the market. So three of the four forces are neutralized: competition, regulation, and interoperability. That left just one disciplining force holding enshittification at bay: labor. Tech workers are a strange sort of workforce, because they have historically been very powerful, able to command high wages and respect, but they did it without joining unions. Union density in tech is abysmal, almost undetectable. Tech workers' power didn't come from solidarity, it came from scarcity. There weren't enough workers to fill the jobs going begging, and tech workers are unfathomnably productive. Even with the sky-high salaries tech workers commanded, every hour of labor they put in generated far more value for their employers. Faced with a tight labor market, and the ability to turn every hour of tech worker overtime into gold, tech bosses pulled out all the stops to motivate that workforce. They appealed to workers' sense of mission, convinced them they were holy warriors, ushering in a new digital age. Google promised them they would "organize the world's information and make it useful.” Facebook promised them they would “make the world more open and connected." There's a name for this tactic: the librarian Fobazi Ettarh calls it "vocational awe." That’s where an appeal to a sense of mission and pride is used to motivate workers to work for longer hours and worse pay. There are all kinds of professions that run on vocational awe: teaching, daycares and eldercare, and, of course, nursing. Techies are different from those other workers though, because they've historically been incredibly scarce, which meant that while bosses could motivate them to work on projects they believed in, for endless hours, the minute bosses ordered them to enshittify the projects they'd missed their mothers' funerals to ship on deadline these workers would tell their bosses to fuck off. If their bosses persisted in these demands, the techies would walk off the job, cross the street, and get a better job the same day. So for many years, tech workers were the fourth and final constraint, holding the line after the constraints of competition, regulation and interop slipped away. But then came the mass tech layoffs. 260,000 in 2023; 150,000 in 2024; tens of thousands this year, with Facebook planning a 5% headcount massacre while doubling its executive bonuses. Tech workers can't tell their bosses to go fuck themselves anymore, because there's ten other workers waiting to take their jobs. Now, I promised I wouldn't talk about AI, but I have to break that promise a little, just to point out that the reason tech bosses are so horny for AI Is because they think it'll let them fire tech workers and replace them with pliant chatbots who'll never tell them to fuck off. So that's where enshittification comes from: multiple changes to the environment. The fourfold collapse of competition, regulation, interoperability and worker power creates an enshittogenic environment, where the greediest, most sociopathic elements in the body corporate thrive at the expense of those elements that act as moderators of their enshittificatory impulses. We can try to cure these corporations. We can use antitrust law to break them up, fine them, force strictures upon them. But until we fix the environment, the contagion will spread to other firms. So let's talk about how we create a hostile environment for enshittifiers, so the population and importance of enshittifying agents in companies dwindles to 1990s levels. We won't get rid of these elements. So long as the profit motive is intact, there will be people whose pursuit of profit is pathological, unmoderated by shame or decency. But we can change the environment so that these don't dominate our lives. Let's talk about antitrust. After 40 years of antitrust decline, this decade has seen a massive, global resurgence of antitrust vigor, one that comes in both left- and right-wing flavors. Over the past four years, the Biden administration’s trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice and Consumer Finance Protection Bureau did more antitrust enforcement than all their predecessors for the past 40 years combined. There's certainly factions of the Trump administration that are hostile to this agenda but Trump's antitrust enforcers at the DoJ and FTC now say that they'll preserve and enforce Biden's new merger guidelines, which stop companies from buying each other up, and they've already filed suit to block a giant tech merger. Of course, last summer a judge found Google guilty of monopolization, and now they're facing a breakup, which explains why they've been so generous and friendly to the Trump administration. Meanwhile, in Canada, our toothless Competition Bureau's got fitted for a set of titanium dentures last June, when Bill C59 passed Parliament, granting sweeping new powers to our antitrust regulator. It's true that UK PM Keir Starmer just fired the head of the UK Competition and Markets Authority and replaced him with the ex-boss of Amazon UK boss.But the thing that makes that so tragic is that the UK CMA had been doing astonishingly great work under various conservative governments. In the EU, they've passed the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, and they're going after Big Tech with both barrels. Other countries around the world – Australia, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea and China (yes, China!) – have passed new antitrust laws, and launched major antitrust enforcement actions, often collaborating with each other. So you have the UK Competition and Markets Authority using its investigatory powers to research and publish a deep market study on Apple's abusive 30% app tax, and then the EU uses that report as a roadmap for fining Apple, and then banning Apple's payments monopoly under new regulations.Then South Korea and Japan trustbusters translate the EU's case and win nearly identical cases in their courts What about regulatory capture? Well, we're starting to see regulators get smarter about reining in Big Tech. For example, the EU's Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act were designed to bypass the national courts of EU member states, especially Ireland, the tax-haven where US tech companies pretend to have their EU headquarters. The thing about tax havens is that they always turn into crime havens, because if Apple can pretend to be Irish this week, it can pretend to be Maltese or Cypriot or Luxembourgeois next week. So Ireland has to let US Big Tech companies ignore EU privacy laws and other regulations, or it'll lose them to sleazier, more biddable competitor nations. So from now on, EU tech regulation is getting enforced in the EU's federal courts, not in national courts, treating the captured Irish courts as damage and routing around them. Canada needs to strengthen its own tech regulation enforcement, unwinding monopolistic mergers from the likes of Bell and Rogers, but most of all, Canada needs to pursue an interoperability agenda. Last year, Canada passed two very exciting bills: Bill C244, a national Right to Repair law; and Bill C294, an interoperability law. Nominally, both of these laws allow Canadians to fix everything from tractors to insulin pumps, and to modify the software in their devices from games consoles to printers, so they will work with third party app stores, consumables and add-ons. However, these bills are essentially useless, because these bills don’t permit Canadians to acquire tools to break digital locks. So you can modify your printer to accept third party ink, or interpret a car's diagnostic codes so any mechanic can fix it, but only if there isn't a digital lock stopping you from doing so, because giving someone a tool to break a digital lock remains illegal thanks to the law that James Moore and Tony Clement shoved down the nation's throat in 2012. And every single printer, smart speaker, car, tractor, appliance, medical implant and hospital medical device has a digital lock that stops you from fixing it, modifying it, or using third party parts, software, or consumables in it. Which means that these two landmark laws on repair and interop are useless. So why not get rid of the 2012 law that bans breaking digital locks? Because these laws are part of our trade agreement with the USA. This is a law needed to maintain tariff-free access to US markets. I don’t know if you've heard, but Donald Trump is going to impose a 25%, across-the-board tariff against Canadian exports. Trudeau's response is to impose retaliatory tariffs, which will make every American product that Canadians buy 25% more expensive. This is a very weird way to punish America! You know what would be better? Abolish the Canadian laws that protect US Big Tech companies from Canadian competition. Make it legal to reverse-engineer, jailbreak and modify American technology products and services. Don't ask Facebook to pay a link tax to Canadian newspapers, make it legal to jailbreak all of Meta's apps and block all the ads in them, so Mark Zuckerberg doesn't make a dime off of us. Make it legal for Canadian mechanics to jailbreak your Tesla and unlock every subscription feature, like autopilot and full access to your battery, for one price, forever. So you get more out of your car, and when you sell it, then next owner continues to enjoy those features, meaning they'll pay more for your used car. That's how you hurt Elon Musk: not by being performatively appalled at his Nazi salutes. That doesn't cost him a dime. He loves the attention. No! Strike at the rent-extracting, insanely high-margin aftermarket subscriptions he relies on for his Swastikar business. Kick that guy right in the dongle! Let Canadians stand up a Canadian app store for Apple devices, one that charges 3% to process transactions, not 30%. Then, every Canadian news outlet that sells subscriptions through an app, and every Canadian software author, musician and writer who sells through a mobile platform gets a 25% increase in revenues overnight, without signing up a single new customer. But we can sign up new customers, by selling jailbreaking software and access to Canadian app stores, for every mobile device and games console to everyone in the world, and by pitching every games publisher and app maker on selling in the Canadian app store to customers anywhere without paying a 30% vig to American big tech companies. We could sell every mechanic in the world a $100/month subscription to a universal diagnostic tool. Every farmer in the world could buy a kit that would let them fix their own John Deere tractors without paying a $200 callout charge for a Deere technician who inspects the repair the farmer is expected to perform. They'd beat a path to our door. Canada could become a tech export powerhouse, while making everything cheaper for Canadian tech users, while making everything more profitable for anyone who sells media or software in an online store. And – this is the best part – it’s a frontal assault on the largest, most profitable US companies, the companies that are single-handedly keeping the S&P 500 in the black, striking directly at their most profitable lines of business, taking the revenues from those ripoff scams from hundreds of billions to zero, overnight, globally. We don't have to stop at exporting reasonably priced pharmaceuticals to Americans! We could export the extremely lucrative tools of technological liberation to our American friends, too. That's how you win a trade-war. What about workers? Here we have good news and bad news. The good news is that public approval for unions is at a high mark last seen in the early 1970s, and more workers want to join a union than at any time in generations, and unions themselves are sitting on record-breaking cash reserves they could be using to organize those workers. But here's the bad news. The unions spent the Biden years, when they had the most favorable regulatory environment since the Carter administration, when public support for unions was at an all-time high, when more workers than ever wanted to join a union, when they had more money than ever to spend on unionizing those workers, doing fuck all. They allocated mere pittances to union organizing efforts with the result that we finished the Biden years with fewer unionized workers than we started them with. Then we got Trump, who illegally fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the NLRB without a quorum and thus unable to act on unfair labor practices or to certify union elections. This is terrible. But it’s not game over. Trump fired the referees, and he thinks that this means the game has ended. But here's the thing: firing the referee doesn't end the game, it just means we're throwing out the rules. Trump thinks that labor law creates unions, but he's wrong. Unions are why we have labor law. Long before unions were legal, we had unions, who fought goons and ginks and company finks in` pitched battles in the streets. That illegal solidarity resulted in the passage of labor law, which legalized unions. Labor law is passed because workers build power through solidarity. Law doesn't create that solidarity, it merely gives it a formal basis in law. Strip away that formal basis, and the worker power remains. Worker power is the answer to vocational awe. After all, it's good for you and your fellow workers to feel a sense of mission about your jobs. If you feel that sense of mission, if you feel the duty to protect your users, your patients, your patrons, your students, a union lets you fulfill that duty. We saw that in 2023 when Doug Ford promised to destroy the power of Ontario's public workers. Workers across the province rose up, promising a general strike, and Doug Ford folded like one of his cheap suits. Workers kicked the shit out of him, and we'll do it again. Promises made, promises kept. The unscheduled midair disassembly of American labor law means that workers can have each others' backs again. Tech workers need other workers' help, because tech workers aren't scarce anymore, not after a half-million layoffs. Which means tech bosses aren't afraid of them anymore. We know how tech bosses treat workers they aren't afraid of. Look at Jeff Bezos: the workers in his warehouses are injured on the job at 3 times the national rate, his delivery drivers have to pee in bottles, and they are monitored by AI cameras that snitch on them if their eyeballs aren't in the proscribed orientation or if their mouth is open too often while they drive, because policy forbids singing along to the radio. By contrast, Amazon coders get to show up for work with pink mohawks, facial piercings, and black t-shirts that say things their bosses don't understand. They get to pee whenever they want. Jeff Bezos isn't sentimental about tech workers, nor does he harbor a particularized hatred of warehouse workers and delivery drivers. He treats his workers as terribly as he can get away with. That means that the pee bottles are coming for the coders, too. It's not just Amazon, of course. Take Apple. Tim Cook was elevated to CEO in 2011. Apple's board chose him to succeed founder Steve Jobs because he is the guy who figured out how to shift Apple's production to contract manufacturers in China, without skimping on quality assurance, or suffering leaks of product specifications ahead of the company's legendary showy launches. Today, Apple's products are made in a gigantic Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou nicknamed "iPhone City.” Indeed, these devices arrive in shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles in a state of pristine perfection, manufactured to the finest tolerances, and free of any PR leaks. To achieve this miraculous supply chain, all Tim Cook had to do was to make iPhone City a living hell, a place that is so horrific to work that they had to install suicide nets around the worker dorms to catch the plummeting bodies of workers who were so brutalized by Tim Cook's sweatshop that they attempted to take their own lives. Tim Cook is also not sentimentally attached to tech workers, nor is he hostile to Chinese assembly line workers. He just treats his workers as badly as he can get away with, and with mass layoffs in the tech sector he can treat his coders much, much worse How do tech workers get unions? Well, there are tech-specific organizations like Tech Solidarity and the Tech Workers Coalition. But tech workers will only get unions by having solidarity with other workers and receiving solidarity back from them. We all need to support every union. All workers need to have each other's backs. We are entering a period of omnishambolic polycrisis.The ominous rumble of climate change, authoritarianism, genocide, xenophobia and transphobia has turned into an avalanche. The perpetrators of these crimes against humanity have weaponized the internet, colonizing the 21st century's digital nervous system, using it to attack its host, threatening civilization itself. The enshitternet was purpose-built for this kind of apocalyptic co-option, organized around giant corporations who will trade a habitable planet and human rights for a three percent tax cut, who default us all into twiddle-friendly algorithmic feed, and block the interoperability that would let us escape their clutches with the backing of powerful governments whom they can call upon to "protect their IP rights." It didn't have to be this way. The enshitternet was not inevitable. It was the product of specific policy choices, made in living memory, by named individuals. No one came down off a mountain with two stone tablets, intoning Tony Clement, James Moore: Thou shalt make it a crime for Canadians to jailbreak their phones. Those guys chose enshittification, throwing away thousands of comments from Canadians who warned them what would come of it. We don't have to be eternal prisoners of the catastrophic policy blunders of mediocre Tory ministers. As the omnicrisis polyshambles unfolds around us, we have the means, motive and opportunity to craft Canadian policies that bolster our sovereignty, protect our rights, and help us to set every technology user, in every country (including the USA) free. The Trump presidency is an existential crisis but it also presents opportunities. When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla. We once had an old, good internet, whose major defect was that it required too much technical expertise to use, so all our normie friends were excluded from that wondrous playground. Web 2.0's online services had greased slides that made it easy for anyone to get online, but escaping from those Web 2.0 walled gardens meant was like climbing out of a greased pit. A new, good internet is possible, and necessary. We can build it, with all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0. A place where we can find each other, coordinate and mobilize to resist and survive climate collapse, fascism, genocide and authoritarianism. We can build that new, good internet, and we must.

Title: The top wealth-creating stocks have put $21 trillion back into shareholders' pockets — and 3 are still cheap to buy

Past performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation. But that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars — like AI players — in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years. She also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever. In this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid. The list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value. However, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company. Nonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates. Microsoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending. Its fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply. Alphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business. Even as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. UnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud. Its stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes. However, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty. Jump to

The W-2 mission carried a hypersonic re-entry capsule featuring a spectrometer from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), a heatshield with a Thermal Protection System (TPS) developed with NASA's Ames Research Center, and an expanded bioreactor to enhance pharmaceutical manufacturing in orbit. This mission follows the W-1 mission, which, after an eight-month operation in orbit, marked the world's first space manufacturing venture conducted outside the International Space Station. Following the January 14 launch of W-2, Rocket Lab maintained control of the spacecraft for six weeks, overseeing essential mission functions for Varda's 120kg capsule, including power management, communications, propulsion, and attitude control. The Pioneer spacecraft, designed and built at Rocket Lab's Spacecraft Production Complex in Long Beach, California, integrates in-house developed technologies, including propulsion systems, star trackers, reaction wheels, solar panels, flight software, radios, composite structures, and separation systems. To guide the capsule's return to Earth, Rocket Lab executed a series of precision deorbit and re-entry maneuvers. The process began with a burn to reduce the orbit's perigee to 300km from an initial 500km circular orbit. A second burn raised the apogee to 900km, positioning the spacecraft for re-entry. The final burn released the capsule from approximately 470km altitude. The final phase of the mission, including parachute deployment, touchdown, and payload recovery, was managed by Varda, which will now analyze the results for future missions. "Rocket Lab's expertise has expanded from delivering payloads to space to successfully bringing them back to Earth," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Supporting Varda's ambitious in-orbit manufacturing mission with another successful re-entry highlights our ability to enable complex space missions that fully leverage the potential of space." Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda, added, "Varda continues to lead in repeatable, reliable re-entry from orbit, and the success of the W-2 mission further cements our position. With additional re-entries planned, we look forward to advancing a robust orbital economy." The W-2 mission is the second of four Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing. The third spacecraft has been completed and shipped to Vandenberg Space Force Base for an upcoming launch.

To guide the capsule's return to Earth, Rocket Lab executed a series of precision deorbit and re-entry maneuvers. The process began with a burn to reduce the orbit's perigee to 300km from an initial 500km circular orbit. A second burn raised the apogee to 900km, positioning the spacecraft for re-entry. The final burn released the capsule from approximately 470km altitude. The final phase of the mission, including parachute deployment, touchdown, and payload recovery, was managed by Varda, which will now analyze the results for future missions. "Rocket Lab's expertise has expanded from delivering payloads to space to successfully bringing them back to Earth," said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Sir Peter Beck. "Supporting Varda's ambitious in-orbit manufacturing mission with another successful re-entry highlights our ability to enable complex space missions that fully leverage the potential of space." Wendy Shimata, Vice President of Autonomous Systems at Varda, added, "Varda continues to lead in repeatable, reliable re-entry from orbit, and the success of the W-2 mission further cements our position. With additional re-entries planned, we look forward to advancing a robust orbital economy." The W-2 mission is the second of four Rocket Lab Pioneer spacecraft ordered by Varda to support orbital processing. The third spacecraft has been completed and shipped to Vandenberg Space Force Base for an upcoming launch.

The steps in this guide have generated A$979,000 in salary, measured as the sum of the highest annual salaries friends and readers have reached after following along, where they were willing to attribute their success actions in here. If it works for you, email me so I can bump the number up. I currently run my business out of my own pocket. If I don't make sales, I lose savings, and it's as simple as that. I am all-in on creating work I love by force of arms, and I'd sooner leave the industry than be disrespected at a normal workplace again. The impetus to run that risk comes from two places. The first is that my tolerance for middle managers jerking themselves off at my expense is totally eroded, and I realized that I either had to do something about it or stop complaining. I'll happily go to an office if I think it will produce something I care about, but I will not do it because someone wants to impress a withered husk who thinks his sports car makes him attractive to young women. The second, and what this post is about, is that I am really good at getting jobs, and have friends with a very deep understanding of how the job market works. In Australia, when you apply for a job without permanent residency, you are filtered out of all applications immediately. It is the first question on all online application forms, and the reason is that companies do not want to deal with visa renewals and they have far too many candidates. This leads to a situation where any characteristic that is remotely inconvenient but not noticeably correlated with suitability for the business is grounds for rejection. It is not uncommon for immigrants to take months, sometimes over a year, to find their first job actually writing code. Despite being a non-white with no professional network in the country and an undesirable visa, I had my first paid programming engagement lined up before finalizing the move off my student visa. I had a full-time job on A$117K lined up for the same day my full work visa kicked in. I continued to dig up work whenever a contract was expiring, even landing a gig mid-COVID, and while most of these jobs left much to be desired, I believe this has more to do with the state of the industry in Australia than anything that I did. And I have only gotten better at this over the past two years, because while I despaired about the state of software in general, I never stopped thinking and experimenting about how to regain some control over how I'm treated. Almost everyone I spend time with now has walked away from a job without flinching. I've done it. I once caught up with a friend, and he said "Work is stupid, I'm going to Valencia for a year." I said, "W-what? Valencia? When? For a year?" "Yeah, a year. I'm going in two weeks." And then that glorious son of a bitch did it. Came home. Had a job waiting for him. Quit that job, got another job at more money. Quit that job, got one interstate because he felt like it at similar pay for half the work. All in a "weak" market. I get a lot of emails from people who despair about the state of the industry or who otherwise can't find jobs, and I always end up giving the same advice. I don't have the time to keep doing that. So in this post, I'm going to attempt to convince thousands of people that you should have much higher standards for what you tolerate, that you can build up the reserves to do your version of going to Valencia (this could just be staying home and playing with your kids for six months), and that it is immensely risky not to have this ability in your back pocket. Along the way, we will answer questions like "How long should a CV be?", "What should go on it?", and "When will this suffering end?" From Scott Smitelli's phenomenal The Ideal Candidate Will Be Punched In The Stomach: What was the plan here? Why did you leave a perfectly sustainable—if difficult and slightly unrewarding—job to do this crap? What even is this crap? You are, and let’s not mince words here, you are a thief. That’s the only way to make sense of this situation: You are stealing money from somebody, somehow. This is money you have not earned. There is no legitimate way that you should be receiving any form of compensation for simply absorbing abuse. These people, maybe the whole company but certainly the people in your immediate management chain, are irredeemably damaged to be using human beings that way. They will take, and take, and smile at you like they’re doing you some kind of favor, and maybe throw you a little perk from time to time to distract you from thinking about it too hard. But you? You can’t stop thinking. You can’t stop thinking. 4:44. You can’t stop thinking. If you're in this photo and don't like it, this blog post is for you. We have one end-goal. A career where you're paid well, are treated with real respect, and we will not settle for less. And I mean real respect, as in "we will not proceed on this major project without your professional blessing, and you can fire abusive clients", not "you can work from home two days a week if the boss is feeling generous". I had a brief email exchange with Erez Zukerman, the CEO of ZSA last year, and asked how their customer support is so good — it's the best customer support I've ever experienced and there's no close second. He replied: For support, the basic understanding is that support is the heart of the business. It is not an afterthought. Support is a senior position at ZSA, with judgment, power of review over features and website updates before anything is released (nothing major goes out without a green line from every member of support), the power to fire customers (!), real flexibility when it comes to the schedule, etc. There are also lots of ways to expand, like writing (Robin has been writing incredible blog posts and creating printables), recording (Tisha recorded Tisha Talks Switches which thousands of people enjoyed), and more. Anything short of that isn't real respect. Not a special parking spot. Not the ability to pick up your kids sometimes. Not a patronizing award on Teams. Most places fall short of this, and because we have all agreed to demand better for ourselves, we are going to consider all of these places as mildly abusive. A lot of office jobs seem like a slow death of the soul — better than the swift death of the body that careers like construction work offer, but that isn't a reason to stop striving. Shoddy work. Hour long stand-ups. The deadlines are somehow always urgent and must be delivered immediately, but are also always late and everyone knows they'll be late from day one. This is delightful at times — office scenes in improvised theater get funnier the straighter you play them — but many people eventually feel that something vital is missing from their work lives. I really enjoy David Whyte's The Three Marriages as an antidote to the tedious objection of "Work to live, don't live to work". It's a part of life, and while it isn't all of life, being bored and treated like a disposable cog for eight hours a day shouldn't be any part of your life. If you're happy to coast, adieu, catch you later. This a no judgement zone for the next five minutes. Here is a quick reality check. I have, by virtue of hundreds of people reaching out to me over this blog, seen the "I want to leave my bad job" story play out far more times than a typical person does in a lifetime. It always plays out in one of two ways. The first is that the person immediately and aggressively looks for new jobs. This usually goes well. If it does not go well, they can always find a new job again. When the job is pursued through "normal" mechanisms, such as cold Seek applications, these jobs almost never meet the standard I set above: great pay, great team, great interview process, and whatever office arrangement you prefer. But they've always been doing better along at least some of the four measures. The other story is much more typical, and it goes something like this: I'd love to leave, but there's something keeping me. One more year and I'll get a new title, and then I'll be so well-placed for a new job. I've heard the market is bad, so I should wait until it picks up again. I'll get a raise soon, then I'll negotiate for a new job. I'm scared of keeping up with mortgage repayments. I just need a year to finish up this project, it'll look great on my CV. My network is terrible, so I don't have the same options open to me. I think I can make a difference if I'm given a few more months. In two years, this second approach has never gone well. Never, ever, ever. Consider this real exchange, copied verbatim and redacted. May, 2024: Me: I'm a little bit concerned that the pathway above leads to delaying indefinitely (there's always going to be a risk of moving then getting laid off - so what risk level do you actually tolerate, and how is that balanced against [COMPANY] being run so badly that you can get laid off there too?) but you know your situation better than me. Reader: Well, the company was bought out and seems to be stabilizing. July, 2024: Reader: Got some fantastic news! Gonna get a raise at [COMPANY], 20%! It came as a surprise, apparently they think I earn too little so they're giving me a raise because of that. November, 2024: Reader: Wanted to let you know I got news, I'm gonna be fired next month. This happens so often that it's actually boring for me. I've had exchanges like the above often enough that I know the person is finished months before they do. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. They will either be let go, burn out and quit, or burn out and stay there as their health deteriorates. No one, at any level short of executive, has managed to have the impact that would be required for them to feel it was worth the cost. The thing that is missing, to my eyes, is some sense of confidence and self-respect. I hear lots of supposed barriers to getting a better job, but almost none of them are convincing, especially from people in the first world, so what I'm actually hearing about are psychological barriers. It takes a certain degree of confidence to know that you have worth, because a great deal of our society, whether by coincidence or design, causes people to feel like they're not desirable. If you don't have confidence, you feel trapped at the current situation, because what if you can't find something else? What if you're not good enough? This is a real risk, but guess what, life's risky! Two months ago, one of my high school classmates, one of the fittest people I know, died of an aneurysm at age 29. Think about it this way: enough people read this blog that if you are reading this sentence, you have just drawn a ticket in the "heart attack kills me by December" lottery. This isn't hypothetical, this will happen — someone reading this will die having spent a few hundred hours on spreadsheets this year, and perhaps even have time to think "I wish I had listened to Ludic, he is so smart and wise."1 And on self-respect, I will concede that you're getting the vestiges of my time spent in psychology, but why would anyone respect you if you let someone do Scrum at you for hours? No one respected me when I let people do Scrum at me, and that was my fault. "It what der street trolls make when dey is short o' cash an' ... what is it dey's short of, Brick?" The moving spoon paused. "Dey is short o' self-respec', Sergeant," he said, as one might who'd had the lesson shouted into his ear for twenty minutes. So where do we start off? Well, the first thing to do is bury the idea that you need this particular job, or that you are otherwise unworthy. And we're going to do that by getting really good at getting mediocre jobs, and we're almost always going to want to be doing day-rate contracts. We are going to do a lot of things that I do not endorse when going for a good job, like sending your CV anywhere, talking to recruiters, etc. Regular full-time jobs obtained through mass-market channels have dysfunctional social dynamics that are too complex to get into here. Patrick McKenzie writes: Many people think job searches go something like this: See ad for job on Monster.com Send in a resume. Get an interview. Get asked for salary requirements. Get offered your salary requirement plus 5%. Try to negotiate that offer, if you can bring yourself to. This is an effective strategy for job searching if you enjoy alternating bouts of being unemployed, being poorly compensated, and then treated like a disposable peon. Working jobs like the above comes at a real cost, even if you can get them at-will. I had an episode of intense burnout which resulted in a year of recovery, and I had to think very hard about how to not feel trapped in a bad situation again, even if the business fails. I do not want to attend hour-long stand-ups anymore. This section is about how to get the above jobs as effectively and painlessly as possible, but they will still not be great, and if you do them forever then I will be very disappointed in you. In any case, if one must engage with the market in this way to build confidence and a reputation, then day-rate contracts are amazing. I am heavily in favour of contracting. The day rate is much higher. You are forced to continue searching every few months, which means you are also forced to always be aware that you have options, and we will discuss how to minimize the pain of this. You will meet far more people because you will be at a new workplace every few months. Here in Australia, a weak contracting job will pay A$1K per day, which is approximately double what a permanent employee earns. I.e, for every six months of contracting, you can afford six months of unemployment, and you're still as well off as you were if you had been permanently employed over that period. Contracts are terminated more frequently, but you're also in a much better position because you've saved way more money per day worked, you've met tons more people, and your CV is always up-to-date. And you also knew it was going to expire in six months, so having it end three months early isn't a horrible shock to your planning. You are also excluded from the most mentally draining practices in a corporate environment, and afforded a higher status than regular employees. You will usually not be asked to attend pointless meetings, and instead be left free to execute on technical work, particularly if you indicate that you can manage scope independently. If someone does ask you to attend a pointless meeting, you can recite the Litany of a Thousands Dollars a Day in your head over and over as the project manager attempts to flay your mind. You know that delightful period after you've submitted a resignation and you're about to get out? That's the whole contract. A six month contract feels like handing in a resignation with six months of notice. When the CEO says "Can we put GenAI and blockchain in the product?", you can close your eyes, my God you are so happy, and whisper "Inshallah, I will not be on this train when it derails". None of these jobs will be great. This is not a good way to get jobs in the long-term. This is a boring, soulless way for someone that does not have any appreciable career capital or networking ability to generate adequate jobs on high pay. We only bother with this so that you know that if your business explodes, or the cool non-profit you find fires you, or if a new boss comes in and abuses you, you'll know deep down that you can walk right out that door and tell them to get fucked. I should note that the advice in this section was heavily contributed to by a friend who wishes to remain anonymous, but let us all send them silent thanks. Anyway, we take Sturgeon's Law very seriously on this blog. Ninety percent of everything is crap. It is with this understanding that we must proceed. There is a pathway to navigate that relies entirely on the broad understanding that: Let us begin with recruiters. Recruiters are an unfortunate reality of the industry. I still haven't worked out why they exist when a company can just post a job ad themselves, and their talent team has to filter out the candidates themselves anyway, but whatever. They're here, and I've learned enough about the world to accept that it's 50/50 on whether their existence is economically rational. In 2019, about a month into my first full-time programming job, I received a call from a recruiter. They were looking for someone with Airflow experience to work a contract with Coles, a massive Australian grocery chain. I had no idea what to really say to this, being inexperienced and hugely underconfident, so I just listened to his questions and answered them. Most of my answers were a sad: "Ah, no, sorry, I know what AWS is but I've never used it before at a real business. I know what Airflow is, but I've never..." Until finally we come across the fateful question: "And do you know Linux?" Why, yes, I do know Linux. At that stage of my career, it never even occurred to me to ponder what knowing Linux is. Do I even know my keyboard if I can't construct one from scratch? What does he mean know? How deranged would I have to be to say I know Python, without qualification, without being a core contributor? But none of that occurred to me, I just said yes. He is delighted, we get to chatting, and we quickly realize that we're both working our first jobs! He is a year younger, also nervous about his job, and is so happy to be talking to someone that just sounds like a normal person. He is soon comfortable enough to ask me a very vulnerable question: "So what is Linux?" I answer, and I've been doing nothing but teach psychologists-in-training statistics for a year, so the explanation is good. Each good explanation leads to another, until I'm fielding questions like: "What is Airflow? What is AWS?" We hang up, on good terms, and I stare at the wall for a long moment. There are people out there just like, calling around and functionally asking "Have you used FeebleGlorp for eight years?" with no internal model of what FeebleGlorp might be? That can't be right. Everyone at school told me that affairs would be very serious in the real world. Affairs are not very serious in the real world. Affairs have never been less serious. I told myself for a while that this must have been because he was so young, but no, they're actually almost all like this. I have only ever met two recruiters with intact brains2. To quote a reader with extensive HR experience who attempted to explain this dysfunction to me: While there are professionals that specialize in tech and with time develop enough depth to understand the discipline and move the needle in the right direction, for most recruiters it is not an economic advantage to do so; as the winds of the market are ever changing, recruiters are always the first ones to go into the chopping block when there are layoffs. Better to be a generalist recruiter and keep your job options open. I.e, the recruiters you are talking to probably go out of their way to avoid learning anything, because they may be recruiting in a different industry next month. This means a few things. I normally do not send CVs anywhere and decry them, but I've reversed my stance. They're a terrible way to get good jobs, but a heavily optimized CV will demolish most other candidates, who are about as unserious as the recruiters. So how do we optimize? Well, we're trying to get past recruiters. On your CV, quality indicators only matter if the recruiter can understand them, and as per the above they do not understand anything. At 12:34 PM today, while writing this blog post, I got a call from a recruiter and I asked them a question for blog material. "Hey, question about my CV, would it be better if I mentioned that I'm well-regarded by Linus Torvalds?" (This is not true, we don't know each other.) And they said, "Uh, I'd leave that out, these are very busy people and need technical credentials." Recruiters are only looking for one thing. They are looking for the number of years of experience that you say you have in buzzword, and possibly that you've worked somewhere like Google — but I've never seen a Googler compete for open-market contracts, so don't feel too disadvantaged. Years of experience with buzzword is the only thing that matters. Delete everything else. Link to your GitHub profile? Goodbye, none of these people are going to read that. I've been assured that the typical talent team spends five to ten seconds per CV. I am a passionate front-end developer with a drive for — no one cares, and if you reflect on how you felt even writing that sentence, of course no one cares. You didn't care. My CV used to say things like "deployed a deep learning project in collaboration with Google engineers" and it had sections like this: Some of the most talented people I know in Australia have told me that that this would qualify me for an instant interview on their teams, but this CV does not work because the person reading your CV will not care about the craft. If someone that does care reads it, it will be after four untalented people decided it was allowed to land on their desk, and at that point they're going to interview you anyway so your CV doesn't matter. The ideal CV starts with lines like this: Five (5) years expert skills in cloud database development and integration (Databricks, Snowflake) using ETL/ELT tools (dbt and Airbyte) and deploying cloud computing with AWS (EC2, RDS) and Azure (VM) cloud platforms The rest of the CV should be more lines like that, nothing else matters. A senior talent acquisition nerd at McKenzie told me that CVs should be one page, because it shows that the candidate is concise. Their counterpart at another agency said that you need three pages or you can barely get to know the candidate. Which of them is right? Both of them had no idea what they're talking about, because both of them are just eyeballing it, coming up with post-hoc rationalizations for their behavior that ignores the real hard question of why they specialize in hiring talent in fields that they cannot describe. I now trend towards a three page CV for no reason other than it looks like I must have more experience if it won't fit on one page, and it gives me more space to put buzzwords in. And when I say buzzwords, I mean you need the room to write things like "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" because some of the people reading the CVs do not know they are the same thing. Act on the principle of minimum charity, and accept that this version of your CV will never get you a great job. We know what we're optimizing for at this stage, and it isn't amazing colleagues, it is the ability to refill your coffers very quickly and with minimal pain. Okay, but which buzzwords do you pick? If you hop onto a job search platform, you are going to see many jobs that are essentially asking you to cosplay as a software engineer. For example, I have just hopped onto Seek and punched in "data engineer", my own subspecialty. This immediately yields this job from an international consultancy whose frontpage reads: GenAI is the most powerful force in business—and society—since the steam engine. As software and code generate more value than ever, every worker, business leader, student, and parent is now asking: Are we ready? Wow, that sure is something! I think speak on behalf of all of us when I say "please stop, you're hurting us". Also it looks like there isn't a single mention of AI on their website in 2022, so I'm really impressed that they've become experts in a novel technology just in time to cash in on over-excited executives. But what does the actual job listing entail? Proficient in Azure Data Factory, Databricks, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). And from this, by mental force, I can tell you everything you need to know about the job. My third eye is fully open, and the recruiting department's pathetic attempts to ward off my psychic intrusions are but tattered veils before a hurricane. They are almost certainly recruiting data engineers for a company with a very weak IT department, probably a government client, that is in the middle of a failing cloud migration. SSIS is the phylactery of a millennia old lich-king, a piece of software that runs out of SQL Server on old government data warehouses everywhere. The first time I had to fix an SSIS production outage, the senior engineer on my team told me to "untick all the boxes on that screen, then re-tick them all and click save", and that actually solved the problem. The entire point of a cloud migration is to stop using SSIS and use something better, but that would require you to be good at your job, so instead consultancies sell Azure Data Factory. Azure Data Factory is notable for having been forged in the hottest furnace in Hell. The last time I used it, I clicked "save" on a slow internet connection and it started to open and close random panels for five minutes before saving my work, which I can only assume means that the product has to open every component on the front-end to fetch data from the DOM to populate a POST request... which is, you know, is certainly one way that we could do things. Why use something so bad? It's because Azure Data Factory can be used to run SSIS packages! So now you're on the cloud, and have a new bad service running your old bad service, all without actually improving anything! And of course, they are both tools that do not require programming, so the consultancy can sell you a team of non-programmers for $2,000 per day. I've worked alongside one of these teams. They had one good developer who desperately tried to handle all of their work at once, and I shit you not, four "engineers" that spent eight hours a day copying-and-pasting secrets out of legacy SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory's secret manager for weeks on end. With a bit of experience, most job listings are simply an honor roll of dead IT projects. And because many executives hop onto the same bandwagons at the same times (but call it innovation), there seem to be specific patterns for the type of cog that companies are pursuing at any given moment. The friend who gave me most of the tips in here has an "Azure Data Engineer" CV, where he removes all mention of AWS work he has done so that government recruiters don't hurt their pretty little heads, and vice versa. Companies on Azure want Databricks because you can spin it up from the Azure UI, and companies on AWS similarly use Snowflake because of groupthink. Just smash those words onto the page. Every field can think of some variation of this. If you're a data scientist, it'll be a few common patterns to try cram LLMs into things. If you're a front-end developer, it's probably going to be a soup of React and its supporting technologies. Again, no one reading your CV until the final stage will know anything. Once, a recruiter had coffee with me, and they asked me why Git is such a popular programming language. I write my CV in Overleaf because I can make faster edits during the early phases of figuring out which patterns work, and fidgeting with layout is probably the most annoying part of any sort of CV-writing. This is a tough situation. What I did was looking up a few "easy" jobs, like data analyst, hop onto LinkedIn, navigate to that company's page, then navigate to someone that looks like they might be leading the relevant team. Do not message HR. They, as a rule, do not have human frailties like mercy and kindness while they are at work. Go straight to someone that actually cares if you are good at the job, and impress upon them that you are a real person, who either has a very cool life story about changing career pathways late in life, or who is an adorable graduate UwU. If you are super, super, super desperate, my company has an unpaid internship for graduates that really, really, really think that they just need a tiny bit of experience to get taken seriously. Once you're done scrubbing all signs of personality or competence out of your CV, leaving only eight (8) years of experience, what then? If you're going to be doing this all the time, how do we make it relatively painless? The first thing is to hop onto a bunch of job platforms and upload the CV. That's simple enough. This means that recruiters will start reaching out to you every week or so, and some of them will have jobs for you. 90% of them will fail to secure you an interview. I start the conversations with something like "In the interest of making sure we're making good use of time, what's the expected compensation for the job?". They'll say a number. If the number isn't high enough, thank them for their time and hang up. Don't waste your time. They will not present you to the candidate if you ask them to do any work beyond sending a CV and collecting a commission — from their perspective, you are cattle to be sold. If I was desperate, I would take the first job offered to me at any pay, then not slow my search down at all. Most contracts allow you to quit on very short notice, so use that against the employer instead of having it used against you for a change. The second thing is that you can start testing out the CV in the lowest-effort manner possible. The recommendation from my friend that has experimented the most is to grab a job platform's app on your phone, and to apply to maybe three or four jobs every morning. Don't bother with ones that ask you to make accounts on new job platforms, or write cover letters, or anything like that. Save a filter that removes anything you aren't willing to do, whether it's pay that's too low or a long commute. Err on the side of being picky, and do this every workday, even if you already have a contract. If the list of jobs becomes empty, then you must either relax your constraints or move to a new area. Sorry! If you get as far as a call with a human and are later rejected, ask them, especially recruiters, what employers want to see. They will tell you which buzzwords are good. If there is any conceivable way that you can claim to have experience in an important buzzword, write it down. This is incidentally how the strain of doing this is best managed — by not doing anything more arduous than reading a few jobs and clicking "apply", then not thinking about it until the next day. Don't apply to so many that it feels like even a bit of an ordeal. Do not let rejection affect you, most of the people involved in this process do not deserve your respect in this instance. I am sure they are lovely husbands and wives and sons and we don't care right now. It has taken up to two months before calls have started rolling in, and that is why I'd suggest doing this more-or-less constantly, even when settled into a contract role. You want to know if jobs have suddenly started to dry up, or if you need to make adjustments to your buzzword soup. A fair number of these jobs won't do any sort of diligence. The interview will be fine. Questions will sometimes be on the level of "Do you know Python?", a real question that a real director asked me before paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I've done a few more unpleasant interviews, detailed here, but at this point they don't bother me. If I found myself in another one of these situations, I would hang up mid-call. Eat your assertiveness vegetables, they'll put hair on your chest. Quit. You got this job, you'll get another job. Don't quit, duh. Listen man, I didn't design the industry, but I rolled brown skin and an Indian name at character creation. I'm just doing what I've gotta do. All those jobs will be mediocre, but you won't feel like any particular person has too much power over you. But still, the second job market is where you actually want to be. This is the promised land where people have functioning test suites, the executives know something about the work being undertaken, your colleagues are not Senior Void Gazers who have been so thoroughly beaten down by the industry that they dully repeat "it's a living and I have kids", and as a bonus you're probably paid about 50% more. It is so totally divorced from the first job market that people in it sometimes do not understand that the first job market exists. Famous Netflix-guy-turned-Twitch-streamer, the Primagen, has never even heard of PowerBI, what is probably the most popular analytics tool on the planet. These people are blessed. It is not accessible via Seek. It is accessible entirely through having well-placed friends and a reputation for being a cool person with a modicum of self-respect. You can't generate these by pulling the "apply for job" lever over and over. This way you don't have to pray that your friend's companies are hiring at any given moment, you'll just always know that you've got an interview every few weeks. Because getting in here isn't very predictable, this section is general advice in no particular order. If the company asks you to do Leetcode stuff, my opinion right now is that they're probably at least a bit serious, but I don't think a place that asks you to grovel before entry is a great place to be along non-technical dimensions. Erik Dietrich calls this type of interview "carnival cash", rewarding compliant employees and middle managers with the opportunity to terrorize their fellow humans instead of with money. I'm not that sure about this point. I'd probably be bad at a Leetcode interview, so I'm biased against them. Maybe they're correlated with high quality programming performance in some way that I don't understand. People often say "I don't have any connections" or "My network is terrible". This was a 0% judgement zone earlier. It is now a 0% sympathy zone. There is a phenomenon I refer to called "trying to try". It can be broadly summarized as any set of behaviors where someone has not seriously engaged their brain, does not really believe that they're doing anything with a serious chance of success, and are more-or-less just looking for reasons to say that they tried but failed. This happens in subtle places — for example, when training with beginner sabre fencers, you can stand perfectly immobile and they will very consistently hit your blade instead of you. They are so panicked and upset that their body is not trying to win, simply going through the motions of what fencing looks like. This manifests in all sorts of ways that I'll talk about one day, but it's so apparent in the job search. "I've applied for fifty jobs and no one responded". A good indicator that you're trying to try is that you are: Most people tell me they've applied for jobs and didn't get responses. Slightly savvier people tell me they've sent some cold emails out. Some people beyond that say they've started attending Meetups but had no luck. None of them have done anything remotely interesting or otherwise indicative of novel thought. I got my first programming job by emailing Josh Wiley from my psychology degree, a man who did not know me at all, but I had been in one lecture with him, and his wife was the only senior academic honest enough to tell me not to undertake a PhD. I still have the original email. We had a brief back-and-forth, and two weeks later one of his colleagues said "One of my PhD students is freaking out because they can't process some data in R", and that got me my first paid programming job, processing microsaccade data in sleep-deprived drivers. A few weeks later, I saw that a data analyst job was up for grabs at a nearby university. The smooth brained thing to do would have been to apply via Seek and get ignored. I instead went on LinkedIn, looked up the company, look up the word "lead" and cold messaged someone who seemed like they might have something to do with the job. This led me to Dave Coulter, who I still catch up every few months, and a job offer that let me skip straight to being a mid-level engineer. During the interview, when they asked "Have you programmed professionally?", I described the microsaccade project and they hired me. I didn't mention that it was about thirty hours of work in total, and they didn't ask. I actually lost the original position to someone with six more years of experience, who was offered the original data analyst role or a much more highly-paid contract. They wanted the stability, so they took the permanent role, leaving me with a massive pay bump for the contract role, and we both quit at the same time anyway. And they do not conceptualize it as losing tends of thousands of dollars, but they were functionally unemployed for months relative to what they could have earned. Score one for contracts. Those still ended up being mediocre jobs, but I just wanted to illustrate that there is a level of trying that looks more like "there is a gun to my head and I'm willing to do unorthodox things to survive", and the people that email me for jobs have never reached the unorthodox part of that. Presumably that people that do reach this point do not need to email me for jobs. I woke up this morning to an email from Dan Tentler from Phobos about safe ways to run Incus with NixOS images pre-loaded with Airflow and an overlay VPN to client sites. Dan learned about Phobos from a group of hackers in Oslo. I learned about overlay VPNs in December from the CTO of Hyprefire, Stefan Prandl, when asking for advice on network security. I have a discussion about something like this every day, even if it isn't in the tech space. Before that, at a relatively "decent" engineering company, the most complex discussion I had was trying to explain to someone that their Snowflake workload was crashing because they were trying to read 2M+ records into a hash map and that this takes a lot of memory. I have learned more in the last three months than I have in the previous three years, basically along every dimension of my profession. I'm trying to catch up for years of working with mediocre performers, and it's hard. It's definitely doable, and remember that I'm doing this while spending half my time on sales so you can do it faster than me, but there is a real cost to not working with really great people. I've studied hard over the past few years, but nothing comes close to just having awesome people around you. This matters because really good teams don't hire total scrubs that haven't taken control of their education. The first job market does not reward skill or personal development. The second one does actually require you to be good. The best offer I've received from a good company (A$185K) was obtained not through Seek, but by meeting my current co-founder Ash Lally during the preparation for a game of Twilight Imperium IV where I absolutely smoked everyone. The only other place that I've considered might be acceptable to settle down, much better than the offer I received through Ash, at was the result of getting coffee with a local reader, then eventually being invited to drinks with their team a few times. We mostly talked about split keyboards and Star Citizen. It has been a few months since I quit my last job, and I used to say all sorts of conciliatory things like "Sure, that engineer is terrible, but most of them are good!", but money talks. I only offered one of them a job with me. In retrospect, most of them had the potential to be good, but enough years in a typical corporate setting will ruin this. When I was 20, people were happy to hire me because I had potential. Now, potential is still important, but it's important that I've at least demonstrated that some of it is manifesting. Many engineers have pathologies that I think make them unsuitable for work on a healthy team, in the same way that some people need to do some self-work to enter a healthy relationship. For example, I know many people who feel guilty taking time off, so they'll burn themselves out without someone constantly getting them to slow down. I'm sympathetic, but a team as small as mine doesn't have time to walk someone through that level of self-harm and still deliver for clients reliably. We help each other through lots of little quirks we need to deprogram out of corporate contexts, but we need to be starting from a place of some progress. An example that Modal's Jonathon Belotti sent my way is that Modal's most high-performing team members will get a two week deadline, then confidently spend the entirety of the first week reading a book on the technology they're about to use. Most engineers I know, including myself a few years ago, would rather hack incompetently for two weeks. The essential reason for this is being too underconfident to act on our beliefs about how engineering should be done (or worse, not having those beliefs at all), and we'd rather fail in the approved, was-working-visibly fashion than risk looking unorthodox. "I programmed the whole two weeks and failed!" feels easier to justify than "I read a book for one of those weeks and failed!". But team members should be picked for their judgement, and if they are good for the team in proportion to the quality of that judgement and their willingness to exercise it in the face of orthodoxy. People are awful at asking for work. Here is how I advise people do it. If you don't have a good time, just leave it be. You're here to rekindle old relationships and meet interesting people, and maybe they can help you out. The moment you start asking people for help that you don't even want as friends is the moment that the entire endeavour becomes sleazy. I think of each person I know (in the context of job searching) as some sort of machine that randomly spits out jobs in a uniform distribution over a year. Let's say each person has a 5% chance of turning up a job every month, maybe more or less depending on the market. If you want an 80% chance at a job every month, you have to have enough people with you in mind that you're rolling the dice enough times to get that number. Many people tell me that they attended a few Meetups and had no results, even though that's what you're supposed to do. It's good that they tried, but most large Meetups seem to be populated by people who are ineffectually looking for jobs. Don't be ineffectual. Large Meetups were frustrating when I was a student because everyone interesting was swarmed by students trying desperately to look employable without being needy, and it is frustrating as a non-student because now I get swarmed. People go "Oh, I am a data scientist, I will go to the Data Science Meetup". That's better than not going out at all, but strictly inferior to going to a tiny Meetup with ten nerds that are deeply into Elixir or some other niche bit of technology. You will form real connections with the latter, and the fact that you know what Clojure is will be enough to make many people at such a place want to work with you. If you are in a city with a functioning tech industry and can't think of any interesting technology, then it's going to be really hard to justify why you deserve a spot on a good team, so maybe solve that problem first. If you're decent at writing and have opinions on something... write. It's amazing for meeting people. I have several readers that have sent me their writing, and without any intervention from me, about 30% of them hit the front-page of Hackernews on the strength of their material. There are surprisingly few people putting out good material on almost all topics, especially in the age of LLM slop. Reader Mira Welner wrote about something as generic as Git checkout and hit the front-page. Bernardo Stein, mentioned in various places on the blog as the guy that coaches me through my worst engineering impulses from my corporate career, has front-paged by writing about NixOS. Nat Bennett, who I've been getting advice from for months and am now hiring to coach my team, front-paged Hackernews writing about the notebook they keep at new jobs. Even Scott Smitelli, who I quoted earlier for having wrote this fantastic piece emailed it to me, and before I could finish reading it people were already recommending it to me through other channels. It's super easy to meet people through writing if you aren't afraid of pushing out your real opinions and indeed, you will see extremely stupid comments on all of the above writing, so you will need to be unafraid. Fine. Tell people that you, personally, are ChatGPT. Someone else may lose their job and think "I wish I hadn't listened to Ludic, he is so stupid and foolish", but I refuse to acknowledge them. ↩ The main one is Gary Donovan who I didn't even meet in the wild. I met a reader for coffee, and that reader worked with a really nice engineering company. That company said Gary is their favourite recruiter. The first time I called him, I said something about Lisp and it turned out he had a copy of The Little Schemer in front of him at that very second, and we later had a great talk about engineering culture in F1 over ramen. I am still reeling at the implications in neuroscience of a recruiter that can read — is it possible that some of them are sentient? ↩ Subscribe via RSS / via Email. Powered by mataroa.blog.

Title: Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom and its chips, financials, and leadership

Time Published: 2025-03-01T20:44:39Z

Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past couple of years. Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem "with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets." The boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia. Nvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky and Priem. Personal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they "wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea." "We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help," he said. "It was fun." Their goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC. By 1999, the year it went public, Nvidia had invented the graphics processing unit, a computer chip that can handle many tasks simultaneously. It had faced challenges; it built two chips that failed, and it nearly went bankrupt. But it had also established itself as a formidable player in the industry, partnering with companies such as Sega, Dell, and Micron and winning rounds of funding from the venture firms Sequoia Capital and Sierra Ventures. In 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming. On Sequoia Capital's "Crucible Moments" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, "Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different." "We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another," he added. Nvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning. The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 800% from the start of 2023 to the start of 2025. Much of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models. Nvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO: Jensen Huang. A 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $110 billion. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. BI identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm. Huang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region. He attended a reform school in Kentucky. In an interview with NPR in 2012, he recalled that "the kids were really tough," adding: "They all had pocket knives — and when they get in fights, it's not pretty. Kids get hurt." He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion. Huang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984. During his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children: Madison Huang, a marketing director at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang, a senior product manager at the company. Jensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia. Huang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company. Nvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers. Nvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3. Demand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups. Last year, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips. But a key to Nvidia's success is CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years. Still, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In AMD's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024, CEO Lisa Su said the company had "closed a good part of" the gap with Nvidia. Nvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips. In January 2025, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft. Nvidia has been competing with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world. It briefly surpassed Apple to take the top spot numerous times in 2024 and again in January 2025, when its market capitalization reached $3.45 trillion. For the fiscal quarter that ended January 26, 2025, Nvidia's earnings call reported record revenue of $39.3 billion, up by 78% from the prior year. Net income for the quarter was more than $22.1 billion, up by 80% from the prior year. Nvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet. It has parks, "treehouses" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure. "When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible," Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023. It's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs "by definition" should have the most direct reports at a company. Huang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a "Jensen grilling." Nvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research. Landing a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.

The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources – precisely the capability essential for organizations seeking to implement Stargate's vision of interconnected AI. As the Stargate framework enables more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments will increase dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for Stargate deployments. The company's AIP offering already demonstrates Palantir's understanding of the need to connect proprietary data with external AI capabilities – a microcosm of what Stargate aims to achieve at a broader scale. This early positioning in the "AI orchestration" market suggests Palantir could emerge as a critical middleware layer in the Stargate ecosystem, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a somewhat higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will make Stargate's promise of interconnected AI a practical reality for enterprises and government agencies. Palantir Technologies saw its stock surge in early February 2025 after strong earnings, only to retreat sharply as concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts weighed on investor sentiment. The stock initially spiked to record highs but has since tumbled 30%, with accelerating selling momentum pushing it toward key support levels. Despite the pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are split—some see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, given Palantir’s role in federal data initiatives. At the same time, technical indicators suggest further downside risk if support near $85, $66, and $44 fails to hold. Investors should watch for a potential recovery toward $100 and $125 if momentum shifts. The Stargate AI Project represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence architecture that could dramatically accelerate AI capabilities by enabling previously isolated systems to work together seamlessly. The five companies profiled – NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, AMD and Palantir – each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to position themselves ahead of this technological evolution. From NVIDIA's dominance in AI hardware to Microsoft's enterprise software integration, Google's fundamental AI research leadership, AMD's competitive computing solutions and Palantir's expertise in complex systems integration, these firms provide complementary exposures to different aspects of the AI value chain that Stargate aims to revolutionize. While valuations remain elevated across the AI sector, these companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else The travel tech industry has seen at least 17 acquisitions so far in 2025, predominantly driven by smaller deals. Private equity firms, with substantial funds to deploy, are leading a surge in acquisitions, particularly in modernizing payment systems. Notable transactions include Shift4's acquisition of Global Blue for $2.5 billion and Flywire's purchase of Sertifi for $330 million, highlighting a significant focus on enhancing payment technologies within the travel sector. Small deals are leading unprecedented M&A activity in travel tech right now, and you'll see that they dominate the list below. As we recently reported, private equity firms have accumulated an estimated $3 trillion that they need to deploy, and roughly $300 billion of that is earmarked for tech. Investment bank AGC Partners says these PE-backed players are going on a “feeding frenzy” to acquire smaller companies and consolidate their respective markets. One area where larger deals are emerging is in travel payments. There have been two such deals in payment tech in recent weeks: Shift4 plans to purchase Global Blue for $2.5 billion, and Flywire just bought Sertifi for $330 million. Paired with two other big deals in the past couple of years, there seems to be a pattern emerging. Amadeus last year acquired Voxel for $123.2 million. And Sabre acquired Conferma Pay in 2022 for $72.5 million. All of these companies are trying to get ahead of a big shift in travel toward modern payment systems, as the industry races to catch up with retail. A survey by Amadeus in 2023 found that ease of payment is the top tech issue for travelers over the next 10 years. Overall, there have been at least 17 acquisitions in travel tech announced since the start of 2025. Here is the breakdown. Shift4, a payments and ecommerce tech company, plans to acquire Global Blue for $2.5 billion. Shift4 provides payments tech to industries including airlines, hotels, food and beverage, and more. Global Blue specializes in tax-free shopping and payment tech, connecting retail and hospitality businesses with international travelers. Shoppers can claim value-added tax (VAT) refunds through the Global Blue platform, and the tech enables them to pay for goods in their own currency. The company’s tech is used in more than 400,000 retail and hospitality locations. (Travelers can get VAT refunds on certain goods — like clothing, accessories, electronics — in the European Union, the UK, and multiple countries in Asia and other regions.) Shift4 says that the deal opens up an entirely new market for the company. Global Blue’s merchant solutions will be added to Shift4’s global payments platform to deliver an enhanced end-to-end experience for its merchants. Shift4 plans to acquire Global Blue for $7.50 per common share in cash. Global Blue will no longer be listed on any public stock exchange following the transaction, which is expected to close by the third quarter of 2025. Flywire, which provides cross-border payments tech for travel companies, has acquired Sertifi for $330 million in a bid to expand services for hotels. Flywire's platform is meant to help travel companies simplify and streamline payments from consumers. Most clients are tour operators, destination management companies, and hotels. The company has about 4,500 clients globally across all the industries it serves, including education and health care. The platform by Chicago-based Sertifi is meant to help hotels streamline events contracting, group bookings, and their associated payments. The company has 20,000 hotel clients, including brands under Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, as well as luxury independent hotels like Sage Hospitality Group and the Corinthia Hotel in London. Sertifi was founded in 2008. (See Skift’s story.) HomeToGo, an online marketplace for vacation rentals, said in February that it plans to acquire Interhome for up to $260 million (€250 million). The purchase price includes $166.5 million (€160 million) upfront and up to $93.6 million (€90 million) in deferred payments for up to four years. Interhome (Germany) is an online marketplace for vacation rentals owned by the Hotelplan Group, which is part of the Migros Corporation. TravelPerk, the corporate travel platform, acquired the expense management startup Yokoy. TravelPerk plans to integrate Yokoy’s tech to become an all-in-one corporate travel and expense platform. TravelPerk recently raised $200 million for the transition and international growth. (See Skift’s story.) Mews, the hotel tech startup, recently bought its 12th company. The company bought New Zealand-based Clarity Hospitality Software Solutions, which provides property and event management systems for hundreds of hotels groups, event venues and independent hotels in the APAC region and the UK. Landfolk, a vacation rental platform founded by former Airbnb employees, acquired Danitalia.com to expand into Italy. Denmark-based Landfolk says it helps owners rent their vacation homes during the majority of the year when they normally would sit empty. The startup had more than 3,000 homes in its portfolio in Denmark, Norway, Germany, and Sweden. The acquisition gives it more than 130 homes in Italy. Landfolk raised $11.2 million in 2024. Real estate tech provider Yardi acquired Deskpass and Hubble, both apps that remote workers can use to book coworking spaces. Deskpass, based in Chicago, says it lists more than 7,900 coworking and shared office spaces in 260 cities. London-based Hubble says it lists thousands of spaces in the UK and beyond. Yardi already operates CoworkingCafe, a marketplace for coworking spaces with more than 21,000 locations. It also operates Yardi Kube, which provides back-office tech for coworking offices. Sabre sold its business-travel booking tool, GetThere, to Serko for $12 million. Serko is a corporate travel management company based in New Zealand. Sabre bought GetThere in August 2000 for $757 million. Along with the purchase, Sabre and Serko began a long-term partnership to invest and grow the GetThere business. Sabre detailed that partnership in October. Serko said last week that it is investing $100 million over the next three years for tech that will power all of its products, including GetThere, Zeno, and Booking.com for Business. Moove, the Uber-backed company that provides financing to help rideshare drivers purchase cars, is expanding into Brazil and Latin America with the acquisition of Kovi. Brazil-based Kovi has car rental and rent-to-own services, as well as a car rental program for rideshare drivers. Moove says the deal increases its global fleet to 36,000 vehicles in 19 cities. It also increases annual recurring revenue to upwards of $275 million, the company said, up from $115 million that it reported in 2024. Moove plans to purchase at least 15,000 vehicles annually as part of its long-term strategy. The company says drivers have completed more than 50 million trips completed in financed vehicles through its Uber partnership. Juniper Group has acquired InteRES, which provides distribution and retail tech for the airline industry. The InteRES owner, who founded the company in 1997, sold his shares along with minority owner TUI Deutschland. Juniper Group is an operating portfolio of Vela Software, one of the six divisions of Toronto-based Constellation Software. Juniper Group owns more than 30 companies, including around a dozen in travel. The company plans to buy as many as a dozen travel tech companies this year, said Jaime Sastre, CEO of Juniper Group, in an interview with Skift in January.

Title: It’s Clearer Than Ever What Jeff Bezos Wants With the Washington Post

In February 2017, for the first time in its long history, the Washington Post adopted an official slogan: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” The motto was a little bit much. Pompous and self-important, it sounded as if the newspaper was really trying to say Without the Washington Post, we’re all screwed. At the time, plenty of rival news outlets—including Slate—ribbed the Post for its portentousness. Democracy Dies in Darkness. OK, guys. Thank God we’ve got George Will to keep the lamps lit for us. And yet, in the years that followed, the Post more or less lived up to the slogan’s implied mandate: to shine a bright light on an ethically bankrupt president and his clown-car administration. Under the editorial leadership of ex–Boston Globe chief Marty Baron and the financial stewardship of its owner, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, the Post excelled during the first Trump administration, buoyed by a tide of subscribers eager to have Donald Trump’s feet held to the fire. From 2016 through 2021, the newspaper turned out lots of great journalism that illuminated the depths of Trump’s self-dealing. From David Fahrenthold’s coverage of Trump’s alleged charitable giving to the paper’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the Post rose to its own challenge and generated what was arguably the newspaper’s best body of work since the Watergate era. The Post’s keen focus on Trump and his many lickspittles wasn’t just a case of “Trump derangement syndrome.” It was an editorial strategy that was required by a historic moment. The president’s unfitness for office was the era’s most important story, and as D.C.’s hometown newspaper, the Post was obliged to cover it from every possible angle. For Bezos, it surely didn’t hurt that this editorial strategy also made good business sense: In 2019, CNN reported that “the Post went from hemorrhaging advertising revenue to becoming a profitable business in 2016, and continuing to be profitable not just in 2017, but also in 2018.” Trump left town in disgrace in January 2021, seemingly bound for an ignominious retirement. In his inauguration speech, Trump’s successor, “Amtrak” Joe Biden, announced that “democracy had prevailed.” It had, albeit briefly—and by shining its light so vividly for so long on Trump and his cronies, the Post deserved a small share of the credit. Times have changed. It is now 2025, Trump is back in office, and Washington Post readers are learning to their horror that darkness isn’t the only condition under which democracy can die. Sometimes, it also dies at the hands of people like Jeff Bezos: pragmatic oligarchs with diversified business portfolios who ultimately care less about defending democracy than about not losing money by doing so. For the past year or so, and certainly ever since it became clear that the Democrats were waging an uphill battle in the 2024 presidential election, Bezos has been conspicuously remaking the Post into an entity that seems primarily focused on not antagonizing Donald Trump. In the process, he has hollowed out the editorial staff and squandered the journalistic legacy that makes the Washington Post worth owning and operating in the first place. On Wednesday, various outlets reported that Bezos had informed Post staffers that the newspaper’s opinion section would thenceforth be focusing on “personal liberty and free markets.” Claiming that the internet had obviated the daily newspaper’s previous responsibility to offer “a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,” Bezos argued that “free markets and personal liberties are right for America,” and that he was excited for Post Opinion to focus on those topics going forward—as opposed to, you know, the jackbooted horrors of the second Trump administration. (“Bravo, @JeffBezos!” wrote Elon Musk on the website formerly known as Twitter.) The announcement was just the latest humiliating turn in the newspaper’s depressing recent narrative of ownership-driven decline. In 2023, amid a reported $77 million loss, the paper shed hundreds of jobs through a combination of layoffs and buyouts, which may have saved Bezos some money, but which also inevitably affected the paper’s ability to produce the sort of wide-ranging, high-quality journalism that made it worth reading in the first place. In 2024, to help turn the paper’s financial tide, Bezos installed some nitwit from Great Britain as publisher, who buzzed in with a bunch of stupid ideas about newsroom reorganization; drove off the paper’s relatively new editor in chief, Sally Buzbee; and attempted to stop the Post from covering his own alleged involvement in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. In October of last year, under Bezos’ direct instructions, the Post editorial board refrained from endorsing a presidential candidate, a cowardly decision that led a quarter-million Post readers to cancel their subscriptions. In January, the New York Times reported that the Post had internally debuted a new motto, one that was much less strident than its public-facing slogan: “Riveting Storytelling for All of America.” The All in that motto tells the tale, with its tacit implication that the newspaper’s previous focus on carefully reported and argued stories and columns that reflected poorly on Donald Trump was only for part of America—the liberal part. Bezos’ unilateral remaking of the Post’s opinion section this week—the section’s editor, David Shipley, resigned upon receiving the mandate, and he really had no other choice—is of a piece with all these other moves. Taken together, it starts to seem clear that, for Bezos, the Post has become a pawn in a much larger game. I don’t think that Bezos is neutering the Post because he’s suddenly gone full MAGA, or because he honestly believes that the newspaper’s ideal editorial strategy involves driving away its best reporters and columnists while mimicking the worst parts of CNN and the Wall Street Journal. I think he’s making moves with an eye toward mollifying an intensely vindictive president and thus improving the near-term fate of his other, much more prominent business ventures. If the Post had a different, less flush owner, maybe you could be swayed by any of the woe-is-us C-suite wailing about the newspaper’s plummeting revenue, subscription, and traffic numbers. But Bezos has long been on the short list of the wealthiest people in human history, and he could afford to underwrite an optimal version of the Post in perpetuity and never notice a dent in his $220 billion personal fortune. He could, right now, choose to run the Post the way that Steve Cohen chooses to run the New York Mets: by throwing so much money at top talent that they can’t afford to not work there. (I myself do not fall into the “top editorial talent” category, but I would nevertheless gladly accept utility infielder money to step in and write occasional columns when the good reporters need days off.) This sort of benevolent stewardship was what lots of people hoped for when Bezos bought the Post from the storied Graham family in 2013, and by now it is unfortunately clear that Bezos has other ambitions. (The Graham Holdings Company owns Slate.) Given how his recent meddling has sunk the Post’s financial position even deeper, it’s hard to believe Bezos’ goal is really to get the Post to pay for itself. The Post doesn’t need to pay for itself as long as Bezos is around to pay for it; and even if it did, it’s hard to see how alienating existing customers while pandering to the sorts of people who hate the Washington Post is a viable long-term strategy. I think it’s more that Bezos is bent on ensuring that the Post’s political coverage does not endanger the profit potential of any of his other businesses. The Washington Post is a minor, minor component of Bezos’ business portfolio. Much more central to the billionaire’s past, present, and future fortune are the world-devouring Amazon.com and his spaceflight startup, Blue Origin. Trump’s return to office alongside the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Bezos and his other businesses. As Trump and Musk hollow out the federal government, they are leaving behind a massive void that will inevitably be filled by private industry. Services once provided by humans will start to be provided by A.I., a field in which Amazon has already invested billions. If the U.S. Postal Service is gutted, it will create additional opportunities for companies like Amazon with worldwide logistics infrastructures; if NASA and the Pentagon shrink, there’ll be more money to funnel to private contractors such as Blue Origin. The cuts that Musk and the Trump Cabinet are making represent a potential windfall for Bezos and his businesses—assuming, of course, that he’s able to stay on Trump’s good side. Robustly covering the many terrible things happening in the second Trump administration is a great way to get and stay on Trump’s bad side, though, and in order to understand why Bezos seems to be deliberately ruining the Washington Post, you need to view the changes he’s making there through that transactional lens. If Bezos plays nice with Trump by refocusing the Post’s coverage away from his administration, then maybe Trump’s Federal Trade Commission might even wind down its antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. If the Post were to double down on its prior hard coverage of the Trump administration, though, Bezos might end up frozen out of the private-industry gold rush that’s soon to come, and might have to keep dealing with antitrust suits for years. There’s a world of difference between the first Trump administration and the second, as we’re all now aware. Eight years ago, normal people were mostly shocked and angry that America elected such a narcissistic, incompetent boob to the presidency—and most of America’s business leaders chose to cater to this righteous anger. The Trump administration felt like a historical aberration, and thus there was no real business reason to normalize or collaborate with it. Today, though, the “resistance” is tapped out, the boobs are in ascendance, and Trumpism is no longer an aberration. Instead, it’s an opportunity space for Bezos, and Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg, and all the other craven big-money chickenshits to whom democracy only ever mattered as part of a marketing slogan. They will gladly help set the world on fire as long as they can bid on the contract to clear the debris. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: He quit his government job after 5 months for a higher-paying tech role. Here's how he marketed himself for the switch.

When Kunal Sonalkar graduated from the University of Florida in 2017 with a master's degree in computer science, his career aspiration was to be a data scientist at a Big Tech company. But he soon found out it wasn't going to be easy to reach his goal. "Data science was a growing field then, and there weren't many entry-level roles for data scientists or machine learning engineers," Sonalkar told Business Insider. "I almost got no interview callbacks from the bigger firms." During a career fair, he met some recruiters from a state government agency focused on water resources, landed an interview, and was hired as an entry-level data analyst. While Sonalkar found his government job "super interesting" and appreciated the chance to work with brilliant environmental scientists, he felt constrained by the scale of his work. "I wanted to work on big data systems and large-scale projects, and I wasn't getting a chance to work on that," he said. Sonalkar also felt that despite his employer's desire to leverage technology, budget constraints often limited the government sector's ability to invest in new technologies and software. The compensation was also much lower than that of the private sector, which included company stocks and RSUs. After just five months in his government role, at age 26, Sonalkar decided to pivot to a private-sector job as a data science analyst at a retail healthcare company. His new role also came with a significant pay hike, and within one-and-a-half years, his salary was nearly 50% higher than that of his government job. After about two-and-a-half years at the healthcare company, he landed a data analytics and machine learning role at a supermarket chain. Today, the 32-year-old is a data scientist at Nordstrom. Sonalkar translated his government-sector accomplishments into measurable results that demonstrated his impact on efficiency, cost savings, and process improvements. For example, he worked on several initiatives that improved workflow processes at his government agency, saving his team many manual hours. "I quantified this project — how much manual effort did we reduce, what were the cost savings associated with this project, how did we use automation tools to improve the existing process — and showcased it in my résumé," he explained. His strategy was to search "[company name] + role + LinkedIn" to find people who were working or who had worked in the companies and roles he was interested in. After sending initial invites to these professionals, he set up a coffee chat and told them about his experiences and what exactly he was looking for in a new role. "You can build a strong network just by doing this," Sonalkar said. When working in the government agency, Sonalkar developed a complete module to automate the agency's reporting system. "When you highlight these large-scale projects, explaining how you navigated through them and what the tradeoffs and challenges were, it goes a long way with the hiring manager," he said. "These skills are highly valued in the private sector." There were also some things Sonalkar wished he had known before transitioning out of a government job. Sonalkar didn't realize that private sector jobs move much faster than government jobs, with a greater emphasis on quick decision-making and rapid implementation of new technologies. "On the government front, we used to experience this occasionally if there were floods or water issues in a county, but for the most part, it was smooth sailing," he said. "We used to have timelines for our deliverables, but nothing too crazy." Sonalkar quickly discovered that tech jobs require always remaining a student, constantly learning and upskilling yourself — something he personally enjoys and participates in. "I've been constantly enrolling myself in new courses," Sonalkar said, something his manager has been very supportive of. For example, Sonalkar learned Tableau and enrolled himself in certifications from Amazon Web Services, which taught him how to train and host AI models on their cloud platform. He's also recently taken courses on building generative AI applications, finetuning open-source AI models, and deploying these models into production environments. In the government sector, if Sonalkar's team wanted to try out a new technology, they had to make a very detailed case about why they needed that investment. He found this not to be the case in his non-government jobs. "The private sector is liberal, and you'll have room to try out new methods — fail faster and succeed sooner," he said. Sonalkar said he no longer struggles with the problems that government jobs often come with, like limited compensation and salary growth, slow decision-making processes, and inertia to change. However, he also acknowledged drawbacks of the private sector, such as shaky job security due to ongoing Big Tech layoffs and potentially longer working hours with stricter timelines, whereas government jobs traditionally have offered better work-life balance and a sense of public service. Sonalkar's aspirations to become a data scientist at a Big Tech company have evolved over time, thanks to his work with AI and machine learning methods at Nordstrom. "I feel retail — especially e-commerce — has a ton of applications to leverage some of the recent developments happening in AI," Sonalkar said. "Rather than focusing on where I work, I plan to prioritize the kind of work I'm doing." Sonalkar plans to remain in the private sector for the foreseeable future, but he doesn't view this as a permanent departure from public service. "AI can be a game-changer for government efficiency and service delivery," he said, pointing to uses such as optimizing resource allocation and improving citizen engagement. "Its successful implementation often requires the expertise and resources of the private sector," he said, adding that it's a public-private collaboration he'd be interested in helping facilitate.

Title: A top 3% fund manager warns a 'multi-year bear market' is coming with stocks in the biggest momentum swing of his 45-year career

Investors have enjoyed sunny days over the last two-and-a-half years thanks to a strong economy and enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. But at some point, it's going to rain, warns Smead Capital Management founder Bill Smead. Smead styles himself as a modern-day Noah of the financial world, drawing on the biblical tale of Noah's Ark. By that he means he's continuing to lean into value stocks as the growth factor remains frothy. "Everything we have studied about common stocks, including The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith, and from listening to the wise words of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett for decades leads us to believe that we must build a common stock portfolio which will float when the multi-year bear market creates a waterfall of selling among magnificent growth stocks and passive S&P 500 Index owners," Smead wrote in a recent letter to investors. Smead's downcast outlook stems in part from how fast this rally has unfolded. "It is the most all-encompassing momentum market of my 45 years in the investing business," he wrote. The prospect of persistent inflation also concerns Smead. He said the mismatch between commodity supplies and the high demand for them will keep prices rising, as will ongoing wage increases. "Ask the dock workers or Boeing machinists what a long-term union contract that raises your income 8.5% per year compounded means," Smead wrote. "Ask the U.S. Postal Service why they are raising last-mile delivery prices by 60% and forcing UPS to cut Amazon deliveries in half!" Inflation has proved sticky since coming down from its 2022 highs, sitting consistently in a range near 3%. President Donald Trump's tariff threats have incited fears of a further reignition of inflation. Rising prices have historically been bad news for stocks when they're highly expensive, particularly those of the growth tilt. Right now, stocks are at some of their highest valuation levels in history as far as the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio goes. However, some investors have also started to worry that economic growth could start to slow enough to send the economy into recession. Falling yields on the 10-year Treasury note, a risk-free asset, are one signal that investors are seeking safety. Yields on bonds fall when their prices rise. For the moment, however, jobless claims have remained virtually flat. One might expect a value manager like Smead to have a gloomy forecast in a growth-driven market like this. But there's no denying Smead's eye for picking winners. According to Morningstar data, his Smead Value Fund (SMVLX) has beaten 97% of similar funds over the last 15 years. He also crushed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2022 before AI exuberance sent the benchmark index soaring. In 2021, Smead returned 37% compared to the S&P 500's 26.9%. And in 2022, when the S&P 500 fell 19.4%, SMVLX was down only 4.4%. Smead's current top-five holdings in order include Simon Property Group (SPG), American Express (AXP), Macerich (MAC), Merck (MRK), and DR Horton (DHI). All of them have weightings above 5%. Jump to

Title: McLaren sponsor Glanbia faces struggle convincing investors it can get back on track

The McLaren Formula One racing team was euphoric on Wednesday when its star driver, Lando Norris, set the pace for the field in the first day of preseason testing in Bahrain, before Melbourne hosts the initial grand prix of 2025 next month. The mood wasn’t shared, however, by the owners of McLaren’s sports nutrition sponsor, protein powders business Optimum Nutrition. Shares in Glanbia, which bought Optimum Nutrition in 2008 and turned it into a $1 billion-plus (€960 million) concern, went into sharp reverse the same day – slumping 23 per cent – as it warned that a surge in whey protein prices had caught its team off guard, and it went about getting rid of its problem SlimFast and Body & Fit businesses. It has caused investors to seriously question the Kilkenny-based group’s ability to forecast the price of the key ingredient for its products – and its deal making. Glanbia is the biggest producer of whey protein in the US through its cheese joint venture factories in Idaho, New Mexico and Michigan. But it is also the world’s main buyer of the commodity to stock the cupboards of gym-goers and dieters with protein powers and shakes. Chief executive Hugh McGuire, who succeeded Siobhán Talbot at the helm a year ago, rattled investors in November when he signalled that high whey prices would weigh on margins in its biggest division, Performance Nutrition, where Optimum Nutrition accounts for two-thirds of sales. He conceded this week that the scale and extent of the spike – with high-end whey prices currently 20 per cent above a previous peak in 2022 – was “beyond what we previously planned for”. It has prompted analysts to slash their earnings estimates for the next few years. The company’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $1.24-$1.30 was above 11 per cent below what analysts, on average, had been estimating. Chief financial officer Mark Garvey – who was last year granted a stock incentive award, worth €750,000 at the time, to remain with the company for at least two years as McGuire’s right-hand man – told analysts the elevated prices will be “transitory”. That’s because plans by cheese producers in the US to build new plants, following a pause in projects as a result of the Covid pandemic, will increase capacity by 15-20 per cent between late 2025 and through next year. History suggests that increased capacity will push down prices, he said. But ongoing weakness in the stock suggests the market is short on faith as the episode stokes up memories of an unfortunate series of profit warnings from the group in 2019. “This is the second whey-driven downgrade in three to four months and, given the current trajectory of prices, we struggle to have conviction at this point on a moderation in prices,” said Deutsche Numis analyst Deirdre Mullaney. Glanbia sees higher whey prices resulting in $200 million of additional costs this year. It aims to offset three-quarters of that, mainly by way of increasing prices and cutting its marketing budget. It will be difficult to achieve, without hitting volumes. Optimum Nutrition sales barely rose last year as Glanbia cut pricing to boost volumes in the face of heightened competition as the likes of Costco, the members-only warehouse club retailer, launched low-cost powders at a time of consumer caution – and habitual dieters opted for weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic in droves. Still, Glanbia executives believe their protein powders should ultimately benefit from the GPL-1 revolution. However, strong sales outside the US helped lift the brand’s total revenues by 7.5 per cent. Glanbia’s decision to get rid of SlimFast shouldn’t surprise. Talbot purchased SlimFast for $350 million in late 2018 (a fraction of the $2.9 billion Unilever had spent on it in 2000) and managed a mini revival of a brand that had its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, as it played into the low-carb keto diet craze. The pandemic put paid to that fad. Ozempic hasn’t helped. Glanbia took a $91 impairment charge against the asset last year as it prepares it for sale. Dutch-based Body & Fit, an online sales platform for protein bars, wraps and powders that Glanbia bought in 2017 for €181 million to open a new sales front to consumers, has also had its day. The explosive growth of Shopify Amazon since then means that running a specialist ecommerce platform is an expense Glanbia doesn’t need. The group took a $46 million charge against this asset last year as it put it on the block. Analysts from Berenberg to Kepler Cheuvreux have welcomed management’s decision to hive off SlimFast and Body & Fit, as neither deal delivered what was hoped for. But it does raise questions about the group’s ability to identify attractive deals. The general view from analysts is that the stock has been oversold this week. “The loss on the share price seems excessive,” said Fatma-Agnes Hamdani, an analyst with Oddo BHF Securities. “Glanbia remains well positioned to take advantage of the strong trend on whey protein, while waiting for supply to normalise from the second half [of 2025] onward. We think that 2025 will be a transitional year.” They point out that the group’s balance sheet remains strong, allowing it to buy back €102 million of shares last year and for the board to sign off on a further €148 million of stock repurchases going forward. Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Patrick Higgins said on Friday that Glanbia’s shares – changing hands at a little over €11 – are now trading at “a significantly greater than warranted discount” to peers.

Welcome to SurvivalBlog’s Precious Metals Month in Review, where we take a look at “the month that was” in precious metals. Each month, we cover gold’s performance and silver’s performance and examine the factors that affected the metal prices. Even during the shortest month of the year, the precious metals markets packed in quite a lot of action. Prices ended basically back where they started, but there was a good deal of volatility in between. Both silver and gold rose on each of the first three trading days of February. The gold price advanced 2.4% over that span, reaching an all-time high of $2,861 per troy ounce on Feb. 5th. During that same period the silver price added 3.5%. Silver gave back 47 cents on Friday, Feb. 7th before rebounding back above the $32/oz mark the following Monday. Spot gold closed above $2,900/oz for the first time ever that same day, Feb. 10th. The metals bounced up and down throughout the week of Valentine’s Day. Gold touched yet another new record high of $2,929/oz on Thursday, Feb. 13th, yet it sold off rather swiftly the next day. On Tuesday, Feb. 18th, the yellow metal notched yet another all-time high above $2,930 while silver jumped 41 cents higher to $32.78/oz. The silver price reached its high point for the month on Feb. 20th, closing just six cents shy of the key $33/oz level. The final week of February saw gold snap its streak of eight consecutive weekly gains, but not before it registered one more record-high price of $2,953/oz on Monday, Feb. 24th. The next day saw both precious metals suffer a swift downward correction: the gold price lost 1.3% during the trading session and spot silver shed 68 cents to fall to $31.65/oz. The same pattern repeated on Feb. 27th and 28th, with two more days of losses to close the month. Silver erased all of its gains from the first three weeks of February to end at $31.08/oz, 0.2% lower than where it started. Gold finished at $2,853/oz, an increase of $60 (+2.1%). The focus of the metals market over the past several weeks has echoes of Jan from The Brady Bunch: tariffs, tariffs, tariffs! These newly-erected trade barriers are affecting the whole of the commodities complex, with prices climbing for natural gas, eggs, coffee, orange juice, and a slew of other natural resources. As I cautioned in January, however, the explanation that tariffs are the primary force driving precious metals prices higher is likely to be proven incorrect in retrospect. Something much bigger is playing out with regard to a realignment of the global monetary order. A bold claim, to be sure. But let us consider the following: There has been an alarmingly heavy flow of physical gold out of hubs in London and Switzerland and into vaults in New York. The volume of gold bars crossing the Atlantic is estimated to be 2,000 metric tons in a span of two months. In the meantime, the idea of auditing the gold held in Fort Knox is legitimately being floated around. Even the Treasury Secretary of the United States is openly talking about a new Bretton Woods, for crying out loud. Not since the 1970s has the reality that gold is money been more glaringly present in the public consciousness. The normally staid Financial Times described it as “the unimaginable becomes imaginable.” These are nearly unprecedented developments. Undoubtedly some of the volatility in the gold market can be explained by the unpredictable responses by governments around the world to the fast pace of changes being enacted by the Trump administration. Recent action in the broader financial markets indicates that money is rushing to the sidelines, with investors preferring to wait out the storm from safer harbors. Aside from what’s going on in the White House, the U.S. Congress is considering a budget that purportedly cuts spending by $2 trillion. Although it is true that these fiscal austerity measures would be a welcome change from the outright profligacy we’ve come to expect from the D.C. Beltway, they will almost certainly have a deflationary effect—which, on the one hand, should help quell inflation, but on the other hand it may cause the economy to contract sharply for a time. Meanwhile, there has been far less headline-worthy news about silver, other than some reasonable questioning about why governments don’t hold silver reserves in addition to gold. (Mexico, India, and the United States did so in the past, but to my knowledge the only one that does today is the Russian central bank.) Note to readers: Most data about international gold reserves are delayed by a month. They are not typically reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are instead compiled by private organizations such as the World Gold Council (WGC). Total central bank gold purchases in 2024 clocked in at 1,045 tons. It was the third straight year exceeding 1,000 tons and the 15th consecutive year of net purchases. According to the IMF, the Central Bank of Taiwan bought 1 ton of gold in October. It holds 424 tons in total. The People’s Bank of China purchased 5 tons of gold in January, bringing its (officially reported) stockpile to 2,285 tons—equivalent to 73.45 million troy ounces. The central bank of Uzbekistan added 8 tons of gold to its reserves in January. It has 391 tons in total. The Reserve Bank of India bought 3 tons of gold in January. It holds 879 tons overall. The National Bank of Kazakhstan bought 4 tons of gold in January, increasing its reserves to 288 tons. The Qatar Central Bank added 1.3 tons of gold reserves in January for a total of 112.1 tons. The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan increased its gold holdings by 20 tons in the fourth quarter of last year. It bought 45 tons over the course of 2024 and holds 147 tons of gold in aggregate (21% of its total assets). The fund says it plans to buy more gold in 2025, making it perhaps the only sovereign wealth fund to state this publicly. January tends to be the strongest month on the calendar in terms of silver sales at the United States Mint, and this year was no different. The mint sold 3,563,000 of its 1 oz American Silver Eagle coins during the month. It additionally sold 63,500 oz of Gold Eagle coins. A surprising amount of the gold coin sales were for half-ounce and quarter-ounce coins; this is probably because of bullion stackers who wanted a collection of the new 2025-dated coins across all denominations. While still incomplete, the latest February production data show 514,000 Silver Eagles sold and 4,000 oz of gold coins sold. Scrap silver companies are seeing a 50% reduction in volume in 2025 compared to 2021, suggesting the physical supply of silver remains abnormally tight. In an almost unheard-of turn of events, the mainstream news is regularly talking about gold. Even CNBC and Bloomberg are covering the Treasury Department potentially revaluing its gold reserves, which technically still sit on the Treasury’s books at a value of just $42.22 per ounce. Senator Rand Paul voiced support for a Fort Knox gold audit as the idea continues to gain momentum. The Shanghai Futures Exchange experienced a record-high daily outflow of silver on Feb. 19th. Exports of gold from Singapore to the U.S. hit a three-year high in January. London’s gold shortage may be a symptom of global economic anxiety, according to ZeroHedge. London vaults have lost 11% of their silver inventory in the last two months. As has been widely discussed, much of those outflows are ending up in U.S. warehouses. Accordingly, gold lease rates—i.e. the cost for banks to borrow gold—continue to skyrocket in London. Similarly, the fees to borrow shares of the GLD ETF are exploding higher. Gold delivery notices for February on the COMEX hit a record high, even above the 2020 spike during covid. Major Swiss and German gold refiners are experiencing stress and have resorted to either imposing hefty surcharges or suspending orders altogether. Switzerland’s gold exports in January swelled to 235 tons, with 193 tons going to the U.S. alone. Sanctioned Russian gold bars are still finding their way to Swiss refineries. 7 out of 10 wealthy Koreans report investing in gold. Banks in South Korea are seeing a shortage of silver bars amid rabid demand. The country’s government mint announced it is no longer supplying gold bars to commercial banks following the Korea Gold Exchange making the same move in November. Likewise, banks in China are simply running out of gold. The Chinese mega-retailer JD.com is also out of stock of many gold bars. Costco is facing delays in shipments of precious metal products. (Yes, even Costco sells gold and silver.) Gold bullion banking is launching in Indonesia. It’s estimated that 1,800 tons of gold are held privately by Indonesian citizens. Lawmakers in Wyoming approved a plan to buy $10 million worth of gold for a state strategic reserve. Legislation advanced in Idaho to cut taxes by over $250 million, including removing any capital gains tax on gold and silver. The Montana legislature is currently considering a bill that would do the same. The Virginia legislature unanimously passed a bill to exempt bullion from sales tax until 2027. Goldman Sachs increased its year-end gold price forecast to the range of $3,100–$3,300/oz. Analysts at Bank of America have been “discussing” a gold price target of $3,500/oz. The “In Gold We Trust” report published by Incrementum has a probability-weighted gold price of $4,000–$5,000 by the year 2030. We can hope that March will bring more clarity to the global trade war that’s brewing, but all bets are off at this rate. Even though across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico were postponed until April 2nd, the president has already announced 10% tariffs on Chinese exports; 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports; potential duties on copper imports; and a possible 25% tariff on all exports from the European Union. (This list is far from exhaustive.) Maybe this high level of uncertainty will continue to fuel gold’s steady march higher, as we’ve seen throughout 2025. It will also be important to keep tabs on the U.S.-led negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the proposed resolution to the conflict in Gaza. The Federal Reserve will meet again on March 18th and 19th. The Fed won’t have another opportunity to adjust interest rates until May. As was suggested here last month, $33 per ounce was a key ceiling for the silver price to break through if a rally higher was in the offing. Alas, it fell just short of that milestone and never quite recovered. Next month will be another opportunity. I stand by my conviction that silver will ultimately outperform gold by the end of the year. — About The Author: Everett Millman is a market analyst with Gainesville Coins.

Title: Wall Street Is Shying Away From The 'Mag-7' As $1.4 Trillion In Value Leaks Out

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Tech giants that have dominated Wall Street for two years are losing their grip, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks shedding about $1.4 trillion in market value since December, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven index—tracking Apple Inc AAPL, Nvidia Corp NVDA, Microsoft Corp MSFT, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL)) GOOGL, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc META and Tesla Inc TSLA—has fallen roughly 10% from its December peak, officially entering correction territory. Don't Miss: Tesla has been the hardest hit, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet. Elon Musk‘s electric vehicle maker initially surged after President Donald Trump‘s November election victory but has since faced declining sales and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Meta stands as the lone bright spot, bucking the downward trend as investors endorse its AI strategy. The Facebook parent recorded a 19-day winning streak in February, adding more than $320 billion in market value. “The stock market has lost its leadership,” Jim Paulsen, an independent market strategist, told the Financial Times. Trending: The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum It's a pivot from 2023 and 2024, when the seven companies posted enormous gains and drove the broader market higher. The Magnificent Seven had surged more than 160% between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, according to the FT, but the index has added just 1% so far this year. Investors are rotating into other sectors, with U.S. bank stocks attracting almost $2 billion in the week ended Feb. 3—the second-largest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Bank of America data cited by FT. Healthcare companies, European equities, gold, and smaller tech groups have also benefited from this repositioning. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Meanwhile, money is increasingly flowing toward privately held tech companies, with Anthropic, Coreweave, Databricks, OpenAI, Perplexity, ScaleAI and xAI—now dubbed the “Private Magnificent Seven,” seeing their cumulative valuation rise 40% between July and January, according to FT. Most market watchers view the broadening gains as healthy for what had become an expensive, top-heavy market. However, JPMorgan analysts led by Mislav Matejka caution that faster AI adoption and fewer barriers to entry could spell long-term trouble for the established tech giants. “Historically, it was never the incumbents which benefited from technological disruption, but the outsiders,” Matejka told FT.

February 28, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Rocket Lab securities between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until April 28, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: Google’s co-founder tells AI staff to stop ‘building nanny products’

Also: more on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. Also: more on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. by Alex Heath For the last couple years, it has been evident that Google cofounder Sergey Brin is back in the building. This week, he sent a clear message to hundreds of employees in Google’s DeepMind AI division, known as GDM: the pressure to win the AGI race is on. “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM,” begins his note, which The New York Times first reported on yesterday and I’m publishing below in full. “We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts.” Brin goes on to recommend that Google’s AI teams work longer hours (“60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity”), come into the office “at least every week day,” prioritize “simple solutions” to problems, and generally move faster (“can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python”). What stuck out the most to me was his last point: that Google’s AI products “are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds.” According to Brin, Google needs to “trust our users” and “can’t keep building nanny products.” While his note was intended for a small audience of AI researchers at DeepMind and not all of Google, it’s still remarkable in a couple of ways. For one, it came from Brin, who technically has no formal role these days besides being a board member, and not Demis Hassabis, who runs Google DeepMind. As some employees have poined out to me, there’s also irony in Brin recommending that employees work 12-hour days when he and cofounder Larry Page arguably left Google rudderless when they retired in 2019 — just before this AI boom cycle began in earnest. Finally, it’s telling that Brin, who attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration with CEO Sundar Pichai, is now using his power to seemingly push for removing Gemini’s guardrails. You can read Brin’s full note to Gemini researchers below: “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM. We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts. Code matters most — AGI will happen with takeoff, when the Al improves itself. Probably initially it will be with a lot of human help so the most important is our code performance. Furthermore this needs to work on our own 1p code. We have to be the most efficient coder and Al scientists in the world by using our own Al. Productivity — In my experience about 60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity. Some folks put in a lot more but can burn out or lose creativity. A number of folks work less than 60 hours and a small number put in the bare minimum to get by. This last group is not only unproductive but also can be highly demoralizing to everyone else. Location — It is important to work in the office because physically being together is far more effective for communication than gve etc. And, therefore you need to be physically colocated with others working on the same thing. We need to minimize reporting lines across countries, cities, and buildings. I recommend being in the office at least every week day. Organization — We need to have clear responsibility and organization with high functioning groups with shared management and technology leadership. Simplicity — Lets use simple solutions where we can. Eg if prompting works, just do that, don’t posttrain a separate model. No unnecessary technical complexities (such as lora). Ideally we will truly have one recipe and one model which can simply be prompted for different uses. Excellence — whether it’s an eval or a data source or a dashboard or a message in an internal Ul, please make sure they all work and all are good. Speed — we need our products, models, internal tools to be fast. Can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python on borg. Iterate at small scale — we need lots of ideas that we can test quickly. The best way to do this is small scale experiments until you can ramp up and hopefully see increasing advantage at scale. This is an excellent validation. Working too much at just large scale has a habit of minor tweaking and overfitting to evals, checkpoint sniping, etc. We need real wins that scale. No punting — we can’t keep building nanny products. Our products are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds. We need capable products and [to] trust our users.“ By now, most employees at Meta have probably seen my story about the company firing around 20 employees for leaking. (A special thanks to the communications team for widely sharing it on Workplace!) Cracking down on leaks is nothing new for Meta, though leadership does seem highly motivated to snuff out this recent wave. Moments after my story was published yesterday, CTO Andrew Bosworth addressed the firings during a company all-hands meeting that was, yes, leaked to me. After joking about how chairs had been rearranged in the room to make the all-hands look more well attended than it actually was, here’s what he had to say about leaks: “There are three different types of leaks. A lot of times there are accidental leaks, people who are just being casual [and] clumsy with information. They’re trying to share it to a friend, a housemate, their mom, and they’re not paying attention to what they’re doing. The second kind is people who are trying to be helpful. ‘If only the press understood this one thing, then they would surely tell a good story about us.’ They won’t. And then there’s malicious leaks, antagonistic leaks, people who are trying to push an agenda that they hold and they think is more important to them than the company. All three of those leaks are fireable offenses. All three of them. And we take them seriously. We have a team dedicated to identifying these leaks. And so we did conduct a bunch of investigations and we fired more than 20 people for leaking in the last couple of weeks. More than 20. That’s not the entirety of the list. There’s quite a few more investigations that are proceeding right now. So, just to remind everybody, don’t be screenshotting stuff, don’t be recording stuff. We are getting pretty good at finding these things and those people aren’t here anymore… We just have zero tolerance. It doesn’t matter what the excuse is. It doesn’t matter how innocuous you think it was. We just fire those people. Okay. Great. Fun. Boy, we’re really off to a great roll. Nobody’s here. We fired people… And they wonder why they gave me the Q&A.” If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line and all of our reporting.

Title: There Are No More Redlines
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/jeff-bezos-great-emboldening/681886/

Welcome to the Great Emboldening. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. When Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post almost 12 years ago, he went out of his way to assuage fears that he would turn the paper into his personal mouthpiece. “The values of The Post do not need changing,” he wrote at the time. “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.” For much of his tenure, Bezos kept that promise. On Wednesday, he betrayed it. In a statement posted on X, Bezos announced an overhaul of the Post’s opinion section, expressly limiting the ideology of the department and its writers: “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” In response, the Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, resigned. This is the second time in the past six months that Bezos has meddled in the editorial processes of the paper—and specifically its opinion page. In October, Bezos intervened to shut down the Post’s presidential-endorsement process, suggesting that the ritual was meaningless and would only create the perception of bias. Many criticized his decision as a capitulation to Donald Trump, though Bezos denied those claims. Several editorial-board members resigned in protest, and more than 250,000 people canceled their subscription to the paper in the immediate aftermath. Some interpreted this week’s announcement similarly, saying that the Amazon founder is bending the knee to the current administration; the Post’s former editor in chief, Marty Baron, told The Daily Beast that “there is no doubt in my mind that he is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests.” Bezos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chuck Todd: Jeff Bezos is blaming the victim Whatever Bezos’s personal reasons are, equally important is the fact that he is emboldened to interfere so brazenly. And he’s not alone. A broader change has been under way among the tech and political elite over the past year or so. Whether it’s Bezos remaking a major national paper in his image or Elon Musk tearing out the guts of the federal government with DOGE, bosses of all stripes are publicly and unapologetically disposing of societal norms and seizing control of institutions to orient the world around themselves. Welcome to the Great Emboldening, where ideas and actions that might have been unthinkable, objectionable, or reputationally risky in the past are now on the table. This dynamic has echoes of the first Trump administration. Trump’s political rise offered a salient lesson that shamelessness can be a superpower in a political era when attention is often the most precious resource. Trump demonstrated that distorting the truth and generating outrage result in a lot of attentional value: When caught in a lie, he doubled down, denied, and went on the offensive. As a result, he made the job of demanding accountability much harder. Scandals that might otherwise have been ruinous—the Access Hollywood tape, for example—were spun as baseless attacks from enemies. Trump commandeered the phrase fake news from the media and then turned it against journalists when they reported on his lies. These tactics were successful enough that they spawned a generation of copycats: Unscrupulous politicians and business leaders in places such as Silicon Valley now had a playbook to use against their critics and, following Trump’s election, a movement to back it. Wittingly or not, nobody embodied this behavior better than Musk, who has spent the past decade operating with a healthy contempt for institutions, any semblance of decorum, and the law. Read: The flattening machine Trump’s first term was chaotic and run like a reality-television show; as a policy maker, he was largely ineffectual, instead governing via late-night tweets, outlandish press conferences, and a revolving door of hirings, fallings-out, and firings. But it wasn’t until the 2020 election and the events leading up to January 6 that Trump truly attempted to subvert American democracy to retain power. Although he was briefly exiled from major social-media channels, Trump got away with it: The narrative around January 6 was warped by Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters, and he continued to lead the Republican Party. This, along with the success of Trump’s 2024 campaign—which was rooted in the promise of exercising extreme executive authority—was a signal to powerful individuals, including many technology executives and investors, that they could act however they pleased. Read: The internet is worse than a brainwashing machine Trump winning the popular vote in November only amplified this dynamic. CEOs including Mark Zuckerberg pledged to roll back past content-moderation reforms and corporate-inclusivity initiatives, viewed now as excesses of the coronavirus-pandemic emergency and an outdated regime of overreach. Bosses in Silicon Valley, who saw the social-justice initiatives and worker solidarity of the COVID crisis as a kind of mutiny, felt emboldened and sought to regain control over their workforce, including by requiring people to return to the office. Tech executives professed that they were no longer afraid to speak their mind. On X, the Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia (who now works for Musk’s DOGE initiative) described the late 2010s and the Joe Biden era as “a time of silence, shaming, and fear.” That people like Gebbia—former liberals who used to fall in line with the politics of their peers—are now supporting Trump, the entrepreneur wrote, is part of a broader “woke-up call.” The Great Emboldening has taken many forms. At the Los Angeles Times, the billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong paved the way for Bezos, spiking a Kamala Harris endorsement and pledging to restore ideological balance to the paper by hiring right-wing columnists and experimenting with building a “bias meter” to measure opinions in the paper’s news stories. For some far-right influencers, this supposed MAGA cultural shift offers little more than the ability to offend with no consequences. “It’s okay to say retard again. And that’s great,” one right-wing X personality posted in December. Musk and others, including Steve Bannon, have taken this a step further, making what appear to be Nazi salutes while mocking anyone in the media who calls them out. The DOGE incursion into the federal government is the single best example of the emboldening at work—a premeditated plan to remake the federal government by seizing control of its information and terrorizing its workforce with firings and bureaucratic confusion. It is a barely veiled show of strength that revolves largely around the threat of mass layoffs. Some of DOGE’s exploits, as with a few of Trump’s executive orders, may not be legal, and some have been stopped by federal judges. As my colleagues and I have reported, some DOGE staffers have entered offices and accessed sensitive government data without the proper clearances and background checks, and have bypassed security protocols without concern. But the second Trump administration operates as though it is unconcerned with abiding by the standards and practices of the federal government. Bezos’s long-term plans for the Post beyond overhauling its opinion section aren’t yet known. But the timing of his decision to change the direction of its op-ed coverage tracks with the behavior of his peers, many of whom are adhering to the tenets of the Elon Musk school of management. When Bezos acquired The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013, its value to the tech baron was largely reputational. The purchase solidified Bezos as a mogul and, perhaps just as important, as a steward and benefactor of an important institution. Not meddling in the paper’s editorial affairs wasn’t just a strategy born out of the goodness of his heart; it was a way to exercise power through benevolence. Bezos could be seen as one of the good guys, shepherding an institution through the perils of an internet age that he profited handsomely from. Even if he stewed privately at the paper’s “Democracy dies in darkness” pivot in the first Trump administration, stepping in to influence coverage likely would have felt like too big a risk—an untenable mixing of Church and state. But the DOGE era offers a permission structure. In a moment of deep institutional distrust, Trump 2.0 has tried to make the case that anything goes and that previously unthinkable uses of executive power—such as, say, dismantling USAID—may be possible, if executed with enough shamelessness and bravado. Bezos may or may not be turning the Post’s opinion section into a state-media apparatus for Trump and his oligarch class. Either way, the pivot is a direct product of the second Trump era and mirrors the president’s own trajectory with the United States government. Become the figurehead of an institution. Try to control it by the old rules. When that doesn’t work, take it by force, break it down, and rebuild it in your image.

February 28, 2025 18:00 ET | Source: Kirby McInerney LLP Kirby McInerney LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of those who acquired Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:RKLB) securities during the period from November 12, 2024, through February 25, 2025 (“the Class Period”). Investors have until April 28, 2025, to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. [LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION] On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Rocket Lab’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, the price of Rocket Lab shares declined by $2.21 per share, from $22.49 per share on February 24, 2025, to close at $20.28 on February 25, 2025. The complaint alleges that defendants, throughout the Class Period, failed to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; and (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner.

Title: Markets wrap rough month driven by ‘Extreme Fear’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: US stocks seesawed Friday, but all three major indexes closed the month in the red — a sign of increasing unease in markets. Volatility gripped markets as traders closed out a dismal February that wiped out some gains. “Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday and for the fourth day in a row, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index. Stocks initially rose Friday morning, buoyed by cooling inflation data that provided relief for investors. Yet markets moved into the red midday following a very public heated exchange at the White House between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that stoked uncertainty around geopolitical stability. The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, popped to its highest level this year. In afternoon trading, markets recouped losses, and the major indexes surged higher to close out the day. The Dow ended the day up 601 points, or 1.39%, while the broader S&P 500 rose 1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.63%. Yet US markets sputtered in February and slid this week. The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1% this week and is down 1.4% this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.5% this week and 4% this month, its worth month since April 2024. “We believe there is valid concern in the markets about the amount of money being spent on Artificial Intelligence datacenters and capex, considering news from China AI startup DeepSeek in late January,” said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a Friday note. Tentarelli said uncertainty about AI spending coupled with concerns about economic growth has led many of the stocks leading the Nasdaq to underperform. The Nasdaq is heavily weighted toward tech and was driven higher last year by companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Palantir (PLTR). Yet those surging tech stocks have slowed down this month. Tesla shares are down about 26% over the past month. The reasons for the Nasdaq’s decline range from inflation risk to decelerating growth to its stocks having tough outlooks compared to other assets, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, in an email. “Concerns about potential economic growth deceleration may be fostering increased risk aversion, potentially leading investors to shift away from the more volatile Nasdaq index in favor of more stable investment options,” said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. Nvidia posted strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, though its stock’s high valuation raises the question of how much more room there is to run. Still, the broader market remains near its all-time high, reached just last week. And the bumpiness in the market isn’t all that unusual for this time of year. “The stock market’s recent declines are simply garden variety volatility, largely because February is historically a volatile month, and because we saw significant gains throughout January,” said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management. While new inflation data matched expectations, other economic data released Friday revealed cracks in the economy that contributed to weary investor sentiment: Consumer spending pulled back far more than economists expected in January and posted the biggest monthly decline since February 2021. “Investors will continue to focus on the uncertain growth trajectory as real spending unexpectedly fell in January from weaker consumer demand,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank’s estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 were also revised on Friday to project a decline of 1.5%, rather than growth of 2.3%. “This huge drop in the estimate reflects the very weak data that has been coming out on retail sales, net imports, inventories and new home sales,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email. Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said he is cautious about the market due to high valuations. At UBS, strategists advised preparing for volatility ahead, though considered the bull market intact. “We think the bull market is intact driven by healthy economic and profit growth, supportive Fed policy and AI spending/adoption,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Friday note. “But we have also cautioned that volatility would likely be higher this year due to policy uncertainty and trade frictions. Therefore, we have been highlighting that short-term hedges may be worth considering,” said Lefkowitz. CNN’s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Tariff threats and economic warning signs create corporate uncertainty America's CEOs and billionaires climbed on the Trump bandwagon during the 2024 presidential campaign. A month after the inauguration, some of them are looking to climb off. "CEO optimism is fading" as trade restrictions and mass government layoffs threaten the economy, said Semafor. The stock market has dropped since President Donald Trump took office, while both consumer confidence and consumer spending dropped in January. Trump's on-again-off-again tariff threats have made it impossible for business leaders to make plans. "You can't move a factory overnight," said ON Semiconductor CEO Hassane El-Khoury. That's why American business leaders are "turning on Trump — fast," said Semafor. It took just a month for the new administration to "cool the enthusiasm of chief executives and dealmakers," said The Wall Street Journal. The uncertain environment is making corporate leaders hesitant to pull the trigger on big deals. For that to turn around, "CEOs will need to find more comfort than they have today."

"There's a pretty clear sentiment in America's corporate world these days: anxiety," said Emily Stewart at Business Insider. Trump's reputation as a "loose cannon" may give him an advantage in some negotiations, but businesses find it "challenging to navigate." Businesses are "benefiting from plenty of Trump's actions" — the president halted enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials. But overall, corporate leaders are finding the new administration a "chaotic time," said Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy to Insider. There are "so many surprises that are happening on a weekly basis." "Don't expect corporations to save us from Trump," said Robert Kuttner at The American Prospect. It's only been a few weeks since Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Toyota, Apple's Tim Cook, and OpenAI chief Sam Altman all "donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration." Rebuilding democracy will require the efforts of regular people, not corporations, and the effort "requires containing both Trumpism and predatory capitalism." Not everybody is nervous. One measure of CEO confidence has "soared to its highest level in three years," said Newsweek. The Conference Board Measure of CEO Confidence "rose significantly" in 2025's first quarter. That's because executives "anticipate business-friendly policies from the new administration, including regulatory and tax changes." Brian Marks, executive director of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program at the University of New Haven, said the reading may be "premature." This early in the new administration is "too soon to fully assess the situation." Others are more downbeat. "There's more uncertainty than I think is widely appreciated," said Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute to The New York Times. The chaos unleashed by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is creating a "chilling effect on investment plans and expansion plans," Strain said. Even the president's allies are cautious. The economy is showing signs of "slower growth and higher inflation," said Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, a business adviser during the first Trump administration. "Not good."

Stocks were higher on Friday as President Trump’s latest announcement of new tariffs and China’s vow to retaliate heightened trade tensions. At around 12:40 PM in New York, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 added 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average popped by 0.2%. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge tracking consumer spending on goods and services, was released in the morning, showing a 2.6% annual inflation rate for January—matching estimates and signaling steady inflation. Here are stocks to watch today: Dell (DELL+3.48%) shares declined on Friday after the tech company posted better-than-expected earnings but reported revenue of $23.9 billion, falling short of the projected $24.55 billion. Investors are also concerned about the profitability of the firm’s server business. Monster Beverage (MNST+0.51%) stock gained on Friday after the drink company’s quarterly net sales topped analysts’ expectations, even as earnings per share fell short, Reuters reported. NetApp’s (NTAP+1.72%) shares fell in the afternoon as the company’s revenue missed consensus. AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA+0.85%) recovered in the morning following President Trump’s tariff plans and China’s vows to take retaliatory measures. Earlier this week, the chip giant surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, highlighting sustained demand fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Rocket Lab (RKLB+7.61%) stock plunged on Friday after the commercial space company posted fourth-quarter results that were in line with expectations but issued disappointing guidance and announced product delays. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.10%) shares fell, wiping out gains from earlier this week as the escalating tariff war and economic concerns weighed on the AI hardware maker.

Tech stocks aren’t feeling the love from investors this earnings cycle, with even Nvidia (NVDA+0.85%) set for a weekly decline despite releasing an upbeat forecast and last-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Dell’s (DELL+3.48%) stock fell on Friday after its profit topped forecasts, but investors chose to focus on a revenue miss and the narrow profitability of its server business. Autodesk (ADSK-0.70%) slumped after rising yesterday on an earnings beat and newly disclosed plans to lay off employees. HP Inc. (HPQ+1.08%) and NetApp (NTAP+1.72%) also slid after earnings. Palantir (PLTR+4.28%) and Super Micro (SMCI-1.10%) extended declines. “While fourth-quarter earnings have been generally positive, with more companies than average beating expectations, some of the commentary about 2025 has been more negative,” Michael Rosen, CIO of Angeles Investments, told Quartz. Weaker consumer spending, tariffs, and possible policy changes are creating uncertainty. Nvidia did give a positive outlook, but investors in Big Tech stocks are still getting more cautious amid the general anxiety, Rosen added. They’ve had an incredible run over the past two years — justified by rising profits — but they’re now broadening their focus, as shown by gains in European equities. Mike Treacy, Head of Market Risk at Apex Fintech Solutions, sees a more-technical explanation for the weakness in tech stocks. “We are seeing a massive unwind across multiple risk assets: AI, momentum stocks, crypto, etc.,” he told Quartz. “We are below the 200-day moving average in both SMH and NVDA. Despite robust earnings from NVDA, we could see technical selling across the AI ecosystem until these charts recover.” The days a single earnings report could cause a jump in Nvidia’s stock are probably over because the company has become so big in market value, said Explosive Options’ founder Bob Lang. “There was nothing wrong with the earnings,” Lang said in an interview. “It’s just become a megacap company, like Microsoft (MSFT+1.99%) before that and IBM (IBM-1.21%) even earlier. It’s unlikely to be better than a market performer, not a stock that fund managers can rely on to make a quarter.” It wasn’t all down-arrow on Friday: Nvidia is trading up on the day.

Title: Nvidia's stock slide kicked its market cap out of the $3 trillion club

Despite delivering another record quarter, Nvidia (NVDA+0.85%) fell out of the $3 trillion market cap club after some unimpressed investors were left wanting more. Nvidia’s stock was up by around 1.4% during morning trading on Friday at around $121 per share, leaving the firm with a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap. Still, the chipmaker’s shares fell in early trading on Thursday after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.15%), Intel (INTC-4.43%), and other chip rivals also saw declining shares. “What seems to be driving the share reaction is that it’s yet another typical Nvidia report where they beat and raise expectations,” Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. “For them to have this track record of doing that every time, in some way almost works against them as the market is not impressed unless it is a blowout beat and raise.” The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Its full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Nvidia’s fine! Besides, who else is going to power all these new AI models?

UPDATED 10:53 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Nvidia came through on earnings this week, with little sign of slowing growth, but investors apparently didn’t like the lower gross margin and knocked shares down more than 8% Thursday. It almost counts as a win given the sky-high expectations. It was a mixed bag for other enterprise tech providers too, as whatever AI-driven boost they’re getting, enterprise customers are not yet spending enough to swing the needle. Snowflake, Workday and Nutanix surged, but not so much Dell, NetApp, HP, Pure Storage and Salesforce (which said its highly touted Agentforce services won’t contribute much to earnings until 2026). As theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante and George Gibert have noted, a better data stack needs to arrive before agents can take off. AI uh-oh? Microsoft scrapped some data center leases, though it seems far from a stampede away from AI infra spending just yet, especially with Apple and Alibaba doubling down. Meta, in fact, is looking at spending $200 billion on a single AI data center. Plus, the demanding new AI models keep on coming, this week alone from OpenAI, Tencent, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Anthropic and more. Indeed, IBM is getting busier with AI, buying DataStax and debuting new Granite AI models. On the cloud front, it also just closed its $6.4 billion HashiCorp acquisition. No wonder CEO Arvind Krishna was bullish last month. Amazon finally upped the ante on AI with Alexa+, to pretty good reviews. Dell aims to help telecom providers finally move to the cloud and its shares got a one-day boost as a result. DOGE looks more and more like ransomware, says security expert Bruce Schneier.

Hollywood Life Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News NewsExpand Menu EntertainmentExpand Menu BeautyExpand Menu FashionExpand Menu ShoppingExpand Menu TrendingExpand Menu Celebrity BiosExpand Menu A grassroots group called for a nationwide boycott of shopping at major retail chains. Learn how to participate here. Find Out A new movement is sweeping the nation on February 28, 2025, calling for a mass boycott of shopping at major retailers. The day — known online as “Blackout Friday” or the “economic blackout” — encourages Americans to avoid buying anything nonessential, such as fast food. In order to participate, people can purchase items from local and small businesses. Learn more about the February 28 economic blackout and how to participate below. The nationwide blackout is a movement that Americans can choose to participate in; it’s not a formal holiday nor an order by anyone in the government. Contrary to what critics assumed, the grassroots group known as The People’s Union USA clarified that the blackout is not associated with any political party. According to The People’s Union USA’s website, the group is “dedicated to economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.” “We are NOT a political party, we are a movement for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, religion, or political affiliation,” the website indicates. “Our goal is to unite Americans against the corruption and greed that has kept us struggling for decades.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) Behind The People’s Union USA is its founder, John Schwarz. According to its site, the group emphasizes that it stands “firmly for equality and freedom for ALL people, regardless of race, gender, background, or identity.” “The idea that companies and institutions should abandon diversity and inclusivity is regressive and unacceptable,” the group notes on its site, referring to the removal of DEI programs by major companies after Donald Trump‘s layoffs of federal DEI workers. “Every American deserves an equal chance at success, and we will not support policies that encourage discrimination or exclusion.” The People’s Union USA also indicates that it is not fighting against “one person,” such as Trump or Elon Musk. “This movement] is about the system as a whole,” the group emphasizes. “Both political parties, both past and current leaders, and billionaires have manipulated the economy and profited off the working class. We will hold them all accountable. Our focus is systemic change, not political drama.” A post shared by John Schwarz (@theonecalledjai) The February 28, 2025, economic blackout calls for consumers to avoid buying gas, fast food and/or buying anything online or in stores at the biggest retail chains. You can participate in the blackout — which is only the first of several others that The People’s Union USA has planned — by avoiding purchases at major corporations and retailers, such as Target and Amazon. If participants do need to make purchases, though, they are encouraged to only shop at local and small businesses. Items needed for medical purposes or emergencies can still be purchased. The February 28, 2025, economic blackout will end at midnight on March 1, 2025. The next blackout is scheduled to take place on March 28, 2025, and the third is set for April 18, 2025, according to The People’s Union USA. In March, there is a planned week-long blackout against Amazon; there is also one in April against Walmart. Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect

Time Published: 2025-02-28T13:29:03Z
Full Content:
The platform, a 400-foot (122-meter) repurposed barge, will be outfitted with autonomous ground support systems to capture and secure the returning Neutron rocket. Other enhancements will include blast shielding to safeguard onboard equipment during landings and station-keeping thrusters for precise positioning at sea. Rocket Lab has acquired the barge, with modifications expected to continue through 2025, leading to operational deployment in 2026. Neutron, Rocket Lab's reusable carbon composite medium-lift launch vehicle, is designed to support a range of missions, including single and multi-satellite deployments, national security operations, and interplanetary cargo transport. With a payload capacity of up to 33,000 pounds (15,000 kg), Neutron is being developed at a rapid pace, leveraging Rocket Lab's expertise as a high-frequency launch provider. The rocket can execute two reusable landing profiles based on mission parameters. For certain missions, Neutron will return to Rocket Lab Launch Complex 3 in Virginia for a propulsive landing. Alternatively, for missions requiring maximum payload performance, the rocket will execute a Down Range Landing (DRL) maneuver, touching down on the 'Return On Investment' ocean platform. Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, emphasized the urgency behind Neutron's development, stating, We're working hard to bring Neutron online with one of the fastest development schedules in history for a new rocket, because we know medium-lift launch opportunities are limited and space access is being stifled. Neutron's debut launch planned for later this year will help to ease that bottleneck, and our new landing platform will open space access even further by enabling even more mission opportunities that require maximum Neutron performance. Rocket Lab plans for Neutron's inaugural launch from Virginia in the latter half of 2025.

The agreement builds upon a previous multi-launch contract signed in 2024, bringing iQPS' total reserved Electron missions to eight. Under these agreements, six launches are scheduled for 2025 and two in 2026. This follows the successful deployment of iQPS's QPS-SAR-5 satellite, "TSUKUYOMI-I," via an Electron rocket in December 2023. The deal represents one of the largest Electron launch contracts to date, second only to Rocket Lab's ten-launch agreement with Japanese satellite operator Synspective. Each of these launches will contribute to the development of iQPS' planned constellation of 36 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites. These satellites are designed to provide high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities regardless of time of day or weather conditions, delivering near real-time observation data globally. With exclusive use of each Electron mission, iQPS gains precise control over launch schedules, orbital parameters, and mission specifications, optimizing deployment for its growing satellite network. Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the importance of tailored launch solutions for constellation operators. Electron's strength lies in its ability to provide precise constellation deployment on a customized timeline. Accurate orbital positioning is crucial for Earth imaging missions, and the demand for this capability is reflected in our growing number of multi-launch contracts with returning customers like iQPS. We are honored to once again support iQPS in achieving its mission. Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, expressed enthusiasm for the partnership: We are thrilled to expand our collaboration with Rocket Lab, securing additional dedicated Electron launches. Electron's high-frequency launch capability and reliability make it an excellent choice for our growing satellite constellation. This agreement is a significant milestone in our commitment to realizing our vision over the next two years. The next Electron mission for iQPS is set for launch as early as March 2025, with additional details to be released closer to the launch date.

Title: Big Tech wants everyone to use AI, just not when applying for jobs

Happy Friday! What do Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King have in common? They are part of the first all-women space crew since 1963. Sánchez is leading the six-person crew on an 11-minute journey on one of her fiancé Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rockets. In today's big story, Amazon's love affair with AI doesn't extend to job candidates using it during interviews. What's on deck Markets: Goldman Sachs pulls back on DEI language in its annual report. It says it's just following the law. Tech: Internal xAI documents show how workers are instructed to suss out "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in Elon Musk's chatbot. Business: Netflix isn't losing sleep over your canceled subscription. In fact, you'll probably be back. But first, AI for me, but not for interviewees. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tech companies love AI. Just don't try to use it to get a job at one. Amazon created guidelines for its internal recruiters to sniff out job candidates who might be using AI during the hiring process, writes Business Insider's Eugene Kim. The tech giant's stance is that AI tools give candidates an "unfair advantage" that doesn't allow Amazon to evaluate their "authentic" skills, according to guidelines Eugene obtained. As a reminder, this is the same Amazon pouring billions of dollars into AI development in the hopes that AI tools become a key part of people's personal and professional lives. The same Amazon encouraging employees to use its AI chatbot at work. The same Amazon that would love to have its AI-powered Alexa+ in homes across America. With all that AI encouragement, it's not surprising candidates would turn to these tools to give themselves the best chance possible, especially when the market for tech jobs is so tough. Dealing with AI-powered interviewees isn't just an Amazon problem. For about as long as AI chatbots have been around, people have been figuring out how to use them to cheat get an advantage. BI's Rob Price has covered the topic extensively, writing about the "magic teleprompter" apps that feed candidates answers. Sometimes, using AI is just about passing a technical test to get a raise or to land a job. Other times, the tools are shadow stand-ins for people, doing some, if not all, of their actual work. While the latter might sound egregious, using AI tools to get a job that'll require you to use AI tools doesn't seem that out of line. Imagine if you had to try out for a track team but weren't allowed to wear running shoes. Why ban someone from using something they'll eventually need to succeed? I put that question to a tech recruiter. They said the problem is candidates solely relying on AI tools instead of having their own logic and general knowledge. It's a big issue, particularly with younger candidates fresh out of college, they added. Still, it's not like candidates haven't been trying to get an edge on interviews for years. The recruiter mentioned the 2008 book "Cracking the Coding Interview," which includes programming questions commonly asked during interviews. Sometimes, the recruiter has to stay a step ahead, like asking follow-up questions the chatbots might have trouble managing. And if all else fails, maybe AI can help with the AI problem. 1. Meet the fund manager who beats the S&P 500 again and again. Michael Cuggino's Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500, returning 28% versus the index's 17% on a trailing 12-month basis. Cuggino's fund also had a higher average annual gain than the S&P 500 over the past decade. The secret? The fund doesn't invest along themes or focus too much on specific indexes, instead prioritizing quality growth firms. 2. Nvidia still has something to prove. Despite strong earnings, one subject came up a bunch during Nvidia's Wednesday call: gross margins. CFO Colette Kress said expectations are in the "low 70s" for the current quarter as the company ramps up Blackwell chip production. Still, she thinks the gross margins will bounce back after. Even once Nvidia isn't as stressed over speeding up Blackwell, one analyst doesn't think the chip titan will be out of the woods. 3. Goldman wants to play by the rules as it drops DEI references. The bank toned down DEI language in its annual report, mentioning diversity much less than in previous years. The bank also said its "aspirational hiring goals" will expire this year without clarifying if new ones will be implemented. Goldman CEO David Solomon said the bank made the adjustments "to reflect developments in the law in the US." 1. xAI is training Grok in anti-wokeness. BI reviewed internal xAI documents outlining how AI tutors should "spot bias" and look out for "woke ideology" and "cancel culture" in its chatbot Grok's responses. Tutors are told to consider the company's "guiding principles," which include "do not moralize, preach, or judge." Some workers said they felt the training methods prioritize right-wing beliefs, while a researcher said he believes Grok's approach can differentiate it from other chatbots. Check out some of the sample prompts and responses tutors were shown. 2. Googlers are using a Google Doc to track Google's layoffs. The tech giant cut jobs across its Cloud, ads, and Trust & Safety teams this week. It follows smaller, surgical cuts across the company over the past few months, employees said. In an effort to track the layoffs, current employees have circulated a crowdsourced Google Doc reviewed by BI. 3. An origin story for Amazon's robots revolutionalizing e-commerce. In 2015, Amazon hosted a competition challenging researchers to build robots that could identify and pick up specific warehouse items. A decade later, those ideas have helped launch a flock of advanced robots that could help the e-commerce giant save as much as $10 billion a year. 1. Rise of the Gen Z realtors. The share of realtors under 30 quadrupled in 2024, data shows, as the profession attracts more young people. Three Gen Z brokers told BI the profession helped them experience financial freedom and avoid slogging away at a typical desk job — even if their baby faces made it hard to get off the ground initially. 2. I just can't quit you, Netflix. The streaming giant isn't worried if you cancel your subscription — data from the analytics company Antenna suggests it'll probably win you back quickly. In 2023, 61% of subscribers who canceled were back on the platform within a year. That win-back rate far surpasses Netflix's streaming rivals' average of 45%. 3. These healthcare startups are ready for acquisitions this year. It's been a slow few years for company combinations in the healthcare startup industry. Nearly a dozen investors and bankers told BI few large companies seem willing to make big deals. The right buyers might be their peers — and seven healthcare startups appear ready to move.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set.

Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR.

Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR.

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India Sources familiar with the matter stated that Logically, the British fact-checking company, has laid off approximately 8-10 individuals from its India team as part of its company-wide efforts. This is part of a larger global restructuring, with dozens of employees laid off as part of cost-cutting measures. Logically India’s spokesperson confirmed the development. In a statement to MediaNama, they stated: “At Logically, we continuously assess our business to ensure we are best positioned for long-term success in delivering on our mission to combat threats online. With recent new additions to our C-Suite and a transition to being a more product-led business, we have reflected on our company strategy, needs, and organisational structure and made the decision to streamline our operations globally across multiple areas of the business.” The statement added that this decision does not relate to any editorial realignment. “This decision was not taken lightly, and we are deeply grateful for the contributions of our departing colleagues,” it added. The company has operations in the UK, the US, and India and announced layoffs earlier this month, which impacted around 40 employees. The fact-checker’s investors include the Amazon Alexa Fund and Vitruvian Partners. The company also secured multi-million-pound government contracts to counter conspiracy theories and false health information online. This follows Meta’s new policy, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in January, which loosened restrictions on political speech and moved away from third-party fact-checking. Specifically, the platform intended to weaken restrictions on sensitive topics like immigration, gender, and gender identity, lift limits on political content, and adopt a community-driven fact-checking system similar to X (formerly Twitter). In India, the crowdsourced ‘Community Notes’ system has also raised concerns among local fact-checkers about their future, despite assurances that international partnerships will remain intact for now.

Title: Investors Are Making Big AI-Based Sentiment Bets

ByHersh Shefrin ByHersh Shefrin , Contributor. INDIA - 2023/02/17: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon is seen displayed on a mobile ... [+] phone screen with AI (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) There are indications that AI-enthusiasm is leading current stock market valuations to be driven by sentiment, the psychological biases of excessive optimism and overconfidence, rather than by fundamentals. Overvaluation bias increases the risk that companies will adopt big unprofitable investment projects. There are two separate issues discussed below which interrelate, namely capital investment and market valuation. Four of the largest U.S. companies engaged in AI have announced plans to increase their capital investment by 45%, a testament to their great optimism for the technology. The four companies are Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. Of these, Amazon’s share of the planned increase in Capex is the largest, at almost one third. At the same time, U.S. stocks have held fairly steady, although the S&P 500 has declined by about 3% since the January 20 inauguration of President Trump. The traditional view is that a corporate decision creates fundamental value if the net present value of the associated cash flow stream is positive, or technically at least zero. Notice that this statement applies to fundamental value, but not necessarily to market valuations. Consequently, it is critical to distinguish between the two concepts of value, and to recognize when market valuations differ dramatically from corresponding fundamental values. In the presence of gaps between market valuations and fundamental values, there is mispricing risk to be borne, in addition to fundamental risk. During the dot.com bubble, mispricing-risk was high. Overvaluation led to many capital investments being funded that featured negative NPVs and then subsequent failures when the bubble burst. Investors would do well to keep this history in mind when making AI-based capital investments in the current environment. The NPV of a capital investment is the amount by which the investment changes the fundamental value of the company. The fundamental value of the company as a whole is based on the amount of cash a company generates over time, which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. This cash flow is called the company’s free cash flow. The fundamental value of the company’s stock is determined by the portion of the free cash flows available to be paid just to the shareholders. The case of Amazon provides a good vehicle for assessing the degree to which stock prices reflect psychological biases rather than underlying fundamentals. Elsewhere, I have written about similarities between Amazon and the other three companies mentioned above. A minority of sell-side analysts use free cash flow analysis to value Amazon’s stocks. Analysts at the former Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, are among this minority. The history of their past reports, as well as their recent reports, provides important insights into the degree to which Amazon’s current stock market valuation accurately reflects fundamentals. I should note that I reached out to both Amazon and UBS for comments on this post, but did not receive replies. On February 27, 2025, Amazon’s stock price closed at just under $210. The analyst team at UBS following Amazon set a target price of $230 for the stock. In October 2019, the team with the same lead analyst, Stephen Ju, established 2025 as the terminal year of their free cash flow analysis. In doing so, they divided their valuation number for Amazon’s stock into two components, one for the five-year period 2020 through 2024, and the other for 2025 and thereafter. A point very important for readers to understand is that for Amazon’s stock, in 2019 the analyst team assigned about 80% of the stock’s value to the period beginning in 2025. As a result, it is long-term issues that mostly drive the fundamental value of Amazon’s stock, not the short-term, day-to-day fluctuations upon which investors mostly focus. The significance of the long-term approach provides the reason why discussions about Capex are critical, as these expenditures significantly impact long-term free cash flows. Market psychology determines the degree to which the stock market is rational. Psychology impacts analysts’ estimates of free cash flows and it impacts investors’ reactions to market events. In a rational world, if analysts’ forecasts of future free cash flows turn out be reasonably accurate, then there is reason to judge that their valuation estimates would be relatively unbiased. Consider two questions. In October 2019, how accurate was the UBS analyst team in forecasting Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024? How accurate was the team in forecasting what Amazon’s market capitalization would be at the beginning of 2025? Based on my analysis of the UBS analyst report and Amazon’s financial statements, it appears that the UBS team significantly overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024. In this respect, the Covid pandemic might have been a contributing factor. That said, the ratio of the average annual free cash flow forecast to its actual value was four, an optimistic bias of 300%. This implies that had the analyst team used the actual free cash flow values for their 2019 valuation computation, their target price would have been 25% of the figure in their October 2019 report. The analyst team’s calculations from 2019 provide an estimate of what the value of Amazon’s stock would be at the beginning of 2025. The ratio of the actual value to the estimated value is 1.63, which means that the current market value of Amazon’s stock is 63% higher than what the analyst calculations from 2019 implied. Juxtapose the answers to the two questions. The UBS team severely overestimated by 300% Amazon’s free cash flows, and intrinsic value, during the period 2020 through 2024; and yet in 2025 Amazon’s stock price is 63% above UBS’ valuation estimate from 2019. In a rational market, this would be very surprising. However, the evidence suggests that the market is far from rational, and this is the point. An important reason why the analyst team overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period beginning in 2020 is that they underestimated Amazon’s Capex. This, they did, to the point of assuming that Amazon’s property, plant, and equipment would decline from one year to the next, eventually approaching zero. The assumption of declining PP&E is unrealistic for a company like Amazon, and has no precedent in Amazon’s history. It stands completely opposite to Amazon’s stated investment policy at the time, and certainly to Amazon’s massive planned investment described above. Why the analyst team would make such an assumption is a matter of speculation. One thing to keep in mind is that for a given level of cash flow from operations, lower Capex implies higher free cash flows. Therefore, lower Capex, all else being the same, leads to a higher valuation. If the analyst team was looking for a way to construct the numbers to produce a higher valuation, this was a way to do it. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the balance sheet the analyst team presents in their 2019 report omits values for the line item PP&E. Indeed, it is the only line item in the balance sheet with blank entries. Therefore, investors interested in the analyst team’s forecast for PP&E would have to compute the numbers themselves, which is what I did. Looked at this way, when developing their target prices, analysts can use upwardly biased estimates of free cash flow as a back door, nontransparent technique to capture irrational exuberance. It is just that in 2019, the Credit Suisse/UBS team were too light on the magnitude of this bias. For the record, consider the following fact. Suppose that in 2019, the analyst team used the actual figures for free cash flows to forecast the intrinsic value of Amazon stock at the outset of 2025. Then they would have arrived at a figure that is one ninth of Amazon’s actual market cap. In other words, had the team used estimates close to realized Amazon free cash flows, instead of what they actually used, it would have undershot Amazon’s 2025 market cap by almost an order of magnitude instead of by 63%. The difference between Amazon’s market cap and the estimate of fundamental value based on actual free cash flows is important. This difference is an indication of just how much bias there is in current market valuations for tech stocks, especially for companies making large AI-related capital expenditures. In 2017, the prices of technology stocks began to increase dramatically, reflecting a discernable change in investor excitement about technology. That year Greg Ip, now the chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal, created a video entitled “The Economy Needs More Amazons.” The website description of the video states the following: “The U.S. has observed a long period of low stock-market volatility and economic stagnation. The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip believes the economy and markets could benefit from more risk-taking companies - creative disrupters like Amazon.com.” Amazon is a good company. For psychological reasons, investors exhibit a behavior pattern known as representativeness bias by assuming that good stocks are stocks of good companies. However, irrational exuberance can leads stocks of good companies to be bad stocks. Over the last five years, Amazon has been a good stock, returning 17% per year on average. Now 17% is well above Amazon’s required return on equity which was close to 10.5%, based on the analyst team’s October 2019 report. The point to keep in mind is that this return was not been generated by Amazon’s free cash flows, the basis of its fundamental value. Instead, it was generated by investor sentiment, the biased response to underlying fundamentals. Remember that the analyst team severely underestimated the rise in price of Amazon’s stock, even as it simultaneously overestimated Amazon’s free cash flow stream. Investing in stocks like Amazon involves bets on future sentiment as well as fundamentals. In a world of very high expectations for AI, and large capital expenditures in developing this technology, investors would do well to understand the extent to which they are relying on sustained and growing optimism to generate attractive returns. Analysts, investors, and corporate executives should be paying attention to the differences between market caps and corresponding estimates of fundamental value. However, there appears to be little evidence of them doing so.

Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Broadcom’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. • Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2/27/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

My favourite travel charger. All time low, 62% off RRP$79.95 65W. was $34 ?? That Deal was $34 "57% off RRP$79.95 65W." Now $30 "62% off RRP$79.95 65W" so 12% off Officeworks' normal price when they stocked it i.e. % off RRP is not too meaningful (not that it often is) % off next cheapest alternative or usual price is better comparison Ozbargainers never trust RRP😉 But cheaper than last Deal with 5k clicks. @INFIDEL: actually OW might have some stock to price-beat :) https://officeworks.youinstock.com.au/search/OWPWW14020 @tonester: 16 showing in whole of Oz!!

This is the second-best February performance in a decade. While overall growth is moderate, the market remains stable. February being a shorter month also impacted the sales data. Mumbai’s property market is well positioned for long-term stability and growth. Large-scale infrastructure projects and a redevelopment boom, coupled with a strong economic outlook, are boosting the market. The broader outlook for the real estate sector remains resilient. The full impact of the RBI rate cut, tax cuts in the budget, and liquidity measures announced by the RBI is expected to provide much-needed support by increasing affordability for buyers, ensuring market stability is maintained. We continue to believe that the demand for homes developed by reputed developers in township and gated communities will command a premium and renewed demand.” Post Covid Nifty has seen 14-15% PE or Price compression.

The latest government data reveals that over 11,300 homes were sold in Mumbai in February 2025. This translates to over 400 units sold per day, a phenomenal achievement. This is positive news for the real estate sector, indicating a growing interest in homes in the city. We expect the positive trend to continue and witness an upward trajectory. Firstly, the full impact of RBI’s rate cut and measures announced in the Union Budget will be seen in the months to come. Developers offering various lucrative schemes and incentives to attract buyers will boost sales. Additionally, there is a demand for both premium and mid-end categories, particularly in emerging micro-markets. The heightened traction in the redevelopment will increase inventory and a wider choice for homebuyers. We expect the broader economic recovery to benefit the housing industry Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (ACMIIL) presents the latest January 2025 Credit Card Market Report, offering a deep dive into spending trends, card issuance patterns, and competitive market dynamics. Key Market Insights: 1. Credit Card Spending Shows Seasonal Decline but Strong YoY Growth Total credit card spending stood at ₹1.8 trillion, reflecting a 2% month-on-month (MoM) decline but a robust 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth. The MoM decline is attributed to a high base effect from December 2024, when festive and holiday-related spending boosted transaction volumes. The average spend per card dipped 1% MoM to ₹16,911, while the average spend per transaction declined 1% MoM and 15% YoY to ₹4,282, indicating evolving consumer behaviour and macroeconomic adjustments. 2. Credit Card Transactions & Issuance Witness a Slowdown Total transaction volume reached 430 million, a 1% MoM decline but still 31% higher YoY. However, this marks the slowest YoY growth since March 2024, reflecting cautious consumer spending. The number of outstanding credit cards declined to 109 million, down from 110 million in December 2024. 1.2 million cards were withdrawn in January, possibly due to tightening credit norms and increased delinquencies. 3. Market Leaders Continue to Strengthen Their Positions HDFC Bank, SBI, and ICICI Bank remain dominant players, collectively maintaining a significant share of the credit card market. HDFC Bank’s market share increased from 20.2% to 21.5% YoY, reflecting strong customer acquisition efforts. SBI recovered from a temporary dip, increasing its share to 18.8%, with 2.4 lakh new cards issued in January. ICICI Bank also regained ground, rising from 16.3% to 16.6% YoY. 4. Midcap and Small-Cap Banks Show Mixed Performance Yes Bank’s market share has remained stagnant at 2.2% since September 2024, signaling a slowdown in its previous aggressive expansion strategy. IDFC First Bank emerged as an outperformer, increasing its market share from 2.4% to 3.1% YoY through an aggressive push in credit card issuance. 5. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Credit Card Embargo Lifted A significant regulatory development in February 2025: The RBI lifted Kotak Mahindra Bank’s 10-month embargo on credit card issuance. This move is expected to help Kotak regain lost market share, which had slipped to 4.6% YoY. The bank’s re-entry is poised to impact competitive market dynamics in the coming months. 6. Disbursement Growth Hits a 4-Year Low The slowdown in credit card disbursement is at a 4-year low, signaling cautious lending practices by banks amid concerns over rising delinquencies and economic uncertainty. The total market share of the top 10 banks remains strong at 92%, showing continued consolidation in the industry. Conclusion & Market Outlook The credit card industry continues to experience strong annual growth, but short-term headwinds remain due to seasonal fluctuations, tightened credit policies, and evolving consumer behavior. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s re-entry and shifts in market share among key players are expected to be key themes in the months ahead. For detailed insights or expert commentary, please feel free to reach out Since the operationalisation of Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), 1.19 lakh projects, comprising 97.14 lakh units, have been registered with top 10 State RERAs between 2017-2024, said a report by NSE-listed data analytics firm PropEquity. The top ten States with the highest number of projects registered with their respective RERAs are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Maharashtra with 48,047 registered projects accounts for 40% of the total registered projects in top 10 states. Tamil Nadu with 19987 projects accounts for 17% share while Gujarat with 16,265 projects accounts for 14% share. Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO, PropEquity said: “Due to RERA, there has been a vast improvement in compliance by real estate developers as a result of which the sector has seen huge transparency. This has led to a rise in investment by individual investors, and both domestic and foreign institutional investors thereby further espousing not just India’s but also real estate sector’s growth story.” “The real estate market across 9 top Tier 1 cities are today valued at over Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Unlike the pre-RERA years, absorption every year, post RERA implementation, has been more than launches (except covid year CY 2020), which shows the maturity that this regulation has ushered amongst developers thereby laying a strong foundation for a $1 trillion real estate economy.” “The government must look to align strong regulations and compliance with favourable tax policies for both developers and homebuyers in order to achieve this vision.” The PropEquity report further stated that at 184 units, the average number of units per project is the highest in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Rajasthan at 156 units and Gujarat at 116 units. The average number of units per projects in top 10 states stands at 81 units.

The Rupee strengthened to 87.11 and ended the session at 87.20. The non-directional monthly expiry trade concluded lower at 22,545, with Nifty50’s technical levels shifting. Support is now seen at 22,400, while resistance is at 22,625, indicating that the overall trend remains bearish. Early indications from GIFT Nifty suggest a weak start for Indian equities. Despite BankNifty holding on to its gains within a specific range, a weak start could lead to a downward break. The immediate support and resistance for BankNifty are placed at 48,450 and 48,840, respectively. Among sectors, Auto is expected to trade lower, with several stocks like Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp breaking their downside ranges. The IT sector remains bearish, while the Metal sector will likely continue its negative bias, testing the lower end of its consolidation. The Realty sector has breached its previous swing support, signaling a continuation of bearish momentum, with any rally likely to face selling pressure at higher levels.

Gift Nifty at 22,540 signals a gap-down opening of about 140-150 points for Nifty at open. Analysts expect lacklustre participation from investors due to lack of triggers. The low level participation from domestic investors will keep the market under pressure due to lack of buying. Domestic markets set to open cautiously due to mixed global cues, tariff war fears, and bearish market sentiment. * FPI flows matter because of what they can do to macro conditions * Thinks share prices are likely troughing as is growth-that could spur a reversal in FPI sentiment * Share prices depend on growth and not on flows * Financials will lead the way out of the corrections * India is on the cusp of a recovery in lending, capex and consumption * FPIs have made strong equity return in long run, although underperformed MSCI India Index over past 3 years Thursday 27 February, 2025 - 12:36 AM ET Fitch Ratings has affirmed Tata Chemicals Ltd’s (TCL) Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BB+’. The Outlook is Stable. The rating affirmation reflects our view that the strong balance sheet buffers built by TCL in recent years will support its financial profile through the ongoing period of oversupply in the global soda ash industry, despite weakening EBITDA margins. The rating is also supported by TCL’s strong business profile as one of the world’s largest soda ash producers, its cost competitive and geographically diversified operations, and the industry’s end-market diversification. The Stable Outlook reflects our view that TCL’s EBITDA net leverage will remain commensurate for its rating over the financial years ending March 2025 (FY25)-FY28 Anirit Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Oilmax Energy Pvt Ltd, has announced its strategic expansion plans along with appointment of Chief Executive Officer.
