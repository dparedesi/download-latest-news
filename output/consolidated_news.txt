When Melanie* travelled abroad in July for a family holiday to Mallorca, Spain, with her six-year-old son Luke*, she found Dublin Airport stressful. Originally from Slovakia, Melanie, who works in finance, and her Irish-born husband have younger children – two-year-old twins – but Luke has profound autism and finds airports challenging. “You’re always worried there will be delays. You’re worried the plane could be sitting on the tarmacadam for three hours. If I have to keep him on a plane for five hours, he will probably walk off the plane. It’s too much,” she says. Luke has limited verbal skills and, in common with many autistic children, a tendency to abscond. “He runs away if he feels like it. One year when we were abroad we had to move chairs and luggage to block the door. The same goes for balconies.” Dining on holidays is difficult. “He’s very limited with his diet. He will eat chips or bologna sauce but the one I make because that’s the one he knows,” Melanie says. “So there’s anxiety around food because the food needs to be always the same. If it’s too much for him, he will lie down on the floor. It doesn’t matter where you are, he will just lie down. For us, it’s much easier to stay in Ireland.” For some families with autistic children, going on a break can feel harder than being at home. Lack of predictability, absence of routine and the anxieties and stress that may come with meltdowns in public settings can result in families avoiding holidays altogether. [ Why neurodivergent people are now coveted as highly skilled workers ] But as awareness has improved – it’s estimated one in 20 children in school today has an autism diagnosis – more hotels are retraining staff and improving facilities to cater to families with diverse needs. Adam Harris, of the autism charity AsIAm, which is working with hotels on training and awareness, says: “There’s an important momentum gathering. Contributing to that is our autism-friendly town initiative. Clonakilty, Maynooth, Drumcondra, Killarney and Waterford city have achieved the standard. Dublin city is working towards it. “There’s huge momentum and hotels are at the table in that regard. We’re in the process of doing accreditation with the whole iNua group,” which is Ireland’s largest regional hotel group, “so that’s exciting.” In Dublin, the Ashling Hotel on Parkgate Street, situated near the Zoo in the Phoenix Park and close to hospitals including St James’s, has 11 family rooms. Since 2023, one of these has been transformed into a sensory room, which is kitted out with mood cubes, weighted blankets, vibrating pillows and low levels of lighting. Ciara Barry of the Ashling says: “Some autistic people are sensitive to light, others to noise, others to touch. They’re able to sit down and just hug the pillow and it calms their nervous system.” Ashling staff have also received autism awareness training and the hotel endeavours to keep the same managers on rotation to welcome returning autistic children so they see a face they know. “They’re not just upgrades that we’ve done, they’re meaningful experiences for people under sometimes tough circumstances,” Barry says. The room rate (from around €260 for a family room per night) is the same as for other family rooms in the hotel, an important factor given it is estimated that it costs an additional €28,000 a year to raise an autistic child. “This isn’t something we wanted to financially benefit from. We just wanted to put something out into the community that’s needed,” she says. In developing their facilities, the Ashling took inspiration from other hotels around the country. “We were the first hotel in Dublin, but I linked up with the Pillo hotel in Meath – they were one of the first to implement a sensory bedroom – and the Radisson in Sligo have also done it,” Barry says. [ We need a more nuanced conversation about autism ] The hotel also worked with Keith O’Grady from Sensory House Ireland, which specialises in designing playrooms featuring everything from memory-foam bean bags to weighted teddy bears, lighted bubble tubes and projectors. These help to capture and regulate attention spans O’Grady says: “Ultimately you’re creating a space for calming within spaces like hotels, which can be over-stimulating, or anywhere with high footfall. We’ve done shopping centres, hospitals, the Curragh Racecourse, secondary schools like Blackrock College. “The most important things are to block out natural light and sound. People can be dysregulated by sunbeams hitting their eyes and fluorescent lighting can have the same effect. “The easiest way to explain to people is you’re trying to emulate the feeling of going into a spa. A relaxing environment with nice ambient lighting – that’s the effect you’re trying to create. You’re hopefully giving a space that they can go into, block out stimuli, and it gives them time to re-regulate themselves.” When it works, he says, families build trust with the hotels and come back time and again. “In the Ashling, people are coming back specifically to go to that hotel because they have that sensory bedroom.” It benefits all the family too, not just the autistic child, he says. “If families have a get-together, there might be only one autistic kid within the family, and it’s so they can go to that hotel, everyone can have a good time and it’s inclusive for everyone, the autistic person and not.” In Clonakilty, Co Cork, the Park Hotel and Fernhill House have evolved their offerings for neurodiverse guests. Irene O’Callaghan, of the Park, says: “We have sensory packs: the idea being that they have something to touch, something to smell and something to squeeze.” As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you Because routine and predictability can be important, the hotel offers a picture guide of what to expect when guests are visiting for the first time. With staff trained in autism awareness, the hotel tries to anticipate issues before any arise. “During the week we had a lady whose child liked a specific kind of pancake. She told us that in advance so we were able to get them in. That really helps,” she says. In addition to family rooms, the Park has 20 apartments and six units that are fully self-catering. “We would have kids who would be flight risks,” O’Callaghan says. “In our apartments we have put additional locks on the inside, so we’ve those extra little mechanisms.” While not overtly geared towards those families, Center Parcs is a popular destination for parents with neurodiverse children – their self-catering lodges set across 400 acres in Longford Forest offer a soothing, low-stimulation environment. “I know many people say Center Parcs is very expensive, but my boy loves it,” Melanie says. “In the kitchen, I can make his meals. He learned to swim in Center Parcs because they have a slide where, to let you on, you have to be able to swim without a swimming aid. So he actually learned to swim from one side of the pool to the other so he could go down the slide. It was amazing. I never thought he would be able to swim. “There’s huge supervision there. As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you.” For Etain*, an IT professional based in Dublin, who has four-year-old twin sons who are autistic, “the challenges come sideways at you”. Her twins were diagnosed in May, after they had started at preschool. “We just thought, ‘Oh my God, twins are complete chaos’. It took us a while to come around to the idea that our perfect little men might have been a bit different. “What we realised through that process was that we’d set up our life around the boys. Everything inside our bubble suited the boys. We had a nice routine. It was only when you went into the outside world that things got tricky.” The boys have differing needs and challenges. Noise can be a trigger: the white noise of hand-driers in public toilets or crying babies; big crowds another. When the family gets an invitation to go somewhere, Etain thinks long and hard about what’s best. “If it’s not something the boys are going to enjoy, we’re not just going to go so we have an Instagrammable photo.” She gravitates towards holiday homes in autism-friendly towns, where a minimum of 25 per cent of businesses in the town have undergone autism awareness training. “It’s definitely a plus,” she says. “It means you’re more likely to get a warm welcome from local businesses. If a child is finding a situation stressful, it means they don’t look at that child as a ‘bold child’.” When we speak, Etain is packing the car for Clonakilty for a family trip. “Clonakilty has a model railway village, which is a huge hit with our boys who love trains.” In their Airbnb, “the boys can see the sea from the garden. The garden is enclosed. I just love the freedom of them running around.” Having last visited at Easter, the twins have been excited about the upcoming trip for months. “The boys have had a 60-day countdown on the calendar on the fridge,” she says. Etain is willing to stay in a hotel with her sons, but it’s rarely her first choice. What would make a difference? “What hotels need to realise is parents don’t want to bring chaos. You’re not expecting people to roll out the red carpet, but small gestures like having quiet spaces or being accommodating if someone asks for a larger room, or getting your same table in the breakfast room – all those things make a difference. “In the La Mon outside Belfast, we get the same room every time we go. The hotel is spacious with a lovely quiet pool area and very warm, welcoming staff who remember the boys every time we visit, which is why we always go back.” Friendly staff, quiet spaces, a dedication to people’s needs: what’s not to like? Harris hopes more businesses will incorporate inclusive design and autism awareness training once they realise it’s an approach that makes sense for all. “Who doesn’t like clear communication? Who doesn’t like having predictability about what the experience is going to be like? Who doesn’t want to feel welcomed and not judged?” he says. “What is essential for an autistic family coming on holiday can actually be good for everybody.” *Some names have been changed. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The reality of losing a job: Silent redundancies, AI and reentering the jobs market

It’s quick, free and it’s up to you. An account is an optional way to support the work we do. Find out more. THIS WEEK SAW the announcement of jobs at risk on different sides of the market, with hundreds likely to be lost at Amazon and courier firm Fastway. If it feels like this is becoming more common, it’s because it is more common. The figures confirm your thoughts. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office showed a spike of 9.4% in ‘job destructions’ compared to the same period last year. Following the latest announcement of jobs under threat, The Journal asked its readers on whether they had suffered through this over the past year. And in response we heard of the range of emotions experienced after they lost the jobs they had held for years. Some of these roles that were lost were in high-profile multinationals, with difficulties also found upon returning to the jobs market. A certain type of redundancy that has reared its head in recent months is the so-called silent layoff – where a smaller number of jobs are trimmed by a company without fanfare or media attention. The Journal has reported on claims of similar happening at TikTok’s Dublin office for instance. Some of these silent layoffs have been taking place well before this year, but may be getting noticed more due to a perceived tightening of the jobs market. Aidan from Co Offaly worked for a gas supplier for almost 20 years, but suddenly found himself out of a job in a round of cuts. Five people lost their work, this reader recalled: Another person told The Journal that they were recently made redundant from PayPal after over a decade of employment. But the sacking didn’t come as a shock as the reader said the company has been “doing redundancies every 6 months or so for the last 2-3 years. They tend to be in small numbers so it’s not reported a lot”. “Friends of mine from my department were made redundant earlier this year so it wasn’t a huge shock to me but I was still surprised when it happened,” said the reader, who asked to remain anonymous. The blow was cushioned by a redundancy payment: “I won’t mention the amount but it was generous.” Another reader, Cork-based and working in the tech sector, said ‘restructuring’ was the reason for his layoff – and for his lack of shock when it happened. He agreed that the short-to-medium term outlook for other companies means they are either cutting jobs or not looking to hire right now. “In my experience, it’s a challenging market for job seekers. I was a jobseeker in 2018 and 2022 – tougher market in 2025. There are lots of candidates right now for non-specialist tech roles like Project Managers/Program Managers/Product Managers/Recruiters.” A Morgan McKinley report into the Irish labour market detected this same trend. These adjustments are “not immediately visible” in headline figures as they don’t require a formal notification to the Department of Enterprise – and may well help avoid negative headlines. The notifications are supposed to happen if the layoffs meet a certain threshold of a workforce, which is 30 jobs or more at larger employers. What’s driving these silent layoffs? According to Morgan McKinley, it’s most often due to a combination of global economic uncertainty, AI-led transformation and nervousness around US tariffs. AI-led transformation was mentioned by a couple of our readers who had recently lost jobs. One, a translator, said half of his department was made redundant “because they believe in AI translations, although it is not nearly as good, or nearly as precise”. “There was a redundancy package,” he said, but added: “More than the bare minimum, but less than you would expect from an IT company with good revenues and a global brand.” There’s also the not so silent layoffs. Advertisement As with Amazon and Fastway this week, major employers like Oracle have also said they’re reducing their Irish workforce. Another example of this happened to one man working at Intel’s plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare. This reader “drew the short straw” and found himself the only one in his team cut as part of the trimming to the company’s Irish operations. Recent days have marked his last day at the company he joined six years ago via a project management subcontractor. “I was told 4 weeks ago that our department had to be cut by one and I drew the short straw. It absolutely came as a shock because there is a lot of work lined up for next year,” the man said. Earlier this year, Intel announced it was cutting 195 jobs, as it battles to catch up with competitors globally. Soon after a catering company contracted for the plant reduced its headcount by 37 jobs. This man who worked for Intel has to wait to find new work through the project management firm that subcontracts him to sites. However, there has been little success just yet in finding new work. “I’ve been finding it tough the past month since I was told, very few calls or email replies regarding new positions. Leaving Ireland isn’t out of the question but I’ll certainly be leaving Dublin in the near future,” he said. Our reader who lost their job in Paypal said they are yet to begin hunting for a new job, having heard of difficulties from previously laid off friends in their old office. “They haven’t had great luck searching for jobs so far. There doesn’t seem to be many jobs going in our skillset,” this person said. “I don’t feel hopeful that I’ll get a similar job or near to the same salary.” Brian had been working in Dublin as a lecturer in English for international students but lost the job in recent months amid a fall in enrollments. Brian, who received a redundancy package of €4,020, described the search for fresh work as “awful”. “The last time I was out of work (just after Covid) I got lots of replies and interviews,” he said. “While these didn’t always work out, at least there was a responsiveness. That seems to be gone.” Instead, he feels the job search these days is “like AI is talking to itself”. He explained: “I have to use ChatGPT to try to edit my CV so that my skills appear transferable, but I’m 100% certain they are using ChatGPT to filter applications.” It’s almost as if there is a “kind of contempt from prospective employers” that wasn’t there before, the lecturer added. “I don’t just mean not having any response to an application. I’ve had several semi-formal and formal phone calls and online interviews that have had no follow up at all.” John worked for a cryptocurrency firm and has also struggled after being laid off, which couldn’t have been at a worse time given he had just got engaged and bought a house. “As I live several hours from Dublin, I would need something remote or hybrid,” John said. “Finding work has been difficult as the market is very bad right now.” Is leaving Ireland an option for some of our readers? In the main, no. Several of those we spoke to who have found themselves unemployed have been landed in this position after years with the one employer, but at a period of time where they have children or have laid other roots by buying a home. A more hopeful experience was described by Jason from Co Dublin, who found out via a Microsoft Teams meeting that he and dozens more colleagues were being made redundant by their insurance firm. The company was moving the jobs back to the US. “It was not expected so abruptly,” Jason recalled. “We were half way through our house renovation and expecting our fourth child. Losing my job was not in our plans.” After three months spent drawing the dole, he found himself “fortunate enough to be offered a good position within another company within the same industry”.

Title: 3 Signs That Institutions Continue To Drive Crypto Adoption

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Despite the price of bitcoin still making headlines, states issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, and payments use cases dominating the conversation, there are substantial other headlines that investors might have missed in this flurry of activity. Particularly with the end of 2025 approaching, and with that the increased importance and focus of tax-related conversations, investors and advocates need to be especially vigilant to analyze institutional developments as well as what these deployments might mean for the wider marketplace. Another reason why certain investors and advocates might have overlooked the headlines below is the renewed focus that crypto hacks and breaches have brought to bear on the weaknesses that still exist within the marketplace. Be it the Bybit hack that exposed the dangers of institutionally backed hacking efforts, the debut of the film Code Is Law that examined the elements of the crypto landscape that believe regulatory safeguards are optional, or the billions lost through less spectacular hacking attempts the focus has rightly returned to cybersecurity, risks around client data, and the lack of insurance solutions for crypto products. In short, the tail end of 2025 has had a bevy of headlines (good and bad), policy updates and developments that have the potential to obscure just how widespread institutional adoption has become. Let’s take a look at some of those, as well as what the implications might be for investors and advocates alike. According to several sources, Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire stablecoin infrastructure platform Zerohash for nearly $2 billion, and while this specific acquisition is not finalized as of this writing, it is indicative of how payment processing giants are prioritizing stablecoins and on-chain payments. Stablecoins have been in the spotlight recently, with a number of recent wins on the policy front as well as the deployment of stablecoin/stabletoken solutions by several major TradFi institutions. With adjusted annual volume of approximately $9 trillion, taking into account bot-based trading and other potentially artificially inflated trading activity, the sheer size of the stablecoin payment space is appealing to the payment processing space. Even as margins continue to face headwinds from a competitive and legislative point of view, stablecoins have the potential to open up an almost entirely new market for payment processors to expand. Bringing together the familiarity and security that customers have come to expect from household names such as Mastercard with the crypto-native improvements delivered via stablecoins is looking like the “killer-app” that crypto has been looking for. Another payment processing giant, Visa, is also expanding its product and service offerings focusing on stablecoin utilization and payments running on four unique blockchains. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney reiterated the firms commitment. As these new services come online, Visa will have added support for four stablecoins running on four blockchains that will be able to converted into 25 fiat currencies. This announcement expands the support that Visa already provides to other stablecoins including USDC, Euro Coin (EURC), PayPal USD (PYUSD) on multiple blockchains. According to Visa the firm has facilitated $140 billion worth of stablecoin flows since 2020, further cementing the reality that stablecoins have 1) grown rapidly in terms of institutional usage, 2) taken center stage as the “every day” crypto use case, and 3) delivers quantifiable benefits to organizations involved in the transactions. This announcement is the foundational layer for other forthcoming efforts that will allow more banks and TradFi institutions to provide stablecoin related services, including the eventual ability of banks to mint and burn native stablecoins on the Visa tokenized asset platform. Visa continues to move to integrate TradFi banking products and services with the crypto-native space, and is another example of stablecoins are leading the effort to bring crypto to the mainstream via stablecoins. The global asset management giant Blackrock has certainly made its presence known in the crypto marketplace, with its leading spot bitcoin ETF having attracted over $100 billion in assets. Additionally, a recent announcement that Securitize (a Blackrock-backed tokenization firm) will be going public via a SPAC deal valued at $1.25 billion cements. The fact that the merger will occur with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, itself a longtime service provider to Tether and the USDT token, cements the pivot of Wall Street to the tokenized ecosystem. Since Securitize operated in the real-world-asset tokenization space, a sector that Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has forecasted could hit a size of $10 trillion, the implications of this merger are significant. Tokenization or RWA is a pivotal part of the forecasted growth of DeFi systems, DAOs, and other blockchain-based applications built for enterprise use. Given the scope and scale of support provided by both Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald the effect of this listing are sure to be felt across the space. Crypto makes headlines on a daily basis, but sometimes the most significant ones can fly under the radar; those are the ones investors should be sure to watch.

Title: Amazon’s Lord of the Rings MMO canceled after layoffs as former developer laments ‘Y’all would have loved it'

In unfortunate news for J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth series and MMO fans, Amazon Games’ Lord of the Rings MMO has been quietly canceled after layoffs hit the company’s gaming sector. The cancellation has been confirmed via a now-deleted LinkedIn post (spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun) by former Amazon Games senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine. Ashleigh, who had been with the studio for over nine years, detailed in the LinkedIn post: This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it). It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this. I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve met there. Amazon announced massive corporate layoffs, which hit 14,000 staff members across the company. It’s reported that more employees will be laid off from its 350,000 workforce. Amid the layoffs, Amazon Games’ crew was hit the hardest, with an “undisclosed” number of cuts across its studios in San Diego and Irvine, as well as the central publishing team. The Vice President of Amazon Games confirmed the layoffs in an announcement, stating, “We have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development.” The company is stepping away from the MMO space to focus on casual titles, AI projects, and its cloud gaming platform, Luna. This is the second time Amazon’s Middle-earth MMO project has been canceled. Earlier in 2019, Amazon announced a partnership with Leyou Technologies and Athlon Games Studio. However, the deal was scrapped amid contract discrepancies when Tencent acquired Leyou. Later in 2023, Amazon joined hands with Embracer Group’s Middle-earth Enterprises for publishing rights for the Lord of the Rings MMO. Fans are disappointed upon hearing the loss of what could have been a new take on Tolkien’s universe. Layoffs have also hit Amazon’s New World as active development for the MMO has ended. New World’s Season 10: Nighthaven was the final major content update. Amazon announced that it would keep New World servers online through 2026 and give players 6 months' notice before the servers are sunset. Rock Paper Shotgun

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Computer scientist and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his warnings about how artificial intelligence will affect the labor market and the role of companies leading the charge. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Wall Street Week on Friday, he said the obvious way to make money off AI investments, aside from charging fees to use chatbots, is to replace workers with something cheaper. Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” added that while some economists point out previous disruptive technologies created as well as destroyed jobs, it’s not clear to him that AI will do the same. “I think the big companies are betting on it causing massive job replacement by AI, because that’s where the big money is going to be,” he warned. Just four so-called AI hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon—are expected to boost capital expenditures to $420 billion next fiscal year from $360 billion this year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI alone has announced a total of $1 trillion in infrastructure deals in recent weeks with AI-ecosystem companies like Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle. When asked if such investments can pay off without destroying jobs, Hinton replied, “I believe that it can’t. I believe that to make money you’re going to have to replace human labor.” The remarks echo what he said in September, when he told the Financial Times that AI will “create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” attributing it to the capitalist system. In fact, evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level, and an analysis of job openings since OpenAI launched ChatGPT shows they plummeted roughly 30%. And this past week, Amazon announced 14,000 layoffs, largely in middle management. While CEO Andy Jassy said the decision was due to “culture” and not AI, a memo he sent in June predicted a smaller corporate workforce “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” Despite the potential downside for workers, Hinton also sees benefits from AI. When asked if he would go back in time and stop AI from developing, he paused and said he doesn’t know. “It’s not like nuclear weapons, which are only good for bad things,” he explained. “It’s a difficult decision because it can do tremendous good in healthcare and education. It’ll do tremendous good, and in fact if you think about it increasing productivity in many, many industries, that should be good.” The problem ultimately is not due to AI itself, but “on how we organize society,” Hinton added. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Mamdani’s God Squad: The clerics, activists and political operatives who have his back

Fox News' Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest on key races to watch nationwide, including the New York City mayoral election and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. When New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani stepped to the microphone outside the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx last week near Yankee Stadium, his voice broke as he spoke about "the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after Sept. 11 because she did not feel safe." Behind him, a Yemeni-American educator in sunglasses named Debbie Almontaser nodded. Almost two decades ago, in 2007, she was forced to resign as principal of a city school after defending a T-shirt with the slogan "Intifada NYC." City officials viewed it as a call to violence. She said it was benign. Her case became a rallying cry for Muslim American activists who cast her as a victim of "Islamophobia." FBI AGENTS FROM '93 WTC ATTACK BLAST MAMDANI FOR EMBRACING RADICAL IMAM Now, Almontaser was back, this time as a senior advisor to Emgage Action and a board member of Yemeni American Merchants Association Action, two of 110 political nonprofits, community groups and political action committees backing Mamdani as he alleges "Islamophobia" against him. Recently, when critics questioned Mamdani’s ties to hardline Brooklyn Imam Siraj Wahhaj, she sprang to action, helping to organize a protest to defend Wahhaj. That rapid, coordinated response captured the modus operandi of a network of political operatives and clerics intertwined with the shared mission of catapulting Mamdani into the mayor’s office. Mamdani’s background diverges from many of his co-religionists. In an interview, he said he is a Khoja Shia Muslim, part of a small, relatively liberal sect with roots in India. Many of his New York-area allies are religiously strict Sunni Muslims who practice more conservative interpretations of the faith. But they find common ground in politics. "It’s a sophisticated fusion of religion, politics and identity," said Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism. "The same networks that once focused on community services are now mobilizing voters and producing candidates. This is how political Islam adapts inside democracy." Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington, D.C.,-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism, warns of radical forces backing Zohran Mamdani's bid to be mayor of New York City. (Mansour Al-Hadj) Mamdani’s God Squad includes about a few dozen key players who specialize in painting any critique as an attack on their faith, accusing critics of Islamophobia even as many of them have engaged in strident rhetoric against the U.S., Israel and capitalism. The Original Imam: America is "filthy and sick" Mamdani set off a firestorm Oct. 7 when he walked into Masjid At-Taqwa in Brooklyn and later posted a photo of himself beaming beside the mosque’s imam, or prayer leader, Wahhaj. Zohran Mamdani meets Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Yusef Abdus Salaam Oct. 17, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani/X) The imam’s checkered past goes back decades. In a 1992 talk, he said American Muslims should elect an "emir" rather than choose between George Bush and Bill Clinton. Soon after, he served as a character witness in the trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called "Blind Sheikh" convicted for plotting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people. "You know what this country is?" Wahhaj said in 1995. "It’s a garbage can. Filthy. Filthy and sick." In 2018, three of Wahhaj's children were arrested after authorities found 11 malnourished children in a New Mexico compound tied to his family; a grandchild had died in what authorities described as an attempted exorcism. He told local news reporters, "Whatever they did wrong … it's not acceptable to us." The Youth Imam: Resist "by any means necessary" In New York, the Muslim American Society recently signed on to a letter to challenge "unmistakably Islamophobic, anti-Black, and xenophobic" attacks on Mamdani. Signatories included CAIR National, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ New York chapter, Islamic Circle of North America’s New York chapter, the Islamic Center of Five Towns, Muslim American Society of New York, Muslim Community Network, Rockaway Islamic Center and a "Syosset Muslim Community." Members of the Muslim American Society have long been quick to accuse others of Islamophobia even as they unabashedly call for violence against their perceived enemies. At an Eid celebration earlier this year, a cleric at the Muslim American Society cast Muslims as victims worldwide. Mohammad Badawi, youth director at the Muslim American Society, declared the local community’s joy would only be complete when Muslims are "victorious worldwide," adding they would celebrate "after the destruction of the illegitimate Zionist occupiers," Israel. He regularly organizes anti-Israel protests in a campaign against "injustice and oppression." At one protest, Badawi urged youth to "fight back" against injustices "by any means necessary." Abdullah Akl, a charismatic organizer with the Muslim American Society Youth Center, leads many protests under the banner of "Within Our Lifetime," with founder Nerdeen Kiswani. Mamdani joined them before his run for mayor. Akl calls the street protests "sacred activism," a mix of faith and resistance that will "free Palestine." Since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the Muslim American Society Youth Center has organized prayer protests on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange and street protests for "Nakba Day," calling the day Israel was created a "catastrophe," and youth-led demonstrations outside BlackRock. Akl turned a subway car into a protest zone with chants of "Globalize the intifada… There is only one solution: intifada revolution." When the New York Police Department arrested Akl and other activists, the Council on American-Islamic Relation’s New York chapter sent out a press release demanding their release. During the Oct. 7 protests this year against Israel, Akl shouted, "We did not act enough! We will show up, stronger than we did the first Oct. 7." In response to criticism, he posted a message on social media, doubling down and saying, "Saying we didn’t act enough to stop a full blown genocide against palestinians [sic] is incitement?? Saying we need to be louder and protest more and continue to speak up for gaza [sic] is a crime? Zionist tears once again for the most documented genocide in modern history." For decades, Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has served as an aggressive and litigious watchdog for a host of Muslim figures and causes, often at the forefront of fighting legitimate bigotry. But CAIR has also courted controversy. Federal prosecutors named CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal terrorism-financing case against the Holy Land Foundation, a nonprofit based in Texas. In 2008, five Holy Land leaders were convicted of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas. Ultimately, no CAIR officials were charged in the case. Years ago, Mamdani recorded rap lyrics celebrating the "Holy Land Five," urging listeners, "My love to the Holy Land Five. You better look ‘em up." Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations California chapter and one of the founders of a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit, CAIR Action Inc., now seems to be pursuing a new and entirely legal means of financing causes, taking a page from the powerful pro-Israel political action committee AIPAC. He told a meeting of the Islamic Circle of North America, "AIPAC has had the run for 60 years, but it is over now. "We will teach these folks a lesson … we are coming." In another speech, he said, "The game has changed. AIPAC has been around since 1961…and now they have a formidable foe!" This summer, Mehdi Hasan, a former host at Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network, sat down with Mamdani for a sympathetic interview. As the campaign heated up, Hasan became a full-time defender on social media, swatting at critics and framing Mamdani as the right kind of provocateur, a "once in a generation political talent." Mehdi Hasan speaks onstage during the Crooked Media — Lovett or Leave It: Live on Tour, April 25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Crooked Media) Hasan’s own record includes sermons likening non-Muslims to "animals" and comparing gay people to "sexual deviants." He has said his views have become more progressive since then. After a series of plane crashes earlier this year, Hasan wrote on social media, "Make American Planes Crash Again." He deleted the message amid criticism and said, "I deleted this sarcastic quote-tweet because MAGA and Islamophobic folks are clipping it out of context and trying to ridiculously suggest I’m inciting violence. I was obviously mocking the MAGA slogan ‘Make America… Again’ slogan and highlighting the shocking number of plane crashes under Trump and the FAA cuts. But this tweet was in poor taste, poorly worded, and has allowed people in bad faith to call me a terrorist…" Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, selling the puritanical Salafi interpretation of Islam, literally wrote the book on "Understanding Salafism." Recently, he posted a two-part thread on X endorsing the idea of Mamdani’s win as a "civilizational victory." Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, has encouraged support for Mamdani for his "courageous stand against Zionism," among other things. (Getty Images) He urged Muslim Americans to move beyond "naive" religious critiques of politicians who are more socially progressive than they are comfortable. Meanwhile, Qadhi once mocked European Jews as "white, crooked nose, blonde hairs" and "not a Semitic people." In the same lecture, he recommended a book, "The Hoax of the Holocaust." Most recently, he has backed the controversial Muslim housing development outside Dallas, "EPIC City." He noted in his Instagram post, "open to non-Americans as well." He touted some of its features, writing, "Islamic schools, college, masjid." Imam Khalid Latif is a popular chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City, a $22 million project to build a hub and "our own space" on Sixth Avenue for young Muslim professionals. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year and has been an ardent supporter. He has called him "a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare." Imam Khalid Latif, shown here speaking at Lincoln Center in 2022, is the chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year. (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) In 2012, Latif led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen, and he hasn’t faced the same type of allegations that surround other imams. After the backlash to Mamdani’s meeting with Wahhaj, he posted, "Happy birthday to my brother Zohran… Keep showing them who we are by showing them who you are." He invoked the divine to bless Mamdani’s mission, revealing the fusion of religion and politics for the Mamdani God Squad: "May your 34th year be one of clarity, courage, and closeness — to your purpose, your people, and your Creator," ending with the Arabic word for amen, "Ameen." On Monday, Latif posted a sassy video from the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, saying, "The name is Mamdani, M-a-m-d-a-n-i," with Latif mouthing the part where the narration turns to, "You should learn how to say it." That day, Latif delivered a speech to support Mamdani, pivoting to allege Mamdani was now a victim of "anti-Black racism," saying, "Anti-Muslim sentiment is always" a symbol of "anti-Black racism." In a glowing portrait, The New York Times called Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour a "Brooklyn home girl in a hijab." Over almost a decade, she has been a political mentor to Mamdani, inviting him into the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, which she co-founded. She later endorsed his race for the New York General Assembly, which he won. Activist Linda Sarsour speaks earlier this year at the Lights for Liberty vigil held in protest of the Trump administration's ICE actions. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) All the while, she has been a polarizing figure, once saying about two critics, author and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali and activist Brigitte Gabriel, "I wish I could take their vagina away - they don’t deserve to be women." Ali is a survivor of female genital mutilation, a practice that involves cutting the clitoris of a young girl with the idea that it will inhibit sexual promiscuity. As a co-founder of the Women’s March, Sarsour stepped down amid criticism of alleged antisemitism and not welcoming Jewish feminists who support the state of Israel, or "Zionists." At a rally on Sunday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Imam Latif told 13,000 people, "This is our city. This is our moment." Some Muslims beg to differ. "It’s not our moment," said Al-Hadj. "Across the boroughs, the Mamdani God Squad is banging a drumbeat of grievance after grievance, from Staten Island to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Long Island," he said. "Across the city’s Muslim institutions, you hear the same drumbeat: They smeared us. They silenced us. They fear us. "In that rising volume, something is lost: Muslim pluralism. The God Squad does not speak for every Muslim in New York — nor for every Shia, every Sunni, every immigrant family, or every second-generation kid trying to thread faith and freedom. It speaks for a coalition committed to illiberal ends, with socialist capture of city politics on the one hand and puritanical religious rhetoric on the other. They insist that to oppose them is to betray the community, so they actually push their own tyranny." Win or lose next week, Al-Hadj said, the Mamdani God Squad had actualized the words that had gotten Almontaser into so much trouble years ago: "Intifada NYC." Asra Q. Nomani is the author of "Woke Army: The Left-Green Alliance That Is Undermining America’s Freedom," and the founder of the Pearl Project, a nonprofit journalism initiative. She is co-founder of the Clarity Coalition and Muslim Reform Movement, opposing Islamic extremism and advocating for Muslim reform. She can be reached at asra@asranomani.com and @AsraNomani on X.

Title: These are the 3 signs your company is about to make layoffs: career experts
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/01/lifestyle/these-are-the-3-signs-your-company-is-about-to-make-layoffs-career-experts/

With Amazon, UPS, Target, and Skydance Paramount all announcing layoffs this week, many workers are worried their companies will be next to make cuts. But experts say there are three signs that a round of redundancies is on the horizon — so take note to avoid being blindsided. “Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they’re taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,” Jason Walker, co-founder of Thrive HR Consulting, told CNBC. The first sign is “a slowdown in hiring,” recruiter Jalonni Weaver revealed to the website. If new roles don’t get posted, or vacant roles aren’t filled quickly, “it’s never a good sign that you’re doing well financially.” Meanwhile, a change in corporate messaging is the second sign that the company could be looking to let some staffers go. “There’s a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,” consultant Rosie Nestingen told CNBC. Rey Ramirez of Thrive HR Consulting agrees. He advises employees to look out for phrases such as “we need to be more efficient” as a potential sign that the business could boot people in the near future. Thirdly, a reduction in some workers’ hours is another indication that layoffs are looming. “Employees can’t afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,” Ramirez explained, labelling a reduction in hours as effectively “quiet firing.” Other tactics, such as “return to office” mandates, are also deliberately designed to reduce headcount without the company needing to announce official layoffs. Still, it paints a picture of a company that could be mulling cuts in the near future. Amid a sluggish economy and anxiety about AI, Weaver advises all workers to keep their resumes up to date, just in case. Even if you aren’t planning on jumping jobs, the recruiter recommends applying to other roles on occasion in order to make sure your CV and skills at interviews remain “competitive.”

The Bitcoin whitepaper, A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, published by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, turned seventeen years old yesterday. Released on Oct. 31, 2008, amid the global financial crisis, the nine-page document laid the foundation for what would become the world’s first cryptocurrency. The whitepaper outlined a vision for a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system built on cryptographic proof rather than trust in third-party intermediaries. Its goal was to eliminate the problem of double-spending and enable online transactions without relying on banks or other trusted third parties. “We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust,” Satoshi wrote. Seventeen years later, Bitcoin’s influence has reached far beyond the cypherpunk forums where it began. The anniversary comes as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in less than two years of existence have experienced unprecedented success, seeing total net inflow of over $62 billion and total net assets exceeding $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data. But Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance extends beyond Wall Street. It has now entered the highest levels of government, including the White House under the current U.S. administration. Some of Bitcoin’s most outspoken critics have become its biggest advocates. In 2021, former President Donald Trump dismissed Bitcoin as a “scam against the dollar.” Yet by the 2024 presidential election, he was urging supporters to “never sell your bitcoin” and went on to sign an executive order establishing a bitcoin strategic reserve. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager once called Bitcoin an “index of money laundering.” Today, he champions it as one of his firm’s most successful ETF products and views it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability.Likewise, Michael Saylor, the outspoken CEO of Strategy, has become one of Bitcoin’s most persistent evangelists, continuing to accumulate BTC through stock and debt offerings. Saylor himself began as a skeptic, once declaring, “Bitcoin’s days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” The last major holdout among prominent financial figures remains JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who continues to voice doubts about Bitcoin’s value and sustainability. His bank though, has heartily moved into the sector, including recently allowing clients to pledge bitcoin as collateral. The financialization of bitcoin through ETFs and corporate treasury adoption has drawn comparisons to the mortgage securitization boom of the 1970s an era that saw asset prices soar to new heights. Yet this evolution has not pleased everyone. Many early Bitcoin believers argue that that its very ethos, a form of money outside the control of the state, has been diluted by institutional adoption. For the cypherpunk movement that birthed Bitcoin, the system’s embrace by Wall Street and Washington feels like a paradox: a rebellion absorbed by the establishment it once sought to disrupt. On an annual basis, the average transaction fee per bitcoin block has fallen to its lowest level since 2010, raising concerns about the network’s long-term sustainability. Low fees, while attractive for users, reduce incentives for miners who secure the network, especially as block rewards continue to halve every four years. Originally envisioned as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin has increasingly been overshadowed by the “store of value” narrative. "Never sell your bitcoin," is a common refrain from Michael Saylor to the Trump family and many voices in between. At the same time, controversy continues within the developer community particularly between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots over whether the network should allow non-monetary data like Ordinals or enforce stricter rules to block it. Some see such restrictions as necessary to preserve the network’s integrity, while others view them as a form of censorship that alters bitcoin’s open and permissionless nature. Beyond internal debates, the looming question of quantum computing also poses an unresolved risk. The potential for future quantum machines to break existing cryptographic standards could threaten Bitcoin’s security, with no definitive solution in place yet. “It’s no doubt that Bitcoin has arrived, accepted by Wall Street, and its sustained period above $100,000 confirms that," said Bitcoin OG Nicholas Gregory recently. "Its transition from peer-to-peer cash to a store of value is evident," he continued. "It remains to be seen where it goes long-term. I, for one, think the narrative of it as a medium of exchange is key to its enduring place, along with solutions to the quantum threat."

Title: AI Blamed for Tens of Thousands of White Collar Layoffs
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-white-collar-layoffs
Time Published: 2025-11-01T13:45:00Z

By Rae Witte Published Nov 1, 2025 9:45 AM EDT There’s no question that the job market is a mess. According to Labor Department data, nearly two million Americans have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, the highest figure since 2022. And it’s hitting white collar jobs hard: this week alone, Amazon cut its corporate workforce by 14,000 jobs, UPS cut 34,000 operational workforce positions, and Target and Paramount axed 1,800 and 1,000 jobs, respectively. Many are blaming those cuts on AI. Everyone from Senator Bernie Sanders to Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is wringing their hands about the tech’s effect on employment. Mike Hoffman, CEO of growth advisory firm SBI, told the Wall Street Journal that productivity surged when he cut his software development team by 80 percent. And Meta just culled 600 employees from the AI Superintelligence lab — after dropping billions to beef up the team — and blamed advancements in automation. Others aren’t so sure. New research found that even the world’s strongest AI agents struggled to perform the vast majority of tasks that companies currently lean on independent contractors for. According to a recent study from MIT, 95 percent of companies that adopt AI see zero meaningful revenue growth. Some companies are finding they’re forced to hire contractors to fix AI’s mistakes, or even to re-hire staff they terminated in favor of the tech. It all raises an interesting counter-possibility: maybe instead of AI actually replacing human-level intellectual labor, bosses are running with the narrative that it’s ready to replace human workers to justify layoffs — when what’s really happening is they’re offloading work onto a smaller human workforce, or forcing their overburdened remaining employees to produce lower quality results. The reality is that there are other major headwinds dragging down the economy. The US is now in a perpetual state of political uncertainty that has directly impacted many employers. President Donald Trump’s tariffs were announced, postponed, instated, rolled back, rinsed and repeated; his restrictive immigration policies and deportations are shrinking the workforce and increasing labor costs; cutting the $7,500 consumer incentive for electric vehicles is forcing layoffs in that sector. AI is a flashy scapegoat for mounting white collar layoffs, in other words, and if it keeps improving, it may eventually pose a real threat to jobs. But for now, it feels more like a bogeyman to rationalize short-term cost cutting — and any companies that indulge in it may find that they’re undermining their reputation and institutional knowledge for years to come.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you're one of the millions of unemployed Americans looking for work right now, it's clear the job market is tough. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in August, the number of job seekers outpaced available openings in the US for the first time since April 2021. The shift comes amid a wave of layoffs this year across major employers, including Amazon, Meta, and GM. For many out-of-work Americans, it's easy to feel discouraged — but there's still hope. WalletHub has ranked the best and worst cities in the US for job hunters, showing where your odds might be strongest and weakest. To find out where you'll have the best chance at landing, keeping, and actually enjoying a job, WalletHub compared all 50 states using 34 metrics that reflect job-market strength and economic health. These include factors such as employment growth, median annual income, average commute time, job security, and even the likelihood that artificial intelligence could take your job in the future. WalletHub found that many of the best states for jobs are clustered in New England, the Upper Midwest, and the Great Plains, with Texas being the lone Southern state. Despite their regional and industry differences, from tech in Massachusetts to agriculture in the Dakotas, these states share common strengths: low unemployment, solid job growth, and business-friendly environments. "The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits," said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo. These are the 10 best and 10 worst states for job prospects, according to WalletHub. Business Insider added September median home sale prices from Redfin and 2024 median household income data from the Missouri Census Data Center's ACS Profiles. Jump to

The Fed cut rates by 25 bps, fueling optimism after Amazon’s $180.2 billion Q3 revenue beat and AMD’s 58% monthly jump. With AI stocks surging, inflation easing, and rents falling, investors eye November for fresh highs — unless rising CRE delinquencies or job losses trigger a pullback.

Title: YouTube CEO emphasizes AI as the next technological frontier
URL: https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/youtube-ceo-emphasizes-ai-technological-frontier/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T11:11:20Z

YouTube is embarking on a transformative journey into artificial intelligence (AI), as CEO Neal Mohan outlined plans to position the platform at the forefront of this technological shift. In a memo to employees earlier in October, Mohan declared, "the next frontier for YouTube is AI", unveiling a significant reorganization of the company’s product and engineering divisions, which will take effect on November 5, 2025. To better align YouTube with its AI-driven ambitions, the company will restructure its operations into three primary product organizations, all reporting directly to Mohan. Johanna Voolich will oversee Viewer Products, managing areas such as Search and Discovery, the Living Room app, infrastructure, and Trust and Safety. Meanwhile, the Creator and Community Products group, temporarily under Voolich’s leadership, will focus on YouTube Shorts, Live, and expanding generative AI tools to assist creators. Christian Oestlien will lead the Subscription Products division, handling YouTube Premium, Music, TV, and other over-the-top initiatives. The company is also making internal changes to improve efficiency and collaboration. The UX organization, led by JT, will integrate with Scott’s engineering team to streamline processes. Similarly, the Shopping group, under Travis’s leadership, will continue to report to Scott. Mohan emphasized that these adjustments aim to strengthen decision-making, enhance accountability, and ensure high-growth areas receive the necessary focus and investment. As part of the restructuring, YouTube introduced a voluntary exit program for U.S.-based employees within Mohan’s direct reporting organization. The program offers eligible employees the option to leave the company with a severance package, although the precise number of eligible employees remains undisclosed. A YouTube spokesperson clarified that the program is voluntary and does not involve layoffs or role eliminations. Details of the program are being communicated individually to those eligible. Mohan has been vocal about AI’s potential to transform YouTube’s platform and services. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he stated, "AI in service of human creativity" is a central focus for the company. He explained how AI can enable creators to generate ideas, develop visuals, and enhance video production more efficiently. "I do think creation is an area where AI will help enormously by making the process easier, faster, and more powerful", Mohan added. The new Creator and Community Products organization will lead the development of these AI-powered tools. This commitment to AI mirrors broader trends in the tech industry. Major companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google’s DeepMind also recently announced significant organizational changes to integrate AI into their operations. However, unlike many of these companies, YouTube’s approach does not involve layoffs, instead opting for voluntary departures to adjust its structure. The reorganization comes at a time of robust financial performance for YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet. The company recently reported its first-ever quarter with revenue exceeding $100 billion, with net income rising 33 percent year-over-year. YouTube contributed significantly to this growth, generating $10.26 billion in ad revenue during the third quarter of 2025, a 15 percent increase from the previous year and ahead of Wall Street expectations. Acknowledging the platform’s success, Mohan highlighted YouTube’s evolution. The platform has paid more than $100 billion to its creators, maintained its position as the leading streaming service in the United States for over two years, and grown its user base to 125 million YouTube Premium and Music subscribers, along with 8 million YouTube TV subscribers. Despite this growth, Mohan noted that the core leadership structure "has not evolved in a decade", necessitating the reorganization to better align with the platform’s current scale and complexity. In his memo to employees, Mohan expressed optimism about YouTube’s trajectory. "It’s an incredibly exciting time at YouTube, and many opportunities and challenges lie ahead", he wrote. "Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform." The changes, he noted, are designed to enable the company to "make the most of this opportunity" and ensure leadership teams are well-equipped to prioritize high-growth areas. As YouTube moves forward with its restructuring, its focus remains clear: leveraging AI to enhance both content creation and user experiences, signaling a new chapter of innovation for the world’s largest video platform. The changes will officially take effect on November 5, 2025, marking the beginning of what Mohan described as "an incredibly exciting time at YouTube."

Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam! It was painfully obvious what the extraterrestrials on board 3I/Atlas were thinking, they’d heard from across the universe about Bitcoin and were eager to invest, the blue light emanating from the spacecraft an attempt to fill a buy order, alas out of range yet. Could be. I heard they were arriving just in time for the Chiefs/Bills game. The plan was to land on the 50 yard line just before game time and auction off Gort to the highest bidder. Maybe to raise funds to buy that Crypto? …what sort of forty time does Gort got? When your reach extends from one sideline to another, and no one can block or tackle you, speed doesn’t matter much. And he can play both sides of the ball and never break a stretch. Try him at RB, TE, LT or DT. The Wunderwaffe of all time. Gamechanger! Wukchumni and Henry Moon Pie: klaatu barada nikto The interesting thing about the interpretations of 3I / Atlas is that the asteroid is beyond the Sun. So it is cutting through the solar system at a time when no one on Earth can see it — blocked by the Sun and too far away. And, yes, it has many weird qualities. “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Milton Friedman, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Nevertheless, it has also arrived at an astrologically volatile time. All of the majors — Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter have gone into (and sometimes out of) retrograde in the second half of 2025. Mercury is due to go into retrograde again on 10 November in Sagittarius, the sign that 3I / Atlas emerged from. This fashion mag gives a highly detailed horoscope: https://www.russh.com/every-retrograde-in-2025/ When the biggies — Jupiter, his brother Neptune, their dads Saturn and Uranus, gods of time — all move together, even the skeptics among us (and I’m fairly skeptical) should take notice. Some “deep astrologers” think that we are receiving a signal of moving collectively into a new epoch. So there is life after Trump Derangement Syndrome. Maybe Jupiter can detach the claws of Bill and Hillary from the Democratic Party. Is Zohran Mamdani a sign of a new age of Saturn, peace, prosperity, and low-cost groceries? The golden toilet in the White House remains unexplained. [I will consult my patron, Mercury, who is more or less in charge of grocery stores.] After 3I/Atlas touched down on the White House lawn and Atalasians emerged, an excited President Trump almost immediately slapped tariffs on them, claiming ‘they’ve been cheating earthlings for far too long…’ Well, there are serious matters afoot. My page shows the Galactic Council (a bunch of commies, for sure) as arriving and sorting this earthly human cesspool out. They will instruct us as to having empathy for all life. Obviously they haven’t heard of the “Dark forest” theory… “‘Sobbing daughter captures ICE ‘detain her mom for not having social security number memorized” I got an idea. All those emigrants could easily have their Social Security number tattooed on their lower arms and as it is only 9 digits, would not have to be big. That way if ICE pulls them up, they can proudly pull up their sleeves and show those agents their Social Security number as that seems to be the only number they are interested in. Any resemblance to this idea and a practise that was undertaken in Eastern Europe in WW2 is just a coincidence. Don’t give anyone in DC ideas. What! no bar code tattoo to expedite ICE processing? That will go on your neck and be your Permanent Record Identifier. According to the Department of Public Information, there is no truth to the rumour that the first three numbers of everyone’s PRI number will be 666. Stay safe, and grey. You people need to get along with the zeigeist. Nowdays, everyone gets a chip under the skin. I’ve Got You Under My Skin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1AHec7sfZ8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MYizva-7o Really interesting article on lead exposure in early humans. Loved the points made regarding Neanderthal extinction and the potential linkages to Speech Sound Disorder and Autism. Radiation hormesis now comes to lead, just in time for the Trump Administration to loosen pollution restrictions. Convenient! I was very much surprised to read how many of those caves were contaminated by lead. How did that work out? It seems to have been widespread but I would have assumed that having places with lead deposits as well as developed caves would have only been a very small percentage and not over 70% like is suggested here. Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as a pigment to produce white in their cave paintings? Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as the pigment for face and body decoration goop? The Left Wins the Irish Presidential Election in a Landslide Counterpunch To give some background – Catherine Connolly is an ex Labour activist who left due (apparently) to internal fights within her local party. She was little known outside her constituency, although she seems to have been very well liked by other politicians including centrists – her two political jobs – Galway Mayor and Deputy Speaker for the parliament are both decided on open votes, which means a lot of the centre and right will have supported her. She was considered an outsider for the post, but as none of the left parties could agree on their own candidate, she became the de facto left candidate. She was also aided by the two centre right parties making an appalling mess of their campaign. She is a barrister and very good with both the public and on TV and won very easily. She has a long, consistent history of being on the general left of politics and in particular anti-war and anti-imperialism and pro-palestine (before it was fashionable, as they say). More recently, she seems to have become more nationalist on Irish unity (she keeps quiet on this as it’s the primary ideological issue dividing the left). The Presidential post is largely ceremonial and she will have little real power. It does have two significant political outcomes: 1. It will make it almost impossible for the current government to weaken Irish neutrality. She cannot block any attempt to join Nato or take part in military action, but she has the capacity to create a constitutional crisis over it, so no government would consider it worth the effort to try. It was never likely, but its pretty much an impossibility now for the next 7 years. 2. It greatly strengthens Sinn Fein (centre left/nationalist/republican). They initially couldn’t find a candidate that had any chance, so reluctantly backed her. But as they have by far the best electoral ground game, they became the de facto main partner in a loose alliance of left parties and the Greens. While that alliance lasts, it shows its possibilities in another election. But more crucially it has seriously weakened the current Prime Minister who despises Sinn Fein – it seems very likely he will not make it to the election. His likely successor belongs to the republican radical wing of his party, one much more likely to join forces with Sinn Fein. So this could give SF two potential coalition partners after the next election – a left wing/green alliance, or a centrist and left Republican one. They probably prefer the second option. She sounds very much like an Irish traditionalist in having Ireland be neutral and also pro-Palestinian out of principle. If she is there for the next seven years, then it may stabilize Irish politics and stop the idea I have heard of Ireland going into NATO so it can give all its military equipment to the Ukrainians and give Zelensky a coupla billion Euros. Forgive me as I have not been following Irish politics as closely as I used to, but is there really a movement among the Irish center-right to abandon neutrality and join NATO? The very idea seems so shockingly bad to me I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read your comment! No politician in Ireland who wants to get elected openly calls for it, but there is a lobby within the establishment who does want it (as this widely mocked article indicates). Michael Martin, the current PM, would try to move Ireland towards Nato if he could, but his party would never allow it. It would be a massive vote loser. The complication for Ireland is that even though it is not part of Nato, because of the lack of investment in defence over the years, the country has had little choice but to rely on UK/US and other European military help with various issues, from intercepting aircraft in Irelands aerospace to maritime rescue and heavy lift capacity for pulling citizens out of trouble around the world or in shoring up Irelands UN contingent (there has been an Irish Battalion in the Lebanon for nearly 3 decades now). For pragmatic reasons, Irelands small military accepts Nato standards for its equipment. So while neutrality is extremely popular with the electorate and the foreign establishment is split over this, no government aren’t actually willing to put in place a meaningful defence force. Interestingly, Sinn Fein has started calling for much more military spending. It is quite possible to envisage a situation where Ireland accepts membership of Nato as part of a deal for unification. I would prefer Sinn Féin to find a UK political party that would agree to leave NATO to enable unification, I.e. a common Ireland-Britain defence area as well as a common travel area. Although NATO may leave us first! :-) “US begins troop drawdown in Romania” Not just Romania but apparently Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia as well in December. I would imagine some panic in NATO over this as there might be the suspicion that Trump will eventually reduce US troop numbers until there is only a tripwire force left in Europe- https://www.kyivpost.com/post/63332 Not much profit to be had from only a tripwire force. They only need a skeleton force required for ISR the rest will be done with proxies. that is the European and West Asian plan. That is the impression that I got. That Trump & Co want Europe to field a strong military so that it can be its proxy force for that continent. The US would provide military equipment – at marked up prices – Europe would receive satellite data from the US but more to the point would have the US calling the shots for that European military like it does in places like South Korea. Maybe too like in South Korea, that there would be a US general put in charge of these European forces. maybe too the US would order deployment of that European force to places like Asia, maybe even Taiwan. A US general is, and has always been, the military head of NATO. This is no different, in practice, from US SK command structure. Would that include in combat as well? I know that is so for South Korea. Of course. SACEUR (who also has the US “hat” of COMEUCOM) has operational command from SHAPE in Mons, BE. Dubai: the dark truth — what lies beneath the wealth and glamour? – The Standard Read to me like an indictment of many parts of the world including Dubai. It takes global partners of privilege to create that kind of system. Some multipolar exploitation going on there. Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R) The author of the Dubai piece seems to agree. Her concluding paragraph: “My fear is that we, in our rotting democracies, will become like Dubai, because to value this is to value tyranny, whatever name you give it, and there’s a word for that. Decadence: always the final age of empire.” I think our would-be techno-feudal overlords have a vision. It’s Dubai, but ruled by billionaire genius philosopher-kings rather than Sultans. Guys like Trey Goff will build it for them, and useful political lackeys like those in Congress and the Trump administration will make it possible. It takes a globe full of accomplices to create such a system. The world doesn’t have a “Trump” problem. Way beyond that. That’s the overarching point. Multipolar exploitation. I can only imagine the “Freedom City’s Mengele Institute For Anti-Aging” Re: “Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R)” Yeah, me too. But ‘Startup Cities’ then led me to this gem: Inside the ‘Whites Only’ Community in Arkansas https://archive.ph/PvvVD But nothing new about building on the backs of indentured servants or slaves. That’s what “freedom cities” ultimately mean by “regulations”. Don’t even get me started on what they think is “science”. I just remembered…what happened to all those private islands? Why couldn’t they start this shit on those? Oh…that’s right…a parasite needs a host An ode to the soon to be “rare” 2025 penny, see lower. Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01, which I grant still find useful in smaller exchanges of hard cash and currency…Maybe the retailers should be permitted to either round up or either round down, or just round it off period (!) Compliments of an 1980s song from Madonna… “Only boys who save their pennies, make my rainy day” The Chain Cent was the first effort by the US Mint in 1793, and they were about the size of a half Dollar. Fitting that we’re seeing off Mr. Lincoln~ A nice example is worth the big bickies, $126k https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1793-1c-chain-america-bn/1341 As a young teenager I would often gather coins in “vast numbers” twice per week on a small town paper route. For a measly $0.25 one could read all the news fit to print, and at the end of the afternoon I could saunter into the Wachovia branch to exchange those coins for “dollar dollar bills y’all….” So if I sold say 100 on a good day I was doing well even if it’s small time consumer paper media so to speak… Might have found a few wheat pennies on my route too! All this in a pre-internet world. What a seemingly more simple time. Those rainy fall and winter afternoons were awful though on a two wheel delivery machine. When I was a kid “Indian Head” pennies were a thing for collecting. Same for war cents and nickles. In some local auction decades ago, I bought this big lot of soup to nuts coins that had a couple of rolls of 1943 steel Cents which had been copper-plated to look like the real thing worth around $250k each instead of a Dime, and I spent them all over LA, one at a time over about a decade. I feel certain more than a few people got really excited about their ‘find’. https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1944-1c-steel/82722 “Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01…” As you probably know, Canada ditched the penny already. It’s predictable! “Oh, it costs more to make it than it’s actually worth…” Two comments: 1. I remember as a kid in the US that I really liked the Eisenhower Dollar. Kind of like what my elders said, you knew you were holding something when you had one of those in your hand. All in for universal sufferage and thought the Susan B. Anthony was a good coin, but it just wasn’t a “real” dollar to me. Paper? Pfui. 2. Experience here in Canada seems to be mostly people don’t miss the penny. The bulk of people pay with a debit or credit card, and the rounding doesn’t apply to those. Cash transactions can be amusing to sort out. Always a gamble: am I going to pay more than the actual bill, or less? Fortunately Canadians don’t seem to be disposed to yank a handgun out and start blazing away because they got “cheated” by the system. We’re told it balances out in the long run. I wonder how much longer we have to run. I also remember when I first came to Canada there was some debate over the idea of minting a $5 coin to go with our $1 (“Loonie”) and $2 (“Toonie”) coins. The biggest debate was over what to call it. “Foonie” just rang like a lead bell. Ultimately the mint deployed the cost argument, though now I guess they’d just say everybody uses a card so it’s not a thing. I talked to a presenter at the British Museum after she gave a talk in their coin gallery. Their pound coins were relatively new at the time. Having seen some pretty wretched examples in commerce during our visit, as well as the simple design, I asked her what percentage of circulating pound coins she estimated to be “homemade”. She lowered her voice and said in a “don’t tell” voice it was around 60% (!!!) I never understood why they didn’t just get rid of the nickel also. Then instead of $1.23, for the price tag would be $1.2. Just like in Hong Kong. I have a vague memory of reading someplace that having prices like (say) $2.99 instead of $3.00 makes it more difficult to pilfer (this would apply to cash transactions, not credit or debit). Can’t remember the logic behind it though. China? I cannot find official Chinese confirmation that China will pause its rare earths export permits, per an X post by Arnaud B: https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1983910248416211116 – I checked and was unable to find a notice on the official Chinese govt website regarding rare earths – but did find notices on tariff rates and soy beans. Although we have Trump The Fantabulists’ words (echoed by the media), however, he has form. If so, the economic implications to high tech (and the MICC) remain. I also recall that in the prior restriction, I read a report where after several months, China was only able to process a handful of permits. I also saw nothing about Nexperia. Side note, for a 90-minute meeting, 20-30 minutes are for opening statements, 10 minutes for closing statements, so 50-70 minutes of translation-slowed discussions means equivalent to ~20 minutes of normal discussion for issues with complex details. So did they run out of time before discussing rare earths, or was it just a case of: Trump: “About those rare earths?” Xi, “不是 (Bushi) – No.” Trump: “So No Lunch or press briefing.” Xi “Yes.” Trump: “Fine, I was going to order a round of fast food burgers.” Xi “Fine: We will buy some soybeans, if you drop tarriffs.” Trump: “Ok. Ummm. Hmmmm. How’s the weather in Beijing these days?” I wouldn’t put it past Trump to lie. He has made shit up before. “24 hours to end the Ukraine war.” Part of the issue is that nothing is in writing. Both parties are free to exaggerate, charitably. Trump has changed his mind so many times and flip-flopped that these may be Schrödinger’s tariffs. “24 hours to end the war in Ukraine” is not a lie. That was, and still is, quite possible. Can you end the war in a way that keeps the Russophobes and neocon crazies happy in 24 hours? No, you cannot. But you can’t do that in the next 24 years either. So I’d argue ending it in 24 hours where everyone is unhappy is actually a great idea. Fellow Chris: I think the lie was that he would actually do it, not that it was possible. A total cutoff of aid, along with making Zelensky persona non grata the minute he started whining about ceding territory, would have likely done the trick. Too bad he lied to his base. It really is a pity he lied. I wish he had followed through with the promise. It looked like he was going to. Witkoff put Bibi in his place for a minute before Trump was even sworn in. And now… we have even more war and chaos. Once I tried to talk a snake out of shedding its skin. Never again. Or the US has more nuclear weapons, I guess he doesn’t think his base understands how to use Google; or maybe that the sycophantic media will not question if the emperor’s new clothes leave him naked. ‘Heather Johnston @HeatherJ_Israel My name is Heather Johnston, and I am the Founder and President of @USIEducation I am deeply concerned about the hate that Tucker Carlson is spreading in our country. As a supporter of the Heritage Foundation, I am asking Dr. Kevin Roberts to clarify his statement regarding Carlson. Israel is central to God’s divine purpose, and we need to know where the Heritage Foundation stands. @KevinRobertsTX’ Oh god. It’s Zionist Karen. And she’s demanding to talk to the manager of the Heritage Foundation. The tucker Carlson interview was my first real exposure to Nick Fuentes. I’m almost done, but I’ve watched most of it. I actually thought that he came off as reasonable. He’s a very good and talented speaker, maintains a good flow and poise. He’s overcome a lot which is impressive, was kicked off YouTube, was on the no fly list, was being threatened, had hundreds of people come to his home, etc After he did a debate in college, a daily wire employee asked him if he’d like to visit Israel, he said no. But the main reason that he has a bright future is that the establishment is not providing an alternative. Nobody under 40 is ever going to be passionate about Lindsey Graham or Ted Cruz or Ben Shapiro. Hey, Afro, don’t blame old people for Graham, Cruz or Shapiro! Age has nothing to do with it. Take it from an ‘over 80!’ Tucker’s Christian theology is spot on, though I wish he’d named the heresy he was talking about. Darbyism is a 19th century invention by a British Calvinist. Spread through the Scofield Bible, it’s contrary to 1.900 years of amillennial eschatology shared by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Reformed churches. Those Catholic church leaders that at best turned a blind eye to the kiddie fiddling surely can’t have believed in the dogma of heaven or hell as a soul’s permanent location in the afterlife. Because they would had had a firm idea about which location they’d end up in. My, what pretty evangs you’ve got… I love it when they go to the good book in order to defend Israel at all costs, where history majors in a narrow vein of events in an isolated area of the orb a few thousand years ago still resonate today. Reading the Gospels, quoting Jesus, Carlson is correct! There is no ‘love thy neighbor” in the militarism of the US and its zionist spawn! That said Augustine’s “just war doctrine” is excuse for heresy! Not one bullet fired by or for US/Israel in the last 80 years is “just” murder. So says me a repenting US airman! JD Vance and Augustine: https://martycenter.org/sightings/the-problem-with-jd-vances-augustine Thank you for the linked article! I was indoctrinated in the Just War by a USAF chaplain in the run up to Desert Storm! I took him as wrong at the time. I did not find out the rite of the chaplain. At that time I did serve in the states. Augustine excused Christians to get involved in Constantine’s state sanction murder. My best feel for Augustine is the quote: “Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.” That aided my re-conversion and return to the Roman Church. Repentance is key That said in my seeking who is “thy neighbor” I go to the Good Samaritan and no further. Your neighbor is Jesus you see in every one you encounter. See especially the two mainstream men who passed by the sufferer. Samaritans were outcast to observant Jews in the setting of the parable. Augustine, doctor of the church, was not a pope and thus evidently fallible. He also gave us the curious concept of Original Sin. According to Hudson Augustine changed Debt to Sin or Economics to Sexual Mores I think. Popes are fallible too. At least, that’s what Dante said, and he encountered one. Papal infallibility is a 19th century construction (and only applies to church doctrine) so all of the popes have been more fallible than not. What’s going on with Bill Krystal? Somebody may need to check on him bc earlier in the week, I think he endorsed Mamdani for mayor! Rat departing a sinking ship. If you live in NYC, there is increasing desperation from the Cuomo campaign and wealth funded surrogates. Not to mention even more anger directed at Curtis Sliwa. God forbid the actual Republican candidate stay in the race, rather than prop up the sore loser who couldn’t accept that voters didn’t agree with his delusional belief that he got to be mayor just because he wanted to restart his political career so he ran again as an independent. Look this is NY, and we now have unaccountable electronic voting machines. Cuomo could still win. But all indications are that he is losing by a significant margin. Not enough of one in my opinion, but still significant. Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Associated Press (Kevin W). More incompetence. Australia got rid of the penny before 2002, and required retailers to round up or down to the nearest five cents. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As you say, every other country got rid of small change pretty effortlessly… I’d guess the last time you could buy something with a lowly Lincoln would’ve been around 1980 from a gumball machine near you. The last time we ditched a denomination was in 1889 when we 86’d the Three Cent Piece, been a spell. it’s called ‘Swedish Rounding’ by the way. Time to buy boxes of nickels at face value from your local bank – the copper and nickel contained therein is worth double or more face value – to sell to refiners when it’s discontinued? I read several years ago that Kevin Bass I think, did so to the annoyance of the local Federal Reserve bank. It’s a bit tricky separating copper from nickel, is what I’ve been told. Wanna buy my 75% copper & 25% nickel Nickel ingot? As a fetish object, perhaps, more than an investment… :-) “EU parliament could block Russian media – Politico RT” Here in the UK, RT is already blocked. I can only access it through a VPN. Imagine how afraid they are that people may read the other side of the story. I will never really grasp how this insane level of censorship went through in Germany without a peep by MSM or parliament. If you know the status quo before this whole shitshow started it by large parts remains inexplicable. http://Www.swentr.site is your friend. I love the Russian trolling. It’s a true mirror URL… re: Germany – Israel – critical interview This is as much of a critical perspective on Israel that you will get by an established German reporter, Michael Lüders (German category of Chris Hedges, although he was no real war correspondent and much more benign in his views.) Which on the other hand by way of looking at those attacking him tells you the level of incompetence on the region by many German establishment morons. Lüders was Middle East correspondent for Germany´s biggest weekly DIE ZEIT. ((the) time) In case you can stand YT´s automatic dubbing in English, you can listen to it (it´s less obtrusive than German dubbings). Otherwise translate the transcript that comes with it. Interview with Michael Lüders: How the West supports Israel’s attacks on seven countries “Michael Lüders studied political science and Islamic studies in Berlin and Damascus, was a Middle East correspondent for Die Zeit for many years , and is currently a member of the extended board of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). In this interview, he discusses his new book, “Dirty Work: Israel, America, and Imperial Megalomania,” and Israel’s wars of aggression against Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Qatar. Lüders explains how Israel and the USA secure their power in the region through wars, sanctions, and regime change, why Germany supports this policy, and what the consequences of a new war against Iran would be—for the entire region and far beyond.” The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes 60 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=141335 German Wiki on Lüders https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L%C3%BCders re: Poland – Michael Jabara Carley – This piece was published originally on the Strategic Culture site which is banned from NC. However Michael Jabara Carley is one of the major authorities and he has not published there since 2020 (for whatever reason.) So I hope this is no violation of any sorts! If so, my apology. – This is pre-WWII but it fits the subject, I by coincidence just reread the piece a few days ago Michael Jabara Carley, downloadable pdf “What Poland Has to Hide About the Origins of World War II” Michael Jabara Carley Université de Montréal January 2020 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338543470_What_Poland_Has_to_Hide_About_the_Origins_of_World_War_II The outlook wasn’t brilliant for an unfortunate nine that day: The score stood three to three, with but one stanza more to play, And then when all hope died at first, and the other team did the same, A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, “If only Shohei could but get a whack at that— We’d put up even money now, with Shohei at the bat.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One of the best World Series i’ve seen in a world of Sundays, final game tonight, can’t wait. It’s had everything, almost. Great defensive plays, great pitching, weird plays, firsts of all kinds, including Freddie’s second walk-off homer in the 18 inning game (“Let’s play two!”) a record for any player in any combination of World Series games in history, and Shohei’s mind-blowing performance in one of the early games. But in my opinion, it’s not really baseball anymore, with all the rule changes they’ve made in the past 10-15 years to make the games go faster. No thinking between pitches, just throw another in a hurry, all DH now, bigger bases, etc. The last big rule change before this latest flurry was to lower the mound because of Bob Gibson’s unhittable pitching and it actually seemed to make the game better, but these latest ones are making it worse. Say what you will about his otherwise lackluster hitting in this Series, Freddie is “The glue in our clubhouse” according to the last two great manager’s he’s played for. Steady Freddie, indeed — Hall of Famer first ballot no doubt. Interesting that Atlanta fell apart after their World Series win when they let him go to the Dodgers, and the Dodger’s have now won one and may win two with him on the everyday roster. I never thought I’d be a Dodger’s fan, but Freddie’s the last link to Chipper, who was the last link to Maddux, Smoltz and Glavine who were the last links to Otis Nixon’s wall-climbing “The Catch” and Sid Bream’s slide into home. When Freddie’s career is done, my days of watching baseball will likewise be over. But this has been a historic Series, no matter, and I’m on the same page with you, waiting anxiously. pre-game starts in 10 minutes, game 7 of this incredible Series starts at 7 central time. Spoiler alert but don’t check the internet or on your phone. Waking up but my brain thought it was 7:45 AM Eastern but it really is 6:45AM….roll back the clock but repeat that October victory sensation for your Los Angeles Dodgers. So… happy for Freddie Freeman but that’s about all I can muster. I do think Roberts is a good manager, particularly when I consider the near misses from Bobby Cox whilst managing the Braves some 30 years ago in their heyday. “Report: Iran rebuilding its ballistic missile program” Israel would be very keen on attacking Iran once more – with America’s help of course. Trouble is that Iran is rebuilding their stock of missiles again as they have the industrial capacity to do it. And it seems that the Russians are helping them with their aerial defenses as Iran has finally realized that it needs help here. In addition, most of the groups that Israel set up in Iran are now gone and Iran will be carefully watching countries like Azerbaijan which aided the Israelis in their attacks. They will be a much tougher nut to crack next time. For their part, resupply of Israeli aerial defense missiles are probably proceeding slowly as those missiles take some time to build each. And now they know that Iran can hit any damn place that they want to and it does not matter if they have help from countries like the US, the UK, Jordan, etc. they do not know what to do next. So unless something tips the balance radically in favour of Israel, we may have a status quo developing where Iran won’t attack Israel and Israel can’t attack Iran. Sounds good to me. IDF does not have the wherewithal to do a Curtis E LeMay (bomber Harris with B-29’s and two A bombs) on Iran, too much geography, too much hardening, some level of air defenses. US help is limited by local infrastructure and depth of magazine which is already devoted to IDF. Do we really believe air shafts in Iran are straight and B-2’s can follow them …… Or that USAF flew 14 B-2’s in the same year. Your arguments are very logical and rational, and thus, sadly, irrelevant to the Israeli religious fanatics led by an indicted criminal who goes to prison if the war ends (and incidentally hell bent on genocide – making the IDF the true marvel comic book evil that used to be reserved for WW2 Germans with black uniforms). Israel is not being resupplied by building new missiles – that is too slow, and that was before the rare earth embargo of the US MICC. – They are being resupplied from the existing stocks underlying US-China war dreams. Let them be sent, and the US is rapidly losing its fevered war dreams (in a Thucydides trap). I trust European intel sources were totally honest with CNN, and not propagandizing regarding Iran Rebuilding its missile capabilities. Actually, an honest assessment would state that Iran is building out its capacity, particularly of the newest missiles, which were not used – they used such a minimal fraction of their stocks. Definitely not the same people who have been saying Russia is running out of missiles since day one are saying the same about Iran, despite its prepping for a US-Israeli war for decades.

Honestly seems very bizarre Interesting about Dubai. I am a fan of movie composer Hans Zimmer’s concerts including one in Dubai where he talks about how much he likes it there. Each week there is another fawning article about Dubai. Beyoncé sang there; Rio Ferdinand moved there. Westerners think it is “safe”, which is laughable. The talk is in English so doubtless his appreciative audience includes those wealthy British expats. But the article suggests his just folks vox populai patter may be cloaking an ugly reality. Still he is a very good musician Various right wing media ‘personalities’ or ‘influencers’ in England have very loudly moved to Dubai, because ‘there is too much immigration in England’ and ‘England is no longer safe because of immigrants [read Muslims]. But, of course, they will be ‘expats’ there rather than immigrants and only mix with their own kind in any case. My fascination with YouTube crochet and 90s rock channels has led to some interesting commercials. There were a whole series of commercials touting Dubai as a tourist destination for families, girls trip, honeymoon… It was yet another instance of cognitive dissonance for me. I could only wonder if tourists were limited to certain areas, almost like a Disneyland version of it. IA long time ago I read this article about Dubai; your comment caused me to dig it up again because it left an impression with me. It described a cruel, empty place that is all façade and inhabited by vapid rich people without empathy. A fake Disneyland for the wealthy and a hot hell for everybody else, run by a dictator. https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/the-dark-side-of-dubai-1664368.html >Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Instead of abruptly discontinuing the production of one-cent coins, the U.S. government should have continued producing them using less expensive metals. After all, the government once profited greatly from producing steel pennies. A more honest idea would be to do what all countries eventually do when debasing their currency via inflation, just chop a zero or two off so the dime or the dollar would be the new penny. Would ditch those pricey nickels too. Even better, be proactive and make it three. What really is the point of units which are so worthless that one will not purchase anything? It’s because without it, you couldn’t skim off the top with a sales tax. Or more pertinently these days, a ‘merchant fee’. At least with a sales tax, we get fire trucks and clean water. – ‘Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post This Post article is our political system in a nutshell. Our Establishment Democrat Governor, forced to support the nominally Democratic candidate for NY Mayor (in as unenthusiastic a manner as possible), regretfully explains why she just can’t tax the rich because it would hurt the “middle class.” The right-wing Post pretends to champion the “middle class” while accusing Hochul of pandering to the “radical left.” All those people chanting at Mamdani rallies or potentially voting for him in an election apparently don’t exist; at least they don’t count in the Post’s political world. I guess it is good, though, that at least everyone is so concerned about the welfare of the “middle class.” I’d better read that Daily Mail article next so I can really know what’s going on. They put the White House on a piece of land Where Foggy Bottom used to stand Before they put up a bowling alley In the basement where Tricky Dick would dally That’s where the big names used to come and play My sources tell me Kissinger hurled there on a Saturday Don’t come dancing The East Wing ballroom has come undone Why not come dancing?

Just look in the Dutch crystal ball” Got myself completely sidetracked with this article – it’s been one of those days. Near the top is an image of Geert Wilders and for a long time I thought that he looked kinda familiar though you wouldn’t think so. Then the other day I realized where from. Has anybody seen that old 1955 scifi film “This Island Earth”? https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/characters/nm0607504/ China’s rare earth export delay offers US a chance to weaken Beijing’s grip on the market – Associated Press The USA also has to watch out for creating deficiencies in other critical areas. I was reading the story in links the other day about huge areas of farm land going to data centers. But this thinking assumes people making decisions or lobbying those that do are actually concerned. Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. Plus it’s kind of expensive for what it is – a slightly fancier Taco Bell but still fast food. I don’t think more “digital experiences” and dollar sauce options are going to fix what’s wrong there. The kids don’t have money for garbage food. The third time I went to Chipotle I got food poisoning so severe I was hospitalized for 7 days followed by 7 days of recovery at home where I was incredibly weak. I will not step a foot into a Chipotle again. A good many stand alone ‘Meskin eateries here, especially so in the towns that are almost all Hispanic (read Mexican) in population, and I’m looking at you Farmersville, Ivanhoe and Woodlake. All the field workers are Mexican, so the food is authentic and tasty. The true test of a restaurant is their chile relleno… Why go to Chipotle? Absolutely the test is how good are their chile rellenos. I always order that. When it’s good it’s wonderful. My restaurant test for first time eating is red chili. If they ace that, we will return. Also, Yuma AZ has some great authentic Mexican restaurants. Why go? For the ugly, dystopian decor that looks like the set from a sequel to “Aliens”? For the seating so hard and uncomfortable that you are left with sciatic nerve pain for the rest of the day if you sit for more than five minutes? For the beef and chicken rendered so inedibly tough that it should have a warning label and come with a side of dental floss? Yes, I always try the relleno but for me the true test is fresh home made tortillas. They are really hard to find but nothing better. since only really fancy places like Mi Tierra in san antone make Mole, anymores, Tam’s Test Dish was always carne guisada. my test in all eateries is to first observe the back door and the dumpster area(if theres cats, thats good), then upon entering thru the front, take a deep whif of the air(sour smelling oil=bad), then immediately wander to the loo, and endeavor to get a peek into the kitchen(clean-ish(i understand the demands) but more importantly, happy people in there who are having a good time) save for chinese food, i prefer mom and pops. for chinese, i prefer corporate….esp panda express. due to a lack of cats and stray dogs in the neighborhood of this place we went to in san angelo. (amfortas winks) (there are exceptions to this moratorium on mom and pop chinese joints, of course…Mencius, there on medical drive, there in san antonio is excellent…they even let me into the kitchen, under the “this chef wants to see how the pros do a certain thing”. any place that shows such professional courtesy is a good place, generally, in my experience.) Before I quit the Twitter, I’d see occasionally retweets of people complaining about the prices at Chipotle, so their struggles isn’t really news. I was taken once as part of a corporate informal lunch 10 years ago. Not sure what the fuss is about. I never went back, and it was overpriced in 2014. Here are the owners of Chipolte: https://brandsownedby.com/who-owns-chipotle/ Never was a big fan. I would only do take out the times that I used to go. I needed to take it home and add some seasoning and to make it hot. Adding that extra heat could have been what saved me from these scary food poisoning incidents. Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. …Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice… Well, you can’t fool me twice… W. BlackRock loses $500m on shadow banking blow-up So, apparently Black Rock could only be bothered to do due diligence on a $500M loan after the cash went down a rabbit hole. We’re doomed. Ha. I’m free if they have another 500m ready to burn. I’m sure I can manage it better than they can, and I’ll only charge them 2 and 19 instead of 2 and 20. So what are we looking at, super volatile interstellar comet, a fragment of engineered material reacting to solar flux? Or something designed to reveal itself only under extreme energy exposure? Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a solid icy nougat nucleus wrapped in a coma of cloud of gas and lemony icy dust escaping from the nucleus. Bluer than the Sun. Zestier than any Earth lemon. Watch the skies! Keep looking! Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post “I’m concerned about outmigration of people who are the ones who are supporting our budget,” Hochul said on the “Raging Moderates” podcast Tuesday about the top 1.5% of earners fleeing if she raised their taxes like Mamdani wants.” She claims NY has a middle class, but says the top 1.5% of New Yorker’s are supporting the budget. The Vampire State is incredibly agressive about income tax. Anybody without dependent kids, or unable to access one of the enormously long list of exemptions for special interests and cronies, has to pay on even the most limited income. They must also have a huge staff at the tax department since they recently audited my middle class income returns going back at least TEN years, and came up with demands for taxes, interest and penalties. I would have to see some real figures on that, both raw data amount and the percentage of income paid in taxes compared to those who aren’t in the top 1.5% . Not that our political leaders would misrepresent data for the benefit of their bigger donors. No, never. Obama is calling Obama Calls Mamdani to Praise His Campaign and Offers to Be Sounding Board (NY Times) Good luck with that. re: Venezuela vs. CIA fwiw Tom Griffin´s Substack The CIA and the Cartel de los Soles How a flawed counter-narcotics operation christened the enemy du jour Tom Griffin Nov 01, 2025 https://intelligencehistory.substack.com/p/the-cia-and-the-cartel-de-los-soles Interesting that we see this: Trump Says US Not Considering Venezuela Strikes https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w_gN7BeAgj4 And this is one of the many stories that get reported: Military strikes on Venezuela appear increasingly likely https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5584228-us-strikes-venezuela-maduro/ And if this is what the Western MSM thinks of him, imagine being a country trying to negotiate with Trump. re: Federal Reserve “The regulatory changes the Fed is considering could enable banks to lower their capital ratios enough to offer borrowers an additional $2.6tn in lending capacity, according to consultancy Alvarez & Marsal.” That’s a good way to get a lot of small community banks and regional banks into trouble again, as happened during the subprime crisis. Many many of those banks were consolidated with buyouts into larger banking entities at the direction of the FDIC. If one wanted to further consolidate the banking sector and reduce the number of community and small regional banks, this is one way to do that, imo. It’s never the smaller banks that get bailed out. The smaller banks get eaten. And an aside about the private credit crisis that’s looming: The big banks beginning after the GFC essentially stopped loaning to small businesses, that created the environment for the expansion of existing and creation of new private credit outfits. Small businesses still needed operating capital loans, and when their longtime big bank stopped lending even though the small business owner had never missed a payment or been a problem, they naturally turned to local private credit outfits. If there’s a problem now in the private credit market, it’s a crisis the big banks created, imo.

A score or more container ships per month loaded up with homeless Americans in exchange for some rare earths would be a win-win deal, no? /s re: Ukraine War MOON OF ALABAMA Ukraine – Hail Mary Operation To Unblock Pokrovsk Has Failed https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/11/ukraine-hail-mary-operation-to-unblock-pokrovsk-has-failed.html “Nvidia’s market cap is now greater than the GDP of every country in the world except US and China” While I really dislike Nvidia and think it’s way overvalued, comparisons between market caps and GDPs always seem a bit misleading. Market caps are more of an estimated lifetime value while GDPs are yearly stats … at least to this non-finance guy. Sure, it’s apples and oranges; but it’s a convenient way to put these absurd numbers into context. What else are you going to use? Count the sand on the beach? I would like to see a simple, easily understood metric used. Let us consider a mature P/E ratio as Nvidia ages to a mature company, free of hype. Assuming Nvidia achieves a P/E ratio of 10:1 as it (or the sum of pieces it may split into) ages, then Nvidia (or sum of pieces) would need to earn $512 billion per year. Someone buying Nvida would then see earnings of about 10% of original share purchase price. Alphabet (Google) reported earnings of $100.12 billion in the year ending Dec 31, 2024. Nvidia at 5x Google’s yearly earnings seems like a very tall order as this level of annual earnings would be bound to attract competition from other semiconductor firms. And Google’s earnings report might be more solid from an accounting standpoint. >Euro-homeless, time to hit the trash heaps? Alex 1970 +7 Today, 08: 34 Do you remember what the price of gas in Europe was after the outbreak of the Nord Stream 2 disaster, and what it is now? Prices have returned to 2013-2014 levels. Banning rare earth exports is also disadvantageous for China. Yes, there’s a crisis now, but they’ll resolve the situation the same way they did with gas. Back then, they also wrote that there was nothing to replace Russian gas and that Europe was doomed, industry would grind to a halt, and the population would freeze. Propaganda, that’s just propaganda. It has nothing to do with analysis. Monster_Fat +4 Today, 08: 52 Yes, yes, all the “Euro-homeless” will soon run for the dumps, just as they have been freezing for several years now, without Russian gas, undernourished without Russian wheat, sitting in the dark without Russian electricity, without paper due to the lack of Russian timber supplies, without metal products, having switched to stone tools since they no longer buy metals from Russia, and without plastic products, oils and other chemicals since they no longer have Russian oil…. The end of the EU is coming… true, this is not certain and only in the Russian media, but oh well… It’s surprising that Russians are skeptical rather than welcoming the decline of the EU. It’s not the end just a lot more money going to middle men. And of course trickling up to more ‘important people’. Chipotle stock craters as company says young people without jobs can’t afford their food anymore. I suggest the company hire Luigi Mangione as the company spokesperson, in the manner of Colonel Sanders or Ricardo Montalbán. The guy has tremendous star power in his own right, and could help position Chipotle as a defender of the poor and downtrodden instead of a ruthless up-charging corporate monster. There will be no charge for this idea. re: bird flu The zoo in Swiss Bern developed a vaccine against bird flu and presented it early this year. However the vaccine although working well was rejected in the EU for alleged safety concerns. I suspect lobbying – both by Pharma and food industry – have achieved here a twisted, genuinely Pyrrhic victory. European poultry industry is huge ($56B), followed by pork ($43B), then beef ($26B) annually. Imagine someone introduces a simple and easy to do solution for this bird flu problem that people could apply without a huge pharma company behind it. DIY-basis.

Title: How Amazon flipped the script on a challenging week

Every time Eugene publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tuesday brought 14,000 job cuts and fresh AI concerns. By Thursday, investors were cheering. It was a turbulent week for Amazon and its CEO Andy Jassy, marked by historic layoffs and rising doubts about AI, followed by a swift 48-hour rebound that reassured investors. Wall Street is impressed — Amazon shares hit record highs on Friday — though questions remain. "Amazon isn't perfect, and we are seeing increasing urgency in defending their cloud leadership position and reclaiming some of the unique culture," Baird's senior analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider. "Jassy's strategy is proving successful, even if there are still some wrinkles to work out." Tuesday's layoffs fueled concerns about Amazon's AI prowess, sparking questions over whether the cuts reflected slowing growth or that efficiency gains were paying off. The company said it was a preemptive move that makes it "leaner." Even before the layoffs, Amazon was contending with a widening perception that it was trailing in AI, with a top Wall Street analyst calling it an "AI laggard." On top of that, Amazon's yearlong push to streamline its culture and cut bureaucracy had yet to deliver stronger shareholder returns. Jassy has cut the manager-to-employee ratio by 15% this year as part of a broader push to instill discipline and reshape Amazon's culture. Until earlier this week, it was the only one of the seven largest tech firms to underperform the broader market over the past five years. Investors were especially worried about Amazon Web Services' slow growth, the company's high-margin cloud unit. Though it maintains a far larger revenue base, AWS' growth has lagged behind competitors such as Microsoft and Google. "AWS revenue growth acceleration is a must," CFRA wrote in a research note last week. Amazon put those concerns to rest on Thursday. The company's third-quarter earnings topped expectations, and it raised its capital spending forecast amid surging demand. AWS reported $33 billion in sales, a 20% increase, its fastest growth since 2022. The company also made a number of disclosures that showcased its progress in AI, including: Wall Street loved what it saw. "The AWS unlock is here," wrote Evercore's Mark Mahaney. Financial firm William Blair called it "a key step in reclaiming the narrative," while Barclays wrote in a note that "the past 48 hours have gone a long way to dispelling concerns." "AWS is gaining momentum," Jassy said during Thursday's earnings call. Still, skepticism remains. AWS may have pioneered the cloud, but the rise of AI is reshaping the landscape and giving rivals fresh ways to compete. Some of its flagship AI products have failed to gain much traction. And it didn't help that Jassy sidestepped an analyst's question on Thursday to specify how much of AWS' growth came from AI versus its core infrastructure business. DA Davidson's Gil Luria, who remains bullish on Amazon, told Business Insider that AWS still hasn't matched Microsoft or Google Cloud's lead in AI mindshare, and has plenty of catching up to do. "Amazon has been the slowest of the three hyperscalers in commercializing AI," Luria said. There's also uncertainty about whether the layoffs are over. Jassy said Thursday that the latest cuts weren't driven by cost pressures or AI, but by cultural alignment, implying the shake-up isn't done. "It's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do," Jassy said. Have a tip?

Title: CEO Andy Jassy says Amazon’s 14,000 layoffs weren’t about cutting costs or AI taking jobs: ‘It’s culture’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Amazon’s CEO has finally spoken up about the company’s 14,000 layoffs earlier this week, and he claims the motive was not at all financial. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, CEO Andy Jassy said laying off those employees was about a mismatched cultural fit—and nothing else. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said about the job cuts. “It’s culture.” The job cuts this week, which mostly affected middle managers, follow a June memo in which Jassy said Amazon will need fewer employees thanks to the “efficiency gains” brought on by AI. In a separate memo announcing this week’s layoffs, Amazon’s senior vice president of people said the layoffs were about adapting to “transformative technology.” Jassy also mentioned Amazon’s business has grown over the past years. The company has about 1.55 million total employees, with 350,000 corporate employees alone. As of December 2019, prior to the pandemic, the company had 798,000 total employees, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you’re in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” he said. This type of growth can lead to consequences, Jassy added. “Sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line,” he said. A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment. Amazon joins other companies such as Salesforce, Target, and Paramount who have together laid off thousands of workers in the past few months. Several large companies have cited AI as a reason for hiring pauses or layoffs recently, said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell this week, adding that the Fed is “watching that very carefully.” To be sure, a study of Goldman Sachs investment bankers this week found only 11% of their corporate clients were actively laying people off due to AI. In contrast, about a third of companies in the technology, media, and telecommunications category are reducing headcount because of AI. During the quarterly earnings call, Jassy seemed to echo the sentiment, saying the “technological transformation” currently underway means companies need to be nimble and adaptable. “It’s important to be lean, it’s important to be flat, and it’s important to move fast,” he said. “That’s what we’re going to do.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: The job market may be sinking. Why you should beware of buyouts.

You’ve been offered a buyout. Your employer wants to pay you to quit. It’s a big chunk of change. But leaving your job now would mean searching for a new one in a weakening job market. Should you accept the offer? Companies offer buyouts to thin the ranks, spending money in the short term to save money in the long run. Employers often leverage buyouts to avoid layoffs in a shaky economy. And that thought, alone, should give you pause. The Trump administration offered buyouts to the entire federal workforce this year, aiming to reduce it by as much as 10%. Roughly 75,000 workers accepted. More recently, Amazon, UPS and Target all announced private-sector layoffs. Buyouts can sound tempting. A five-figure severance package might be the most money a worker has ever seen in one paycheck. But it’s also the last paycheck your employer will give you. “It’s like lottery winners. Some people think the money lasts longer than it does,” said Donna Walton, wealth strategist at TD Wealth. If you are mulling a buyout, some considerations are universal: How large is the severance package? Am I close to retirement? Did I want to leave that job anyway? But the current economic climate presents its own challenges. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, according to the latest federal report. Unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since October 2021. Nearly 2 million Americans have been out of work for six months or longer, the Labor Department reported in May, the largest number in more than two years. Companies are doing less hiring out of uncertainty about President Trump’s tariffs. Artificial intelligence is swiping jobs from new graduates. Recession fears loom. “It is a very soft job market,” said Michele Evermore, a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, and a former Labor Department official in the Biden Administration, speaking to USA TODAY earlier this year. “It’s such a period of economic uncertainty, I think people are hanging onto their jobs.” Here are five tips for employees who are thinking about taking buyouts in 2025. Let’s start with a proactive step. Maybe your employer hasn’t offered a buyout. But you’re restless to make a change, and you’ve heard your company wants to cut costs. Consider approaching your managers and asking for a buyout. In many cases, there’s nothing to stop an employer from creating a voluntary severance package just for you. “You do see these things happen, particularly if there’s news that a company is planning on downsizing,” said Michael Scarpati, CEO of RetireUS, a financial wellness platform. “It’s kind of a win-win for both parties.” If you’re the first to ask for a buyout, you may get a better severance package than the one your employer eventually offers everyone else. But don’t ask for a buyout if you aren’t ready to take one. “You have to be willing to leave if they do offer it to you,” Walton said. “It’s not something you want to bluff about.” A typical buyout might offer four weeks of pay, plus another week for every year you’ve worked at the company. You might get extra health insurance coverage, even help in finding a new job. Roughly half of workers accept buyout offers without negotiating, AARP reports. But it can’t hurt to ask for better terms. “Think of it as if you’re going in for a job interview,” Scarpati said. You could ask for a full year of severance pay, rather than a few months. Perhaps your employer will cover the costs of health insurance while you look for a new job. Some workers hire attorneys to negotiate buyouts, said David John, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. That might sound extreme, but remember: A buyout is a business proposition. The contracts can be complicated, sometimes including non-disclosure agreements or non-compete clauses. Even if you don’t bring a lawyer to a buyout negotiation, Walton said, “you should at least meet with one.” Unless you’re planning to retire, experts say, you should gauge your chances of finding another job before you leave your current job. If you work in a shrinking field, or in an economically afflicted region, you may already know it. “It’s a pretty different thing to take a buyout in D.C. if you work in a thinktank, or to take a buyout if you work on an oil rig in South Dakota,” Evermore said. Look at Labor Department jobs reports, Evermore said, to find out how many people are applying for unemployment insurance in your area, and how many are lingering on the benefit rolls. Better still: Apply for some jobs. See if you get bites. If not, that might be a good sign a buyout isn’t for you. In the best-case scenario, you can line up a new job before you take the buyout. Many employers offer buyouts to avoid layoffs, or at least to delay them. If you have a buyout offer, weigh the odds that the company will resort to layoffs once the buyouts are past. “A responsible company will address those worries right off the bat, and say yes or no,” said John of AARP. If layoffs are likely, think about whether you might land on a layoff list. Ask your manager if you are vulnerable. If your company has endured layoffs in the past, look at the severance packages those workers received. In some cases, Walton said, a buyout package might be “the same thing your company offers you if it lays you off six months from now.” Many federal workers who took buyouts from the Trump administration had only weeks to decide. That’s not nearly long enough, experts say. “Asking someone to make a major life decision that may involve relocating your whole family, you should get at least a few months for that,” Evermore said. Ideally, Scarpati said, six weeks is a “minimum” timeframe for a buyout offer. Ninety days is more reasonable. Use that time to “think about where you’re at in your career,” Evermore said. Talk to friends, colleagues and loved ones about your options. Test the job market. Ask yourself if you’re ready to uproot your household and move across the country. And run the numbers. If you are mid-career, do you have enough emergency savings to survive a period of joblessness? How would you cover health insurance? How generous are the unemployment benefits in your state? If you are near retirement: When were you planning to take Social Security? How would you cover health insurance until Medicare kicks in? Do you have enough retirement savings? Consider meeting with a financial planner. “Ideally,” Walton said, “have this financial plan done before any of this happens.”

Title: U.S. Health Insurers Face Headwinds as Q3 Earnings Reveal Mounting Cost Pressures

Time Published: 2025-11-01T09:01:14Z
Full Content:
U.S. health insurers experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting increased medical costs and significant policy-related pressures, which led to a notable decline in share prices across the sector. U.S. health insurance companies encountered substantial financial headwinds in the third quarter, reporting results marked by escalating medical costs and the looming impact of legislative changes. The sector's performance lagged the broader market, with several major players experiencing significant stock price depreciation. The third-quarter earnings season, which commenced on October 21, unveiled a consistent theme of increased cost pressures across the health insurance industry. A primary driver of these rising expenses has been the government-subsidized Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans, where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, specifically highlighted heightened acuity levels among its Medicaid enrollees following the resumption of state-led procedural disenrollment in March 2023. Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) reported a substantial $6.6 billion third-quarter loss, a stark contrast to its $713 million profit in the same period last year. This loss was largely attributed to escalating healthcare costs and a $6.7 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. The impairment was a consequence of a sustained decline in Centene's stock price throughout 2025 and the anticipated financial repercussions of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which forecasts $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies over the next decade. Centene's health benefits ratio (HBR), the proportion of premiums spent on medical care, climbed to 92.7%, up from 89.2% a year prior, underscoring the rising cost burden. Market reactions to these results were swift and negative. Since October 20, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares fell 9.1%, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) declined 5.4%, and The Cigna Group (CI) dropped 19.5%. The most pronounced decrease among major managed care insurers was recorded by Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH), which saw its stock price decrease by 23.5%. These declines surpassed those of the broader market, with the S&P 500 falling 2.47% and the S&P Insurance Index decreasing 2.15% over the same period. The adverse market reaction reflects investor concerns over several interconnected factors. Primarily, the rising medical expense ratios indicate a squeeze on profitability, particularly as insurers grapple with sicker patient populations in government-funded programs. The "One Big Beautiful Bill" has introduced significant political uncertainty and financial risk, with projections suggesting it could eliminate health coverage for nearly 12 million Americans. This directly impacts insurers like Centene, which manage Medicaid plans for over 12 million low-income individuals. Furthermore, issues are not confined solely to Medicaid. UnitedHealth also noted the expected impact of changes within the ACA markets. The company anticipates that rate increases exceeding 25% and targeted service area reductions could lead to a decrease of approximately two-thirds in its Obamacare customer base, potentially forcing over one million enrollees to seek alternative coverage. These aggressive actions, while aimed at improving margins in the employer and individual segment by 2026, suggest ongoing struggles to achieve targeted profitability levels. The sector's performance in the third quarter highlights a challenging operating environment exacerbated by both fundamental cost pressures and a shifting regulatory landscape. The substantial goodwill impairment reported by Centene underscores the market's re-evaluation of long-term prospects in light of evolving healthcare policy. The company's valuation review specifically cited the expected financial impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a key factor. The broader market implications are significant. As insurers face increased costs and legislative changes that could reduce their customer base and subsidies, the sustainability of current business models, particularly within government-sponsored programs, comes into question. The aggressive rate hikes by UnitedHealthcare in the ACA marketplace indicate an industry-wide effort to adapt to these new realities, potentially at the expense of market share. While specific analyst quotes were not provided in the briefing, the collective sentiment from company executives and market movements suggests a cautious outlook. UnitedHealthcare chief executive Tim Noel indicated that the company's submitted rate filings reflect the 2025 morbidity and experience, including average rate increases of over 25%, as a necessary measure to improve margins. The acknowledgment that these margins are still projected to remain below the targeted 7–9% range for 2026 further underscores the persistent challenges. Investors will closely monitor several key factors in the coming quarters. The full implementation and impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and its projected cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will be a critical determinant for sector profitability. The ability of insurers to manage medical costs effectively, particularly within Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, will remain paramount. Furthermore, the strategies employed by major players like UnitedHealthcare to navigate the ACA landscape, including the potential for significant enrollee shifts, will provide insights into the sector's adaptability. The interplay of legislative policy, evolving patient demographics, and cost containment efforts will define the trajectory for U.S. health insurers in the near to medium term. ## Archer Aviation Shares Advance Following Korean Air eVTOL Aircraft Purchase Agreement U.S. aerospace manufacturer **Archer Aviation Inc.** (NYSE:ACHR) has entered into a significant agreement with **Korean Air** (KRX:003490.KS) for the commercialization of **Archer's** Midnight electric vertical takeoff and landing (**eVTOL**) aircraft in South Korea. This partnership involves **Korean Air's** commitment to purchase up to 100 Midnight **eVTOL** aircraft, marking a notable development in the advanced air mobility sector. ### The Event in Detail The agreement outlines **Korean Air's** intention to integrate **Archer's** Midnight **eVTOL** aircraft into its operations. Initial deployment is expected to target government applications within South Korea, with subsequent expansion into broader commercial use cases. **Korean Air** projects that the Midnight aircraft could potentially replace 60-90 minute car commutes with 10-20 minute electric air taxi flights, emphasizing safety, sustainability, low noise, and cost-competitiveness. The Midnight aircraft has undergone extensive performance testing, including a piloted flight covering approximately 55 miles in 31 minutes and reaching an altitude of 10,000 feet. **Archer Aviation** has strategically bolstered its intellectual property portfolio by acquiring **Lilium GmbH's** approximately 300 patent assets for €18 million, expanding its total patent assets globally to over 1,000. ### Analysis of Market Reaction The announcement has contributed to sustained positive momentum for **Archer Aviation's** stock. The company's shares have delivered a 252% return over the past year and climbed 17.24% year-to-date. This partnership is viewed as a positive catalyst, potentially enhancing **Archer Aviation's** valuation and strengthening its market position, which could foster increased investor confidence. However, valuation analyses present a nuanced picture. A Discounted Cash Flow (**DCF**) model by Simply Wall St estimates **Archer Aviation's** intrinsic value at $29.60 per share, suggesting the stock is trading at a significant discount (62.4%) to its theoretical value. Conversely, an InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently trading above its fair value. **Cantor Fitzgerald** has maintained an "Overweight" rating on **Archer Aviation** with a $13.00 price target. The contrasting valuation perspectives highlight the speculative nature inherent in emerging technology sectors. ### Broader Context & Implications **Archer Aviation's** recent stock performance underscores a period of heightened investor interest in the **eVTOL** market. Despite the impressive stock gains, the company's financial profile reflects substantial investment in growth and development, with a reported Free Cash Flow of -$472.3 million. Analysts project a turning point for cash flows, expecting them to become positive around $286 million by 2029, with more distant estimates reaching approximately $1.53 billion by 2035. The company's price-to-book (**P/B**) ratio stands at 4.27x, slightly below its peer group average of 4.39x but notably higher than the broader Aerospace & Defense industry average of 3.70x. While this indicates a premium valuation compared to the broader industry, it is in line with the higher growth expectations of the **eVTOL** sub-sector. A recent development indicates a delay in the certification of **Archer's** battery-powered air taxis, with passenger flights now anticipated to commence in 2026, a year later than the previously projected 2025. This delay could introduce some uncertainty, although the **Korean Air** partnership provides a clear commercialization pathway. ### Looking Ahead Investors will be closely watching **Archer Aviation's** upcoming earnings report, scheduled for November 6, 2025, for further insights into the company's financial trajectory and operational progress. The partnership with **Korean Air** provides a strong foundation for commercialization in the South Korean market, and the company's relationship with **Stellantis N.V.** (NYSE:STLA) remains a critical factor for scaling manufacturing capabilities. **Archer's** strategy involves a hybrid business model aimed at capturing a larger **eVTOL** market share, which carries both opportunities and risks. The continued progress towards **FAA** certification and the successful execution of its manufacturing and commercialization strategies will be key determinants of its future performance. ## Analyst Price Targets Show Divergence for Exact Sciences **Exact Sciences (EXAS)** has seen a mixed recalibration of analyst price targets, reflecting varied interpretations of the company's strategic initiatives and recent clinical data. While several investment firms have increased their outlook for the diagnostic company, citing robust performance in key product areas, others have adopted a more cautious stance following specific test results. This divergence underscores a dynamic period for **Exact Sciences** as it navigates expansion in the competitive cancer screening market. ## The Event in Detail: Key Data Points and Sector Impact Recent analyst revisions highlight distinct perspectives on **Exact Sciences'** trajectory. **Piper Sandler** increased its price target for **EXAS** to **$70.00** from **$60.00**, maintaining an Overweight rating. This upward adjustment was primarily driven by the sustained strength of the **Cologuard** franchise and anticipated growth in **Cancerguard** and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing. Similarly, **Craig-Hallum** significantly raised its target from **$65.00** to **$85.00**, pointing to the positive implications of the **Freenome** deal, which provides access to a blood-based CRC test pipeline, and promising data from **Shield V2**. Conversely, **TD Cowen** reduced its price target to **$66.00** from **$75.00**, although maintaining a Buy rating. This downward revision was attributed to investor disappointment surrounding the company’s colorectal cancer (CRC) blood test data, despite strong overall quarterly performance. **Barclays** also lowered its price target to **$55.00** from **$65.00** for Guardant Health (GH), a competitor in the diagnostics space, suggesting broader skepticism about long-term changes in the blood-based screening market which could indirectly affect **Exact Sciences**. On November 1, 2025, **EXAS** shares traded with a daily high of **$64.81** and a low of **$62.56**, closing at a previous price of **$63.22**. The trading volume was **2,424,629** shares, slightly above the average volume of **2,347,081**. This places the stock within the range of current analyst targets, which span from **$53** to **$85**. ## Analysis of Market Reaction: Growth Drivers and Persistent Concerns The market's reaction to **Exact Sciences** is being shaped by two primary forces: the continued success and expansion of its established **Cologuard** product line, and the strategic push into new, highly anticipated multi-cancer early detection (MCED) technologies. The **Cologuard** franchise has shown accelerating growth, with a **18%** year-over-year increase, supported by Medicare pricing for **Cologuard Plus** rising **16%** to **$592**. The company's goal to fully transition to **Cologuard Plus** by 2027 and project a **30%** annual growth in rescreening eligibility over the next five years underscores its confidence in this segment. The recent launch of **Cancerguard**, a new MCED blood test, as a laboratory-developed test (LDT) in the U.S., marks a significant expansion. This test boasts **64% sensitivity** across cancers and **97.4% specificity**, and **Exact Sciences** is enrolling **25,000** individuals in the **Falcon study** to support future FDA submissions and coverage. This initiative positions **Exact Sciences** to capitalize on the rapidly expanding global MCED market, estimated to be worth **$1.12 billion** in 2025 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of **17%** through 2030. The announcement saw **EXAS** shares rise **2.2%**, closing at **$56.0**. However, the disappointing colorectal cancer (CRC) blood test data served as a counteracting force, leading to price target reductions from some analysts. This setback highlights the high expectations and intense scrutiny within the blood-based screening segment, where precision and early detection capabilities are paramount. **Exact Sciences** has proactively addressed this by partnering with **Freenome** to access their pipeline, with FDA approval anticipated in 2026 for a new blood-based CRC test. ## Broader Context and Implications: Strategic Vision and Financial Health **Exact Sciences** has reaffirmed its long-term strategic vision, aiming for **15%** compounded annual revenue growth through 2027. The company is also implementing a cost-out program expected to save **$150 million** annually by 2026 and plans to reduce general and administrative expenses to **20%** or below by 2027. These operational efficiencies are critical for sustaining profitability as the company invests in R&D and market expansion. The company's second-quarter 2025 financial performance exceeded analyst expectations, reporting an earnings per share (EPS) of **-$0.01**, significantly better than the forecasted **-$0.13**. Revenue also surpassed projections, reaching **$811.1 million** against an expected **$773.8 million**. This strong financial performance, including a healthy **69% gross profit margin** and **12.6% revenue growth** over the last twelve months, provides a solid foundation despite specific clinical trial disappointments. The company also raised its 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting **$3.13 billion to $3.17 billion**. The competitive landscape for cancer screening remains intense. While **Exact Sciences** advances its **Cancerguard** and **Cologuard** offerings, competitors like **Guardant Health (GH)** are also making strides. **Guardant Health** reported strong Q3 2025 results, with screening revenue on a **$100 million** run rate and oncology revenue increasing **31%** to **$184 million**. Their collaboration with **Quest Diagnostics** for **Shield** testing, expected in Q1 2026, illustrates the broader industry trend toward expanding access and adoption of these advanced diagnostic tools. ## Looking Ahead: Regulatory Milestones and Market Penetration The future performance of **Exact Sciences** will hinge on several key factors. The successful completion and outcomes of the **Falcon study** for **Cancerguard** will be crucial for securing broader insurance coverage and market acceptance. Continued growth in **Cologuard** rescreening eligibility and the successful transition to **Cologuard Plus** will remain vital revenue drivers. Investors will also closely monitor the progress of the **Freenome** collaboration and the anticipated FDA approval of their blood-based CRC test in 2026, which could mitigate concerns raised by **Exact Sciences'** earlier blood test data. Furthermore, the company's ability to achieve its **$150 million** annual cost savings and reduce administrative expenses will be important indicators of its operational efficiency and profitability trajectory in a highly innovative, yet capital-intensive, sector. The overall sentiment will likely remain mixed as the market weighs the significant growth potential of its new offerings against the challenges and competitive pressures in specific diagnostic segments. ## Market Performance Overview **Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd.** (NASDAQ: **CRDO**) shares advanced 21% over the past week, signaling continued investor interest in the semiconductor connectivity solutions provider. This recent appreciation contributes to a remarkable one-year return for shareholders, currently standing at 364%. Institutional investors, holding a substantial stake in the company, have been the primary beneficiaries of these significant gains. ### Institutional Ownership and Influence The ownership structure of **Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd.** indicates a high degree of institutional influence, a factor that can introduce both stability and volatility into the stock's performance. Institutions own the majority of outstanding shares, while individual insiders collectively hold 11%, representing 18,967,751 shares. The general public accounts for 14.7% of ownership, totaling 25,437,976 shares. The concentration of ownership, with the top 19 shareholders collectively owning 50% of the company, suggests that large institutional trading decisions could significantly impact **CRDO**'s stock price. Despite substantial trading activity, shareholders have not experienced significant dilution over the past year. ### Insider Activity and Potential Implications Recent insider trading activity indicates that **CRDO** insiders have exclusively sold shares over the last three months. While insider selling can sometimes be interpreted as a negative signal regarding future prospects, it is important to note that insiders still maintain a considerable 11% ownership stake in the company. This ongoing insider presence could mitigate some concerns, but sustained selling pressure from key stakeholders might temper investor enthusiasm or contribute to price fluctuations. ### Broader Context and Future Outlook The exceptional 364% one-year return positions **Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd.** as a high-performing stock in its sector, reflecting strong market confidence in its business model and growth trajectory. This strong performance, combined with robust institutional interest, indicates a bullish market sentiment for **CRDO**. Looking ahead, the interplay between continued institutional investment and any further insider transactions will be a critical determinant of the stock's near-term performance. Investors will likely monitor institutional movements for indicators of sustained confidence or potential profit-taking, while also observing insider activity for cues on long-term outlook. The high institutional concentration suggests that **CRDO**'s stock may continue to exhibit sensitivity to large-scale portfolio adjustments by these major holders.

Title: The AI-Driven Stock Runup May Not Be As Good As Many Assume
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2025/10/31/the-ai-driven-stock-runup-may-not-be-as-good-as-many-assume/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T03:37:06Z

ByErik Sherman, Senior Contributor. The witching hour. Is this about All Hallow’s Eve? No, it’s about tech companies — AI-focused in particular. Promise, hype, and intra-sector cross-investment has created an interesting dynamic of economic concentration and risk. By no means is this to say that tech companies and their stocks are bad. It also isn’t to say they will be good at all times and past performance is a guarantee of future returns. Technology stocks have shown strong returns, as they have in 2023 and 2024, according to U.S. Bank. The information technology sector gained 23% year-to-date on October 21, 2025. The tech-focused communication services sector gained 25%. In contrast, the S&P 500 increased by 15% and the return for the Nasdaq composite was 19%. More specifically, the so-called Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — comprise 36.6% of the S&P 500 as of October 2025, up from 12.3% in 2015, according to The Motley Fool. In year-to-date performance, the Magnificent Seven had returns of 18.6% compared to 14.5% of the S&P 500. A big reason is due to artificial intelligence growth. Stanford University’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group calculated that corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024. Year-over-year private investment was up 44.5% and mergers and acquisitions, up 12.1%. The current AI and tech success, though, creates some structural issues. “The S&P 500 is built on a ‘survivor bias’ basis, with companies having the most success making up the largest weightings,” Vince Stanzione, former currency trader and CEO of financial publisher First Information, says. The higher the market capitalization of the company, the higher its standing in the S&P 500. Stanzione compared two S&P 500-related exchange-traded funds: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight EFT (RSP) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). “If you compare the equal-weighted RSP to SPY, you will see the equal-weighted is doing poorly, only up around 8% [year-to-date] compared to 17%.” The reason SPY did better is that it includes larger shares of top technology stocks. “It is somewhat worrying to have such high exposure in the S&P 500, and at some stage the sector will correct,” he adds. “For my own trading and clients, we have also had large exposure to mining stocks — which are hardly represented in the SPY — and, even after the recent pullback, this is up 113% YTD and on a far lower [price-earnings ratio] multiple than tech stocks, so there are still opportunities in other sectors. But for those just passively tracking the S&P 500, they remain tech-heavy and will keep dancing until the music stops.” The market excitement over AI is fueled by investor belief on its future. But the concentration of tech acts in a way like leverage in investing. The expectations can pile on atop the other. An example The Motley Fool gave was Nvidia. Since the end of 2015, the company has added trillions to its market cap, moving from the smallest contributor to the Magnificent Seven to the largest. That was a jump from 0.8% of the combined value to the largest at 21.2%. If you have ever seen a juggler balancing a spinning plate on a pole, then you know the plates must keep rotating to maintain their stability. “The current market continues to consolidate with outperformance limited to fewer and fewer stocks, mostly based on the promise of AI and, perhaps more compelling, spending on AI infrastructure,” says Geoff Strotman of investment consulting firm Segal Marco Advisors. “Many of these stocks happen to be the largest stocks in the US stock market (and the largest in history), which is quickly driving performance and valuations higher.” Strotman notes that while the S&P 500 is at “historically high valuation,” there are many other areas of the global stock market — US small caps and non-US stocks — that remain at average valuations. That can mean good returns with lower investment amounts. He adds that emerging markets are having a strong year, up almost 30% year-to-date. “The emerging markets outperformance is also a reminder for institutional investors to remain diversified and rebalance into underperforming asset classes in order to take advantage of return divergence and opportunities as Emerging Markets was just about left for dead at the beginning of the year,” Strotman says. However, concerns about risk from tech, or any other type of stock type, can create its own problems. “The debate over whether AI is a 'boom' or a 'bubble' is interesting, but in reality, it’s a distraction to everyday investors focused on long-term wealth,” says Alex Michalka, head of investments at Weatlthfront. “No one can know the answer for sure, and attempting to adjust your strategy based on a guess is a form of market timing, which historically is not a wise approach. Instead, you’re better off focusing on ensuring you have a well-diversified portfolio that includes the level of risk you’re comfortable with based on your situation and time horizon.” In other words, if technology is an area where you find heightened risk, you don’t need to run away from it. A diversified portfolio is an intelligent investment tool. Michalka mentioned direct indexing, in which you buy individual stocks to imitate an existing stock index like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. You can look for areas of tech that gives some of the upside without being married to it.

Title: Texas And New York Set To Send Contrasting Signals To Investors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2025/10/31/texas-and-new-york-set-to-send-contrasting-signals-to-investors/
Time Published: 2025-11-01T03:30:15Z

ByPatrick Gleason, Contributor. Next Tuesday, November 5, New York City voters are likely to elect a new mayor who has campaigned on income tax hikes for upper-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, that same day, Texas voters are expected to approve ballot measures banning state taxation of capital gains and the imposition of a financial transactions tax. The heightened contrast is sure to help the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), the new Dallas-based stock market set to launch in 2026. An October 31 Wall Street Journal report about a new $90 million commitment to the TXSE from J.P. Morgan, the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase, noted that the TXSE “has billed itself as more CEO-friendly” than the New York Stock Exchange, adding that “previous investors include Citadel Securities, BlackRock and Charles Schwab.” The new infusion from JP Morgan, the WSJ added, “brings TXSE’s total fundraising to date above $250 million.” Ballot propositions banning a state death tax, a financial transactions tax, and a capital gains tax aren’t the only 2025 ballot measures that are set to make Texas an even more attractive destination to live, work, and invest. Texas voters will have the opportunity to enact reforms that provide further tax cuts, particularly property tax relief. Polling shows Texas voters are likely to approve Proposition 13, which will provide property tax relief to Lone Star State residents through a 40% increase in the homestead exemption. The state’s $100,000 homestead exemption would rise to $140,000 if voters enact Proposition 13 next Tuesday. “While not a permanent fix to property taxes, the amendment should help slow the growth of property taxes for all homeowners,” says Texans for Fiscal Responsibility (TFR), who has endorsed Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 seeks to provide relief for all property taxpayers in Texas, Proposition 9 would provide relief from the business personal property tax, commonly referred to as the inventory tax, to small businesses across the state. If approved, Proposition 9 would significantly increase the existing $2,500 inventory tax exemption, raising it to $125,000. “Texas is one of just nine states where small business owners pay taxes on the value of their inventory for sale, their personal property, and everything else used to generate income,” noted the National Federation of Independent Business’s Texas chapter in its statement of support for Proposition 9. NFIB adds that passage of Proposition 9 “would save Texas small businesses over $500 million annually,” and “make Texas even more competitive amongst its neighboring states.” “This constitutional amendment simplifies compliance, reduces bureaucratic costs, and incentivizes productivity,” notes TFR’s analysis of Proposition 9. “It cuts down on burdensome taxation that can stifle economic growth, especially for small operations. This is a pro-growth, pro-business reform that respects taxpayers and limits government overreach.” The ballot measures that Texas voters will likely approve on November 5 underscore why governors and legislative leaders in so many states are pursuing a phaseout of their income tax that would have them join Texas in the club of no-income-tax states. The eight existing no-income-tax states have already demonstrated the economic benefits of avoiding an income tax, and many are now seeking to expand that advantage by making their tax codes even more competitive. Texas isn’t the only no-income-tax state where legislators are pursuing property tax relief. In fact, in no-income-tax Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is now pushing for a full phaseout of property taxes in Florida. In particular, Governor DeSantis is championing a single measure for the 2026 ballot that would begin phasing out all property taxes in Florida. Republicans in the Florida House of Representatives introduced eight property tax relief proposals on October 17, with seven of them being constitutional amendments requiring voter approval in November of 2026. Constitutional amendments must receive approval from at least 60% of voters in order to be enacted. The James Madison Institute, a Florida-based think tank, recently conducted a poll that found 65% of those surveyed said they would support a ballot measure to provide property tax relief. Lawmakers in other states are also pursuing property tax relief or limitation in the coming year. In no-income-tax Tennessee, for example, legislators will seek to pass a bill in 2026 that limits the growth of property tax bills. Tennessee is currently one of only four states without some form of property tax limit on the books. “To provide relief for taxpayers, we must set firm limits on how fast local governments can grow their budgets,” Justin Owen, president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, and John Hendrickson, policy director at Iowans for Tax Relief, wrote in an October 17 article in Governing Magazine. “This will ensure that taxes do not outpace the ability of families and businesses to pay. Taxpayers must be protected from unchecked growth in local government spending.” “Eliminating property taxes may be a noble solution, but tax policy should always be approached with prudence,” Owen and Hendrickson added. “Replacing property taxes with a new tax or raising an existing tax to a higher rate, or even shifting more responsibilities to the state budget, are not necessarily sound tax policies. The best approach to lower taxes is to limit local government spending.” There were already plenty of reasons for lawmakers in no-income-tax states to pursue property tax cuts, property tax limits, and other forms of tax relief. But the case for doing so is strengthened by the fact that, at present, governors and legislators in nearly a dozen states across the country are seeking to phase out their income taxes. As more states eliminate their income tax, the lack of a state income tax will become less of an advantage. Leaders of no-income-tax states — such as Governors Abbott in Texas, DeSantis in Florida, and Lee in Tennessee — have made clear they are not resting on their laurels and that they welcome the competition.

Title: Does Bitcoin Power Law model still work in 2025 after S2F failed?
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/does-the-bitcoin-power-law-model-still-hold-after-stock-to-flow-failed/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T23:00:37Z

The range that matters: $48k floor to $492k top, with the top increasing over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. With S2F in the rearview, the live power-law channel indicates that BTC is roughly 20% below fair value, but ETF flows could push it to either extreme. Bitbo’s implementation of Giovanni Santostasi’s model places the price near $109,700, the fair value near $136,100, the support near $48,300, and the resistance near $491,800, which frames the current cycle within a rising corridor derived from a power-law fit to price over time. The channel is constructed by running a linear regression of log(price) versus log(time since genesis), then duplicating that line in parallel to form upper and lower bounds that have historically contained cyclical extremes. The result is a time-based compounding curve with rails that move upward as time passes, making the model more of a location map than a point forecast. The core claim is simple to evaluate in live markets. Bitcoin trades about 20 percent below the fair-value regression and more than twice above the model’s floor, a mid-zone placement that contrasts with prior cycle tops and bottoms when the price tagged the channel’s resistance or support. Parameterization used by BGeometrics expresses the fair-value curve as P ≈ 1.0117×10^-17 × (days since genesis)^5.82, with a commonly referenced floor at about 0.42 times the curve, which is consistent with the present gap between spot price and Bitbo’s lower rail. The specification includes historical drawdowns while allowing for late-cycle overextensions toward the upper band. The logic behind this approach treats adoption as a power function of time and expects volatility to decay as the network matures, a property that appears as tightening oscillations around the regression line over successive cycles. Recent flows help explain why the price is in the channel’s middle rather than at an extreme. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) drew a record $5.95 billion in net inflows during the week ending October 4, 2025, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $126,000, alongside strong demand for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The following two weeks showed that flows are not a one-way input. CoinShares recorded a swing to $3.17 billion of net inflows, followed by a reversal to $513 million of net outflows, including a single-week Bitcoin outflow of $946 million. Over the last two days alone, $958 million has exited US Bitcoin ETFs, with $290 million leaving BlackRock on October 30. That cadence is consistent with the power-law framing, where transitory demand surges or air pockets push price toward the upper or lower rails over weeks, while the long-run trajectory is anchored to the time-based power curve. October highs were tied to the breakout wave of ETF subscriptions, which are now a visible macro lever for crypto demand. The forward question, therefore, is not whether the power-law structure still applies, but where within the channel Bitcoin will trade over the next leg. A base-case path keeps the price oscillating around the regression, currently near $136,100, with a dampened amplitude if the volatility decay property holds. A bull-case path would see continued ETF inflows and benign macro conditions pull the price toward the upper resistance, near $491,800 today, which prior cycles reached during late-stage runs. A bear-case scenario would arise from macro tightening, a regulatory shock, or persistent ETF outflows that drive a retest of the lower rail near $48,300. This level has historically seen capitulation wicks before reentry into the channel. These levels rise with time as the exponent on days since genesis compounds. The rails are directional guardrails, not fixed targets. For readers tracking levels at a glance, the live model ranges are: PlanB’s S2F path called for $98,000 by November 2021 and $135,000 by December 2021, targets that were not met. The price then spent years below the S2F trajectory, an out-of-sample failure that weakened confidence in using a univariate stock-to-flow ratio to set deterministic targets. Vitalik Buterin has criticized S2F for providing false precision, and many analysts have identified methodological issues, including overfitting, the omission of demand and liquidity variables, and the treatment of halvings as step-wise valuation shifts that do not account for market microstructure. Institutional researchers continue to caution that S2F is not a reliable tool for long-term pricing. That leaves S2F as a scarcity narrative rather than a forecasting model. Power-law adherents, by contrast, argue that the cycle length and amplitude can be bounded without hard-dating outcomes. CryptoSlate has previously outlined broad windows in which Bitcoin would not sustain prices below roughly six figures after 2028 and could, at some point between 2028 and 2037, touch the seven-figure mark. Those are ranges, not calendar calls, and they inherit the same caveats as any model that ignores policy shocks or structural changes in market access. The new structural change is ETF flow, which functions as a demand valve that can overpower the marginal issuance cuts that halvings encode. Sustained weekly spot inflows above $2 billion to $3 billion would raise the odds of an upper-band test, while persistent outflows would increase the probability of a regression or floor retest. Macro liquidity, including the path of rates, the dollar, and central bank balance sheets, still takes center stage in determining whether the price holds above the regression or drifts toward the lower rail. That macro overlay is absent in S2F and is only indirectly present in the power-law fit, which is why practitioners track flows and policy alongside the channel. The power-law channel is constructed by taking daily BTCUSD closes, transforming them to log(price) versus log(time since genesis), fitting a simple linear regression as the fair-value curve, and then copying that line up and down in parallel to form resistance and support that historically enclose the price. The elegance lies in its production of a monotonically rising, time-based framework with a visible margin of error, which, so far, has captured cycle extremes without claiming to know the date or magnitude of future blow-offs. The cost is that it does not mechanistically incorporate known drivers, such as ETF demand or liquidity cycles, which must be monitored to understand where within the channel price is likely to reside in the near term. For now, the live read is straightforward. Price sits about one-fifth below the regression, well above the floor, with ETF flows and macroeconomic conditions determining whether Bitcoin tags the upper band or fades toward support before reverting to the mean. The channel continues to rise with time, and the rails define the tradable map. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Amazon led the stock market on Friday, with shares jumping 9.6%, to the finish of another winning week and month. The Dow rose 40.75 points, or 0.1%, to 47,562.87, finishing the week up 0.8%. The S&P 500 rose 17.86 points, or 0.3%, to 6,840.20, ending the week with a 0.7% increase. The Nasdaq rose 143.81 points, or 0.6%, to 23,724.96, climbing 2.2% for the week. The online retailer was by far the strongest upward force on the market reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts' expectations, per the AP. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for Amazon's cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace not seen since 2022. The company's size, roughly $2.4 trillion, means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company's. Without Amazon, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Apple had less effect on the market even though it's bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Tim Cook said Apple benefited from strong revenue for its iPhones and its services offerings, which include its app store.

Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, giving nine shares to investors for each one they own. They helped offset a drop for AbbVie, which fell 4.5% even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit than expected. Additional drops on Friday of 1.5% for Microsoft and 2.7% for Meta were the heaviest weights on the US market.

Title: AI Didn’t Layoff 14,000 People. Amazon Did.

ByAnn Kowal Smith, Contributor. Amazon cut 14,000 jobs this week, citing, in part, efficiency gains from AI. But blaming AI for layoffs is like blaming the thermometer for the fever. AI didn’t eliminate these jobs. Amazon did. Its leaders did. And they’re not alone. Across the tech giants, AI isn’t making these decisions—it’s masking them. Efficiency has become the new moral alibi—Microsoft, Meta, Google, and many others have all cited AI as justification for thousands of cuts. Every time leaders make a human decision and hide behind a technical one, they erode something far more valuable than headcount. They erode trust. The language of “AI gains” has become a convenient disguise for an old reflex: cut now, justify later. Leaders once blamed “the market.” They blamed Wall Street. Then automation. Today they blame AI. We’ve found the perfect scapegoat—one that never talks back. And efficiency becomes the virtue that absolves the decision. The further leaders move from the people affected by their decisions, the easier it becomes to treat humans as inputs rather than individuals. Data becomes a shield against empathy. AI doesn’t make these choices, but it makes it easier to hide from them. That’s the new face of moral outsourcing—not machines taking over judgment, but humans abdicating it. Here’s the irony: the productivity miracle AI promised hasn’t yet arrived. A recent MIT study found that despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment in generative AI, 95 percent of companies have seen no measurable return. Only five percent of pilots are delivering meaningful financial impact. If the payoff isn’t here, what exactly are we optimizing? The truth is, companies aren’t chasing performance, they’re shifting their bets. As GlobalData’s Neil Saunders observed, “In some ways, this is a tipping point away from human capital to technological infrastructure.” The story isn’t about productivity. It’s about where investment is flowing and what’s being left behind. Amazon’s own numbers tell the story clearly. The company isn’t shrinking because AI made it leaner. It’s shrinking to pay for AI. Net sales are up double digits year over year, and operating income topped $18 billion last quarter. Yet free cash flow has fallen from $53 billion to $18 billion in a year, driven largely by record spending on data centers, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure. Amazon is cutting costs today to fund the AI infrastructure that might, someday, deliver results tomorrow. Efficiency, pursued for its own sake, stops serving people and starts consuming them. From Microsoft to Meta, Google to Dell, the same logic echoes: cut people now to finance the systems to eventually replace them. The question isn’t whether AI will make us more productive. It’s what we’ll have sacrificed by the time it does. Each algorithmic layoff widens the distance between leaders and the people they lead. It doesn’t just trim headcount. It thins the thread of trust that holds organizations together. The stock market is booming. Yet, in the U.S. alone, nearly 700,000 job cuts were announced in the first half of 2025, up 80% over the same period last year. Every time an organization maximizes profits and machines over people, the social contract that binds workplaces together is collateral damage. It used to be that if you were smart, worked hard, and loyal to your company, they were loyal to you. Those days are disappearing. Now we ask laid off workers to pay the price for oversized payrolls, while the leaders move forward unaffected. It’s unrealistic to suggest that a company can never downsize, that it can’t restructure itself to meet the needs of a disruptive technology. But when people are involved, the “how” matters. When an automotive supplier found itself in a similar pickle, needing to reduce its workforce by 30% to stay afloat, its leaders charted a different path. Instead of mass layoffs, they offered voluntary retirement plans, each with generous severance, and met their reduction needs organically. Preserving everyone’s dignity, those who left and those who stayed remained deeply committed to the company and its success. You can’t innovate in a climate of fear. And more than half of workers now fear losing their jobs in the next year. People stop taking risks. They comply. They play it safe. Ironically, at the dawn of the AI era, we’re engineering the conditions least conducive to innovation. At its highest and best use, AI could help us cure cancer, rebuild infrastructure, even reverse climate damage. But we may throw that future away. Not because machines failed us, but because we did. It doesn’t have to be this way. AI isn’t inherently dehumanizing. It’s a mirror, reflecting the values of those who build and wield it. LinkedIn’s Aneesh Raman envisions a new “relationship economy,” one where social intelligence sits at the center of work. “Human ideas are the new code,” he says. “Human energy is the new data center. And a new world of work anchored on the human brain is about to emerge.” It’s an inspiring vision—one we could realize, or ruin—depending on how we use the power in our hands. Octavia Butler captured this paradox decades ago in her evocative short story, The Book of Martha, where God asks a woman to redesign humanity to save the world. Every solution she imagines creates a new harm. The story ends not with certainty, but humility. That’s the leadership lesson AI demands: every “efficiency” we celebrate carries consequences we can’t yet see. Every act of progress leaves a shadow, and real wisdom lies in seeing both. As AI moves closer to the center of decision-making, leadership’s job is to keep accountability in human hands. The future of work won’t be written by bots. It will be written in the daily decisions leaders make about people. Taking responsibility begins with owning those choices. Leaders should state plainly what was decided, why it was decided, and who is accountable. Transparency is the first antidote to moral outsourcing. It also requires re-humanizing the data. Every data point represents a person, a livelihood, a story. Before optimizing, leaders should ask who is affected, what relationships might be broken, and what trust might be lost. Data without dialogue degrades judgment. And finally, responsibility means measuring what truly matters. Not just productivity or profit, but belonging, learning, and creativity—the conditions that make innovation possible. In an age obsessed with speed, these are the slow variables that determine whether progress endures. If we want AI to serve humanity, we must first take responsibility for the humans we lead. Committed employees need a committed employer. It’s a social contract grounded in mutual trust. Amazon’s layoffs aren’t just another round of cost-cutting—they’re a warning to every company chasing the same playbook. When the world’s most powerful firms reduce people simply to expand their AI budgets, they send a clear signal about the future of work: speed over stewardship, profits over people, efficiency over empathy. The short-term gain is easy to count; the long-term cost isn’t. It won’t appear on a balance sheet. It will surface later, in the trust we squander, the talent we silence, and the future we forfeit. The danger isn’t artificial intelligence. It’s artificial leadership.

Title: Amazon cutting 760 corporate jobs in Southern California

Amazon, which announced plans this week to reduce its global corporate workforce by about 14,000 jobs, says it is laying off 760 jobs in Southern California beginning in January as part of a shakeup driven by artificial intelligence. Overall, Amazon says it will cut 1,540 positions in California — including 783 in Northern California, according to Vani Appukkutty, a senior manager in the company’s human resources department. In Southern California, layoffs are coming to Irvine (333), Culver City (152), San Diego (145) and Santa Monica (130). Also see: Disneyland lays off about 100 salaried employees The layoffs begin Jan. 26 and finish by April 1, Appukkutty wrote in Oct. 28 letters filed with the state’s Employment Development Department. “Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent,” she wrote. The filings were made as part of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act — commonly referred to as WARN — which are required when an employer lays off more than 50 employees. All affected employees are notified at least 60 days before their terminations are scheduled to occur, according to Appukkutty. The layoffs include positions for business intelligence, data, software and security engineers, contract managers, creative marketers, financial analysts, game artists and designers, lawyers, product managers, tax analysts and other administrative staff, according to the EDD letters. More job cuts: Santa Monica-based RAND cuts 11% of its workforce Appukkutty did not provide reasons for the layoffs or where in the tech giant the reductions would happen. However, news reports said that Amazon.com was gutting its video-game division in Irvine, San Diego and its central publishing division. The retailer also announced Oct. 3 that it would close four of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in Southern California by mid-November as it reevaluates store performance. Beth Galetti, senior vice president in charge of Amazon’s human resources department, wrote in an Oct. 28 blog post that artificial intelligence is enabling companies to “innovate much faster than ever before.” In announcing the 14,000 corporate layoffs, Galetti wrote that Amazon is convinced of the “need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” She said that the reductions are a continuation of the work to get even “stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources” to invest in Amazon’s future. The corporate layoffs mean “reducing in some areas and hiring in others,” she added. For instance, Amazon announced in early October that it planned to fill 30,000 new seasonal roles across California, including up to 8,000 roles in Riverside, San Bernardino and Ontario — as well as up to 3,000 roles for the upcoming holidays across Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim, and 1,300 roles in San Diego, Chula Vista and Carlsbad. Many of the seasonal roles have the potential to transition into year-round employment with benefits, said Amazon spokeswoman Carly Levy in an Oct. 14 statement.Related Articles 2 Amazon Fresh grocery stores are closing in Orange County

Title: BlackRock's Larry Fink says US still top destination for global investors to park money

Tortoise Capital’s Rob Thummel and Payne Capital Management’s Ryan Payne join Mornings with Maria to discuss record market highs, the AI infrastructure boom and how Big Tech earnings and U.S.–China trade talks could drive investor sentiment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. remains the primary destination for investors to put their assets and will continue to be for at least the next year and a half amid economic trends. Fink was part of a panel moderated by Bloomberg Television at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia and noted that earlier this year there was "modest transformation and movement out of the dollar" as investors moved assets to Europe and other regions. However, he noted that movement came from a "huge overweight in dollar-based assets" and that the trend appears to be reversing with investors moving back into U.S. assets. "I would say in the last two months we're seeing that money coming back into the U.S., so I don't see there's that much movement. There's still a deep belief in the opportunity in the U.S.," Fink said, noting the surge in investment related to AI and other capital projects. BLACKROCK'S BRAGGING RIGHTS TO FASTEST-GROWING ETFS BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. will continue to be a destination for investors to be "overweight" for at least the next 18 months. (Kirk Sides/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) "Over 40% of the economic growth in the second quarter was capex for technology, and you don't see that in other places in the world," the BlackRock chief said. "And it's that capex, whether it's data centers or finding more power, gas, building gas turbines – you're seeing all that happening more in the U.S. than in most places in the world today." "You're not seeing that as much in Europe, and this is one of the big reasons for the huge gap between U.S. GDP and European GDP," he added. BLACKROCK CEO LARRY FINK'S ANNUAL LETTER TO INVESTORS Fink said that while money will continue to move around to different countries and regions of the world, he thinks most global investors will continue to focus on being overweight on their U.S. investments for the next year and a half. "Money's going to move around all the time, but I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the U.S. and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink added. U.S. markets tumbled earlier this year amid concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the economy, as well as longstanding fiscal issues. TRUMP AND XI STRIKE TRADE TRUCE: 5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE SOUTH KOREA SUMMIT U.S. markets have rebounded on strong AI investment after sliding earlier this year in the wake of tariff announcements. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images) President Donald Trump's announcement of his "reciprocal" tariff policy in early April prompted a significant sell-off in the stock market – though the administration later delayed and pared back some of those tariff policies, which reduced investors' concerns. Longstanding concerns over the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. have also continued to accumulate as the deficit has surpassed the $37 trillion and $38 trillion thresholds over the course of 2025. Concerns about the inability of lawmakers to curtail persistent and growing budget deficits prompted Moody's to become the third major ratings agency to downgrade the U.S. credit rating from its top tier.

Hinch have hit form with back-to-back wins, including a superb victory away to Cork Constitution, and are looking to cement their title credentials. Terenure, winners over Nenagh Ormond last week, have been strong again this term and will look to continue their push near the summit. Clontarf face UCD at Castle Avenue in an all-Dublin derby. The reigning champions have won three in a row and look every inch a side intent on going back-to-back this season. UCD, ninth with one win, will need to produce something special to upset the champions. Lansdowne welcome bottom side Nenagh Ormond to the Aviva back pitch, while unbeaten leaders St Mary’s College host Cork Constitution in a rematch of last season’s semi-final. Young Munster, still searching for their first victory despite four losing bonus points, take on Old Belvedere in Limerick. Division 1B has tightened considerably, with Blackrock College rediscovering form after a slow start. They host second-placed City of Armagh, who could go top with another victory. Dublin University meet leaders Instonians at College Park in a top-four battle between two in-form sides. Garryowen and Old Wesley clash in Dooradoyle, while a local Cork derby between Highfield and UCC offers both sides a chance to reignite their campaigns. At Dub Lane, Queen’s University chase a first win against Naas after several narrow defeats, the Kildare side meanwhile aim to record back-to-back wins. In Division 2A, leaders MU Barnhall and Dungannon remain the only unbeaten teams. Barnhall welcome bottom side Banbridge to Parsonstown, while Dungannon face Cashel in Spafield. Division 2B features a standout Connacht derby as unbeaten Galwegians face Sligo at Crowley Park, while UL Bohemian put their perfect record on the line away to Clogher Valley.

Title: Is the job market frozen or faltering?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Layoffs raise alarms while young workers eye law school They call it the Great Freeze. That’s how some analysts describe the U.S. job market recently — a “low-hire, low-fire” environment where workers who have jobs are not losing them but finding a new job is difficult. But a thaw may be coming. A “slew” of “large-scale layoffs” may be a sign that the labor market is “starting to tip over,” said Axios. Amazon announced it will slash 14,000 jobs, UPS said it was cutting 48,000 positions, and Paramount said it was laying off 1,000 workers. The unemployment rate had hovered around 4% for more than a year, but that “apparent stability” has concealed “change beneath the surface.” Now, companies appear ready to “take advantage of the potential of AI to transform work.” This could mean fewer jobs for humans. The massive layoffs suggest the job market’s “current state of suspension has changed for the worse,” said MarketWatch. While companies are still comfortably profitable, they are waiting on the “dust to settle” from tariff negotiations, the government shutdown and the corporate adoption of AI. Amazon’s layoffs could be the tipping point. “We may see others join the fray,” said John Challenger, the CEO of career-services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Escape your echo chamber.

The job market “could get ugly,” Dan DeFrancesco said at Business Insider. “About 20 more Amazon-sized layoffs” would upend the labor market. That scenario is “not out of the realm of possibility” because “companies are known to follow the lead of their bigger peers.” Meta’s 2022 layoff of 11,000 workers led to a much larger wave of tech sector job cuts. American companies have recently been in a “holding pattern,” but if they start to let workers go without replacing them, the “somewhat resilient job market could start to show some real cracks.” “The labor market is undeniably going through a transition,” Adam Hardy said at Money. Young workers are “canaries in the coal mine” since they are often the first to feel job market instability, and “young workers and recent college grads aren’t doing so well” at the moment. AI is often blamed, but there are other factors. Right now, there are “more graduates than there are jobs that require grads.” That’s a challenge that predates the rise of AI by “several years.” The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point this week to “shore up the softening job market,” said NPR. On top of private sector layoffs, the federal government has already cut about 100,000 jobs this year. American employment “may well be shrinking already,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier in October. Bad news for the job market might be good news for graduate programs. “Applications are on the rise” at law schools and MBA programs, said Fortune, with law school applications up 3% over last year. Gen-Z job seekers are buying “more time to figure out what’s next” instead of “facing the bleak job market head-on.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Joel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

Title: Crypto’s second wave of ETFs arrives, investors snap up new Solana offering
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/31/cryptos-second-wave-of-etfs-arrives-investors-snap-up-new-solana-offering/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T17:01:49Z

A flurry of new crypto spot ETFs launched on Tuesday and Wednesday, meaning that mom-and-pop investors can now invest more easily in lesser-known cryptocurrencies. Until this week, these investors could only buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF form, and based on initial demand, at least one of the new offerings is off to a roaring start. The new ETF provides exposure to Solana, the sixth most popular cryptocurrency. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) had the best ETF launch of 2025 in any asset class. Demand for other new ETFs, providing exposure to Litecoin and Hedera, was more muted. Although crypto exchanges like Coinbase have long sold these cryptocurrencies, the ETF wrappers mean investors can get exposure to these assets in the form of shares purchased through any brokerage. “For investors, this is about as McDonald’s easy as you can get,” said Balchunas in an interview with Fortune. “It’s low-cost, easy, and safe.” The launch of this latest crop of ETFs comes nearly two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission first opened the door to crypto funds in January 2024. That’s when the agency finally approved a bid by BlackRock and others to sell Bitcoin ETFs, following a nearly decade-long legal battle with the crypto industry. The first Ethereum ETFs launched later that year. Now, with the launch of ETFs for more obscure cryptocurrencies, traders will have access to an even deeper array of digital assets. On Thursday, BSOL, the Solana ETF issued by crypto asset management firm Bitwise, saw $46 million of trading volume in its third day. By contrast, the Canary Hedera and Litecoin ETFs saw roughly $2.3 million and $500,000, respectively, in their third day. “BSOL did phenomenally well,” said Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise, in an interview with Fortune. “And I think it connected with a lot of investor demand.” Other issuers to launch Solana and Hedera ETFs are Grayscale and Canary, respectively. The race to launch new cryptocurrency ETFs is competitive, as first movers are better able to cultivate investor loyalty and gain a leg up on competitors who are slower to come to market. “It’s like the Ricky Bobby quote, ‘If you’re not first, you’re last,’” said Balchunas. “There’s a little of that in the ETF world. That’s why there’s such a rush to market.” The quest for a crypto ETF dates back to as early as 2013, when the Winklevoss twins —whose legal battle with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg was popularized in the movie The Social Network—sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which track the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, became a white whale for those in the sector. But, under multiple administrations, the SEC rejected applications for them, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. In 2021, the agency approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, but not a spot fund. In 2022, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, sued the agency for allowing futures-based but not spot funds. Grayscale won the case in August 2023. In 2024, a select few spot ETFs launched to record success. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted $70 billion in total assets more quickly than any other ETF. Its Ethereum fund (ETHA) also set record inflows. Under the Trump administration, the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs flew open after the SEC updated its guidance in July. But the recently launched ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin appear to make use of new guidance that the SEC issued at the start of the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the exact technicalities of how these issuers were justifying the listing of their new funds were unclear to Balchunas, he said that they were being opportunistic. “These issuers are very crafty. They found phrasing in guidance put out by the SEC about what to do in the shutdown,” he added. Balchunas also predicted that XRP, the fifth biggest cryptocurrency, would be the next crypto ETF to launch. “If I had to bet $1,000, I would say it would launch a couple of weeks after the government comes back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon says it didn't cut people because of money. But because of 'culture'

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy’s explanation for why the company is cutting 14,000 employees? Not money. Not even AI, but “culture.” The layoff announcement ﻿this week was “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now. It’s culture,” Jassy said in response to an analyst question on the company’s earnings call Thursday. Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion. Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.” Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings. “It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.” Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers. Amazon (AMZN) shares climbed 13% after-hours following the earnings report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Amazon VP says his division is hiring and promoting based on employees' AI usage

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Want to get ahead in Amazon's home security unit? You'd better be using AI. In July, Business Insider viewed an email from Jamie Siminoff, Amazon's VP of product who runs the home security division. In it, Siminoff said that all promotion applications would require employees to list how they were using AI. Siminoff doubled down on that position in an interview with Business Insider last week while promoting his book "Ding Dong." "I would go even deeper than that," Siminoff said. "We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job." Siminoff said that he wants to incentivize his team to use the technology more. "The promotion process is the only real incentive that I can give to a team, because that's how they're going to get paid," he said. "If you are creating more leverage for the company than everyone else, then yeah, that should be how you get promoted." Siminoff spoke with Business Insider before Amazon cut 14,000 jobs on Tuesday. On a recent earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said the layoffs were "not really financially driven," nor were they "really AI-driven, not right now at least," but they were rather about "culture." Siminoff declined to provide an additional comment after the layoffs. At the time of Business Insider's July reporting on Jassy's memo, an Amazon representative said that the change to promotional applications did not apply to the whole company, only to those in the RBKS division — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk. Siminoff cofounded Ring, the video doorbell and home security company. He pitched the "Shark Tank" investors in 2013 but walked away without a deal. Five years later, the company was acquired by Amazon for over $1 billion. After leaving Amazon in 2023, Siminoff returned in his new role as VP of product in April 2025. He refocused Ring on crime-fighting and home security, and added more AI features to the product lineup. In his interview with Business Insider, Siminoff also said that he was asking about AI usage during hiring interviews: "AI in, AI out. It is like a broken record." Asked what an AI-related interview question might sound like, Siminoff said it differed between roles. For example, an engineer might be asked which tools they know how to use, he said. "I think it's the mentality of: are you leaning into AI first?" Siminoff said. "We don't want someone who's like, 'Oh, AI, I know how to use that, I'll use it if you tell me to.'" The ideal candidate already uses tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to solve daily problems, he added. "You're thinking that way natively," Siminoff said. "That's the people I want now." Jump to

Title: Meta Stock Had Its Worst Day In Three Years Due to AI Overspending Worries

The same week that Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company, significantly propelled by its AI-related investments and products, Meta’s stock had its worst day in three years because traders fear that Meta has overspent on AI. As CNBC reports, Meta shares dropped more than 11% on Thursday and have thus far dropped another 1.3% so far today, as of writing. At its bottom yesterday, October 30, Meta’s share price reached its lowest point in three years. Meta, like many tech companies, is frantically racing to improve its AI technology and tools. The stock market fears that Meta’s aggressive capital expenditures on AI are perhaps too aggressive and are arguably unlikely to pay off. During an earnings call on Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the company’s AI spending, which is a huge chunk of overall annual capital expenditures nearing $72 billion. “It’s pretty early, but I think we’re seeing the returns in the core business. That’s giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we’re not underinvesting,” Zuckerberg said during the call. Meta is far from alone in its massive AI spending. CNBC notes that Alphabet, Google’s parent company, increased its projected expenditures to $93 billion, while Microsoft indicated that it also expects to spend more this year than in 2024. Although Meta had a disastrous day yesterday, its stock value is still up over 9.5% so far in 2025. Nonetheless, as MarketWatch wrote yesterday, “There’s an AI bubble.” There are many failed AI startups, and spending is unsustainable. However, MarketWatch argues that the biggest players, including Meta, are “essentially unassailable.” The economics publication claims that these companies are so big, and their core businesses so successful, that even “extended periods of disappointing AI returns” won’t sink the ships. This aligns, at least in part, with what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week. As reported by Fortune, Powell claims that most of the AI-related spending is being done by successful companies with actual earnings, rather than speculative spenders. Powell says the AI bubble, if there is one, is not like the dot-com bubble. But massive companies have failed before, sometimes in catastrophic fashion. Whether investors’ worst fears may be realized, there is clearly a general uneasiness about how at least some companies, including massive ones, are approaching AI.

UPDATE: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is revising the company's explanation for its mass layoffs this week, which could be frustrating for the 14,000 people who lost their jobs. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven—not right now, at least," Jassy said on a Thursday earnings call. "It’s culture." Jassy says Amazon's growth in the past few years left it with too many people, locations, and types of businesses. He reiterated the company's desire to operate like "the world's largest startup, [which] means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly." That partially conflicts with the memo Amazon published on the day it announced layoffs. Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, also mentioned being the "world's largest startup" and stressed the "importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership." However, Galetti also specifically called out a desire to keep up with fast-moving AI technologies. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," she wrote. "We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business." Amazon stock is surging today, up 12% after it reported stellar Q3 earnings, beating expectations, CNBC reports. Original Story 10/28:Amazon today confirmed plans to lay off 14,000 people in corporate roles amid a continued push on AI, though more cuts could be in store for 2026. The company is "reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets," Beth Galetti, head of HR at Amazon, wrote in a company-wide email that it also published online. Galetti's memo comes after Reuters reported yesterday that Amazon planned to cut "as many as 30,000 corporate jobs." She didn't address that number, but said Amazon expects to find "additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains" next year. Reuters reports the cuts will primarily affect those in HR, devices, services, and operations. Employees will hear today if they are affected. Amazon will offer "most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally." Those who cannot find a new role at Amazon will receive "transition support, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more," Galetti says. Some are already posting about being laid off on social media. "After years of pouring my heart into this company and its people, it’s surreal to say that this chapter is now closed," a senior recruiter with Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios wrote on LinkedIn. Usually this type of corporate cut would occur when a company is doing poorly, but Amazon had $18 billion in profit in the latest quarter, The New York Times reports. It's also increased spending on AI data centers. Amazon acknowledged this in its employee memo, citing its ambitions to move even faster in AI. "Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well," Galetti wrote. "What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)." Amazon plans to "operate like the world's largest startup," she added, a phrase CEO Andy Jassy first used in a September 2024 memo to employees in which he also announced a "bureaucracy mailbox," where employees could forward examples of "where we might have bureaucracy or unnecessary process that’s crept in and we can root out." Amazon also laid off approximately 27,000 people a few years ago. As of July, it had 1.55 million employees. Last week, Meta cut 600 roles within its AI division, also citing the need to move faster, so even those who work in AI might not be safe in today's unpredictable tech climate. Last week, The New York Times reported that Amazon would ramp up the use of automation in its warehouses in the coming years, which would allow it to hire about 600,000 fewer human employees. Amazon pushed back on that characterization, however, and pointed to the 250,000 seasonal jobs it will once again add for the holiday rush.

The Site Happy Halloween and all that… and on a Friday no less. Stay safe out there. As for the site, both long time readers might recall me complaining endlessly about how changing the time setting of the blog from UTC to US Pacific time changed my posting streak, which began on March 29, 2020, which would be 2,042 days ago, to starting in May 2023 because the time zone change put one post or another into a different day. I used to post at all hours of the day and night. I mostly used to post at 17:15 UTC, or 10:15 local time, which somehow got converted oddly. Anyway, after bitching about it for well over a year, I finally did something about it. I went back and correct some times… because it turns out that WP.com did some odd things to times when I did that change… to see if, you know, that might actually work. And it did. Granted, it didn’t work in one fell swoop. I basically had to go to the next date that got screwed up and fix the times there, so my streak count went from 857 to 987 to 1252, to whatever, as I worked my way back, day by day, to each screw up. And it was strange, because there were, in fact, no day gaps so far as I could tell. It just freaked out about some times that were past 18:00 around the DST changes. So, basically, bad WP.com code. But I got there. The TAGN Streak – Battlefield 2042 Does this really matter? Am I a better person because WP.com now correctly displays my post streak? Or does this really say more about my own mental defects? Yeah, you probably know the answer better than I. Meanwhile, in comment comedy this month, I have had a repeat commenter from Portland, Oregon (judging from his IP address… remember kids, I can see that) who keeps complaining about my blog appearing on their Kindle and asking that I remove my content from their device. Please.remove this web sight from my kindle At first I thought this was a joke, but it has come up a few times. And I can’t really help them. I recall that there is some minimal browser available on the Kindle, but how things get bookmarked or whatever, no idea. I use the Kindle app on the iPad. One Year Ago LOTRO, EverQuest, and EverQuest II all announced their coming expansions so close together that I just put them all in a single post. Blizzard kicked off the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary festivities. I was asking, not for the first time, when WoW Classic should end. Is there a point when it just isn’t “classic” anymore, or are we on the ride to catch up to retail? Actually in the game, the instance group was still working through Cataclysm Classic, taking on The Lost City of Tol’vir, with a bit of Coren Direbrew on the side. We were also out there with many others farming Wintergrasp for honor. Tol Barad was just bad. Wintergrasp was generally an Alliance walk over, unless we pulled the Horde pre-made group. Then we got worked. We also cheesed the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, because why not? Then we started testing the waters for heroic Deadmines. That was getting us to the end of the expansion so far as we were concerned, so I was wondering how much longer the whole thing would drag on. (Until July 2025, which was too damn long for me.) In EVE Online, the Crimson Harvest event, one of only two regular annual events at this point, kicked off once more. The candidate list for the CSM19 elections was announced, so the campaigning could begin in earnest. Shortly thereafter Alcoholic Satan was removed from CSM18 and dropped from the CSM19 ballot. It isn’t a realm CSM if there isn’t some drama. Then the election started. (And the Alliance Tournament kicked off as well.) When the polls closed we got the results and saw who would be on CSM19. We also got a date for the upcoming Revenant expansion. There was also the MER, which seemed to indicate we were coming out of the “summer slump,” if you believe in that. I did a Friday bullet points post with more about the AT, more Revenant details, the announcement of the Empires of EVE: Vol III project, the current PLEX price crisis (not helped by Torvald Uruz destroying 38,400 PLEX as part of his dramatic rage quit), EVE Galaxy Conquest, and finally getting my 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition delivered (18 months after the 20th anniversary). Then, as the month closed out, CCP finally forced everybody into mandatory participation with the Equinox sov changes. Yay, rejuvenation or something. Actually in New Eden, there was a State of the Goonion meeting that announced our Migration from Delve to Tenerifis. Let the big move begin! This seemed to dismay and confuse PanFam leadership, who had barely fought back claiming that Goons would get tired and go home. The Reavers SIG also celebrated a decade of not existing. The actual move was being handled by stages, with everybody getting to the regional gate between Querious and Catch. (And when I write “everybody” I mean maybe 40% of the alliance. People were still panic moving months later.) Then there was a massive op for crossing the regional gate. And then more move ops. More ops all the time. I also went on my own side adventure, avoiding the regional gate as I moved a black ops battleship and a blockade runner through an alternate route. This all led to Brave finally taking 1DQ1-A and being declared the winner of World War Bee. The Stars Reach pre-alpha carried on with a test of some new tools, then there was a test for combat and new ranger skills, I tried out Galaxicus, the spiritual successor to Stellar Emperor / MegaWars 3. Also, our binge watching habits continued, with another post summarizing what we had been watching. Five Years Ago I started using that 34″ ultra-wide monitor. Coincidentally, I also started complaining about the UI in games being too small and hard to read if they lacked a reasonable scaling option. Somebody at Google Stadia was ranting about making streamers pay. Is there something in the water that makes people this dumb? Blizzard delayed the Shadowlands expansion. But they were building up for the AQ war supply event in WoW Classic. And we got a late November launch date before the month was out. WoW seemed to be hanging on according to the Q3 2020 results. I was also wondering if we were going to get a level squish with every WoW expansion going forward. And then the big level squish patch hit and all our level 120 characters were suddenly level 60. The only thing was to try it out, though it was a bit strange. The new Exile’s Reach starter area was… new. We put together a little group to try the level squished Northrend. Ula made us an instance group video about our time in Sunken Temple. Then there was the running of the Gnomes. And then we started some prep for a little instance called Blackrock Depths. Meanwhile, StarCraft II fell off of Blizzard’s active development list. The EverQuest team announced the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the EverQuest II team announced the Reign of Shadows expansion, and the Lord of the Rings Online launched their War of Three Peaks expansionette. And in EVE Online World War Bee was in full swing, with PAPI finally trying to gain a foothold in Mother Delve. That led to Guinness World Record setting battles, which CCP got us ready for by introducing a UI Only mode to the game. That was some timing. I’ll sum up the war as a list: And outside of the war I did a bit of quiet mining in the new ore distribution plan. The Reavers SIG turned six years old. We got a Crimson Harvest event for Halloween. The Howling Interdictors update gave us stasis bubbles. And then there were the Triglavians. They captured 27 empire systems and, with another update, they were yanked into a new Triglavian region named Pochven. Farewell Niarja. Sean Connery, the favorite James Bond of many, passed away. Finally, there was the tale of the Canadian visitor. Ten Years Ago I opened up the month with a post about the Mineserver Kickstarter campaign, a little box that promised to make hosting easy! A pity is never came to anything… and that I basically threw money into nothing. Then there was the now perennial complaint about customers being too cheap to by any and every 99 cent game. It is because your 99 cent game sucks. In EverQuest II, the Desert of Flames expansion unlock votes passed on Stormhold and Deathtoll, which made me ponder the pacing of nostalgia. Daybreak seemed to want to go faster. Daybreak also have expansion announcements for EverQuest and EverQuest II that included pricey special editions. Milk ’em while you got ’em I guess. But PlanetSide 2 was having problems attracting subscribers. EverQuest II was consolidating servers, so it was farewell to Crushbone. In Lord of the Rings Online, server consolidation was just getting under way as well. Crowfall was still in development, but had announced some costly RMT castles. Guild Wars 2 launched the Heart of Thorns expansion. I picked up the Reaper of Souls expansion for Diablo III and made it through Act V. My wife and I went to EVE Vegas where we partied and heard about the planned Citadel expansion. I brought some give-aways for the trip, which I covered, along with Pirate’s Little Helper, in a Friday bullet points post. Meanwhile, in New Eden I was very impressed with the multi-buy feature that came in with the previous month’s Vanguard release. I was also wondering if space priests were a problem. I also went pipe bombing for the first time. The month’s Blog Banter wanted to know about my PC. And Reavers celebrated their first anniversary. Over in one corner New Eden SpaceMonkeys Alliance (SMA) stole ISK from EVE Online casino I Want ISK who, in turn, hired low sec mercenaries to camp SMA space, starting the embers of what would become the Casino War. And the sad tale of CCP and White Wolf came to an end as CCP sold off the subsidiary and its neglected IP, World of Darkness. Finally, in Minecraft, Aaron began his draining of an ocean monument, and I was interested in bases, several of which sprang up as I worked on the Great Northern Road. Fifteen Years Ago I had some hopes and expectations for BlizzCon. They were pretty much unmet. But Blizzard had already announced the Cataclysm ship date, so what else did I expect? I asked if people ever look at the items in the blog side-bar. People mostly do not. EverQuest launched the House of Thule expansion. I finished building my new computer. Windows 7 64-bit was the wave of the future… unless you wanted to take that LOTRO survey. The EVE Online screen shot contest wrapped up, winners were declared and prizes were sent out. I was playing Lords of Ultima innocently enough and then somebody attacked me! Oh noes! I was suddenly determined to “catch them all” and finish the National Pokedex in Pokemon SoulSilver. The instance group was playing in LOTRO, which had been live as a Free to Play game for one month. In-game, we were subjected to the disturbing habits of some of the residents of the Lone Lands, while I indulged in one of my own habits, the mid-game character swap. And then I made one post completely unreadable by making anagrams out of all the proper nouns. I had to repost a corrected version. I bought Civilization V, which like every Civilization launch, had issues with my current computer. The unwritten rule of Civilization is that you need to upgrade your machine in order for the game to play well. LEGO Universe launched. My daughter and I were drinking new and interesting sodas and I was really hoping that the SF Giants could make it to a World Series victory. Twenty Years Ago Club Penguin, the browser based, kid friendly MMO, launched. Pity about Disney screwing the whole thing up. Civilization IV launched and, as with all Civ launches, the game really needed the next generation of hardware to run in its full glory. I recall submitting a bug and getting a response telling me to stop trying to play with so many civilizations in a single game. Age of Empires III also launched. While it was well reviewed, and we all bought a copy, it never really eclipsed Age of Empires II in my heart. The second game remains the pinnacle of the series for me. Twenty-Five Years Ago The PlayStation 2 launches in North America. Pokemon Gold & Silver arrive in North America. Regional launches were a thing back then. Forty-Five Years Ago Berzerk arrives in arcades. I remember this game showing up and dropping a lot of quarters to play it. It said things.

I managed to get through purple stakes with the checkered deck, the one I find the easiest to run with in that you can go all in on flushes pretty easily. Now I am working on orange stakes, the next to last level… and it is a thing. But it is a rogue-like, which means you just keep starting over until the RNG favors you. EVE Online What did I do in New Eden? Nothing very eventful I guess. I went on a couple of ops, did a bit of the Crimson Harvest event, tended my planets, ratted again a little bit, voted for CSM20, and started accumulating skill points for the Catalyst expansion coming in November. Nothing really exciting, just playing the game in kind of a low key way. No Man’s Sky We might have hit the end of Corvette Summer or whatever. I had already gone back to mostly exploring and the basic game play loop of discovery and moving on. We did try our hand at base building… and it was not very satisfying. I still have more to say about that. Then there was Expedition 20, which Potshot and I both got through, though there were some hurdles as noted. Palia The new game for some of us in the group. Despite it being mostly the housing and crafting portion of an MMO, with scant adventure available, it does press enough of the “progress quest” character advancement buttons without giving you too early on, so you always feel like you are working towards something. We’ll see how long it lasts, but for now it is a pretty chill game. Palworld We’ve been moving slowly here. This has become the Sunday afternoon game, but only if we have the full group. And, being adults with responsibilities and obligations and all that, it doesn’t always come together. But we persist. Pokemon Go The big October update still seems strange to me. Adding new levels to engage you level capped players… and then changing the level curve so that same players just skip past 20 of the 30 levels added… well, it is a bold strategy. So I have xp to get me to level 74 already, we’re just caught up in the tasks required for each of the last ten levels. Coming Up It is the start of the run up to the holidays. It will also be the prime season for high quality ads, so we’ll see if ad revenue for the site goes up. (Please use an ad blocker plugin with your browser. If you’re somebody who reads this far in, I don’t want to tax/annoy you. I want to tax comment spam bots.) In EVE Online we will have the Catalyst expansion coming mid month. That will shake things up a bit; new ships, new login rewards, new Twitch drops and all of that. Enshrouded is also supposed to get its next big update. It was supposed to be this month, but it got pushed out to “October 42nd” according to the community team. Best not to ship too early. It is quite possible we might get one of the three planned Daybreak expansions before the end of the month. I’d bet on LOTRO being the first, but we’ll see. Took your first Blaugust very seriously, did you? LikeLike Actually that lines up with Blapril, which was the sixth run, when during early Covid we decided to do Blaugust early because we were all stuck at home and had plenty of time to write. It just so happens I have worked from home since then, which has meant more time for writing since I no longer have a commute. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Mind Affirm’s GAAP… It Only Misleads

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Many companies rely on misleading “adjusted” metrics to trick investors into thinking their business is stronger than it is in reality. The law allows companies to invent entirely new metrics or manipulate others to support a narrative that paints a more positive picture of the firm’s fundamentals. These companies often include disclaimers that caution against using non-GAAP metrics. Yet, the Street often builds its narratives on these “adjusted” metrics. “Adjusted” metrics are not the only problem. GAAP earnings are often misleading. Unusual, one-time gains or losses frequently distort reported GAAP results and cloud investors’ ability to understand the true economic performance of companies. To uncover real, Core Earnings, investors must dig into the details buried in the footnotes. This week’s Danger Zone pick is a perfect example of just how misleading reported earnings can be. The company recently reported positive GAAP earnings for the first time since its IPO. Meanwhile, Core Earnings remain highly negative. Further analysis reveals the company is burning through cash at an alarming pace. Only by leveraging superior fundamental data can investors get the truth about this company’s profitability, or lack thereof. I first put Affirm Holdings (AFRM) in the Danger Zone in October 2021, reiterated my bearish opinion most recently in October 2024, and named it a Zombie Stock in September 2022. GAAP profits may have investors re-thinking this company, so I believe now is a great time to remind investors how GAAP net income is misleading and show how AFRM remains overvalued. Affirm continues to grow its top-line at impressive levels. In fiscal 4Q25, revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 33% and 43% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. For the full year of fiscal 2025, Affirm grew revenue and GMV 39% and 38% YoY, respectively. The company also successfully onboarded new customers and merchants, with active consumers and active merchants rising 23% and 24% YoY respectively in fiscal 2025. Perhaps most noteworthy – at least to investors that don’t look beyond the surface numbers – Affirm generated positive GAAP net income in fiscal 2025, a first since fiscal 2019. While Affirm reports positive top-line growth and GAAP net income, a deeper analysis, one that accounts for the footnotes and MD&A of company filings, reveals a different picture. Beyond profitability, the company’s stock price remains overvalued, and after rising 83% last year and 25% YTD, it carries large downside risk. More on that later. Affirm has not reported positive operating profit in any fiscal year of my company model, which dates back to fiscal 2019. The company has not generated positive Core Earnings since fiscal 2019 either. This fact begs the question, how does Affirm report positive GAAP net income if reported operating profit and calculated Core Earnings are negative? The answer is non-operating income or income unrelated to its core business. In fiscal 2025, Affirm reported an operating loss of -$87 million. However, the company reported $149 million in “Other Income, net” on its income statement. This other income is interest earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest earned on securities available for sale, among other items. In other words, Affirm has a lot of cash and securities from all the stock it has sold, and that’s where it gets the income to generate positive GAAP net income, not from its core operation. I leverage my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI Agent to calculate Core Earnings, a proven superior earnings measure that excludes these unusual gains/losses. In doing so, I find that Affirm’s Core Earnings remain negative at -$78 million in Fiscal 2025. Figure 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings. Figure 1: Affirm’s GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings Reconciliation: Fiscal 2025 In Affirm’s quest to take market share, it has adopted a growth-at-all-costs approach, even going so far as stating “growth is always the answer” in the company’s fiscal 4Q24 shareholder letter. Total operating expenses, which include loss on loan purchase commitment, provision for credit losses, funding costs, processing and servicing, technology and data analytics, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and restructuring and other were 103% of revenue in fiscal 2025, which further explains why, as noted above, reported operating income is negative. When I first named Affirm a Zombie Stock in September 2022 it had enough cash on hand to sustain its cash burn for another 10 months. Affirm slowed its FCF burn from -$814 million in fiscal 2024 to -$425 million in fiscal 2025. The lower, yet still negative, FCF means Affirm no longer qualifies as a Zombie Stock because it has enough cash on hand to sustain its fiscal 2025 FCF burn for 61 months from the end of September 2025. Despite positive GAAP net income, Affirm continues to burn through cash each year. Affirm’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis in every year since fiscal 2019. On a quarterly basis, FCF has been negative in 14 of the 15 quarters over the same time. In fiscal 2025, the company burned -$425 million in FCF excluding acquisitions. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, Affirm burned through a cumulative $5.1 billion (18% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Affirm’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: Fiscal 2020 – Fiscal 2025 Per Figure 3, Affirm’s shares outstanding increased from 47 million in fiscal 2019 to 323 million in fiscal 2025. Whether through new share issuances or stock-based compensation, funding the business with new investors capital is not sustainable and not that different from a ponzi scheme. Figure 3: Affirm’s Shares Outstanding: Fiscal 2019 Through Fiscal 2025 In my recent report on Klarna (KLAR), one of Affirm’s key competitors, I pointed out how a growth-at-all-costs strategy can be successful in attracting users and growing GMV. In fact, Klarna used this approach to grow both users and GMV than traditional buy-now pay later peers Affirm and Afterpay (owned by Block, ticker XYZ). However, compared to PayPal (PYPL), the pure-play BNPL companies are miniscule. PayPal generated $1.7 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) in the TTM, with upwards of 434 million users/accounts. The scale and ubiquity of PayPal create strong competitive advantages, which ultimately manifest in higher margins and profitable operations. Figure 4: Comparing Users and GMV: BNPL Competitors: TTM * User data from end of 2023, when Afterpay last disclosed users**Annualized based on latest disclosed GMV of $8.24 billion in 3Q24 Payment plans or installment loans may look more attractive in an economic slowdown and as affordability of everyday items decreases. But such a slowdown doesn’t make one BNPL firm more attractive than another. Ultimately, each company is offering a largely undifferentiated product. Of buy now pay later (BNPL) users, PayPal (PYPL) is the clear top choice, with 56% of BNPL users having used PayPal, compared to 38% for Affirm. Additionally, merchants and retailers benefit from BNPL providers like Affirm and Klarna, which assume the credit risk of payment in return for a small fee paid by the merchant. Sure, Affirm gains users and GMV, but this structure leaves BNPL firms exposed to all the risk of payment. A recent study from LendingTree found that 41% of BNPL users say they paid late in the past year, which is up from 34% a year ago. Given these dynamics, it shouldn’t be surprising that the two pure-play BNPL companies are only competitors that don’t generate an ROIC and NOPAT margin above 0%. See Figure 5. Each of the other competitors, including PayPal (PYPL), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), American Express (AXP), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and others have more profitable business lines that can offset offering 0% interest loans and payment plans. Figure 5: Affirm Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Affirm’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Affirm fails to achieve the overly optimistic expectations in the current stock price. To justify its current price of $76/share, my model shows that Affirm would have to: In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $42.8 billion in fiscal 2035, or 13.3 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 110% of Visa’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $6.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or 1.3x PayPal’s TTM NOPAT and 2.8x Block’s TTM NOPAT. If I assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9% (equal to fiscal 2025), then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals $487 billion compared to fiscal 2025 GMV of $37 billion. For context, Amazon’s (AMZN) 2024 (calendar year) U.S. GMV is estimated at $792 billion. In other words, Affirm would need to generate nearly two-thirds the GMV of Amazon to justify its current stock price. Also keep in mind, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Affirm’s valuation even more unrealistic. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth just $45/share today – a 41% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $23.0 billion in fiscal 2035, or 7.1 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 97% of Block’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $3.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or nearly equal to Synchrony’s TTM NOPAT. If I again assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9%, then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals just under $262 billion, up from $37 billion in fiscal 2025. Lastly, if I assume: the stock would be worth just $28/share today – a 63% downside to the current price. This scenario still implies that Affirm generates $2.3 billion in NOPAT in fiscal 2035. Figure 6 compares Affirm’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include PayPal and Block’s TTM NOPAT. Figure 6: Affirm’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assume Affirm grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Affirm’s invested capital has grown 32% compounded annually since fiscal 2019. If I assume Affirm’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Affirm is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $32 million in total debt, has $728 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, $695 in minority interests, and has no excess cash. Affirm has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$2/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

This other income is interest earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest earned on securities available for sale, among other items. In other words, Affirm has a lot of cash and securities from all the stock it has sold, and that’s where it gets the income to generate positive GAAP net income, not from its core operation. I leverage my firm’s Robo-Analyst AI Agent to calculate Core Earnings, a proven superior earnings measure that excludes these unusual gains/losses. In doing so, I find that Affirm’s Core Earnings remain negative at -$78 million in Fiscal 2025. Figure 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings. Figure 1: Affirm’s GAAP Net Income to Core Earnings Reconciliation: Fiscal 2025 In Affirm’s quest to take market share, it has adopted a growth-at-all-costs approach, even going so far as stating “growth is always the answer” in the company’s fiscal 4Q24 shareholder letter. Total operating expenses, which include loss on loan purchase commitment, provision for credit losses, funding costs, processing and servicing, technology and data analytics, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and restructuring and other were 103% of revenue in fiscal 2025, which further explains why, as noted above, reported operating income is negative. When I first named Affirm a Zombie Stock in September 2022 it had enough cash on hand to sustain its cash burn for another 10 months. Affirm slowed its FCF burn from -$814 million in fiscal 2024 to -$425 million in fiscal 2025. The lower, yet still negative, FCF means Affirm no longer qualifies as a Zombie Stock because it has enough cash on hand to sustain its fiscal 2025 FCF burn for 61 months from the end of September 2025. Despite positive GAAP net income, Affirm continues to burn through cash each year. Affirm’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis in every year since fiscal 2019. On a quarterly basis, FCF has been negative in 14 of the 15 quarters over the same time. In fiscal 2025, the company burned -$425 million in FCF excluding acquisitions. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, Affirm burned through a cumulative $5.1 billion (18% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Affirm’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: Fiscal 2020 – Fiscal 2025 Per Figure 3, Affirm’s shares outstanding increased from 47 million in fiscal 2019 to 323 million in fiscal 2025. Whether through new share issuances or stock-based compensation, funding the business with new investors capital is not sustainable and not that different from a ponzi scheme. Figure 3: Affirm’s Shares Outstanding: Fiscal 2019 Through Fiscal 2025 In my recent report on Klarna (KLAR), one of Affirm’s key competitors, I pointed out how a growth-at-all-costs strategy can be successful in attracting users and growing GMV. In fact, Klarna used this approach to grow both users and GMV than traditional buy-now pay later peers Affirm and Afterpay (owned by Block, ticker XYZ). However, compared to PayPal (PYPL), the pure-play BNPL companies are miniscule. PayPal generated $1.7 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) in the TTM, with upwards of 434 million users/accounts. The scale and ubiquity of PayPal create strong competitive advantages, which ultimately manifest in higher margins and profitable operations. Figure 4: Comparing Users and GMV: BNPL Competitors: TTM * User data from end of 2023, when Afterpay last disclosed users**Annualized based on latest disclosed GMV of $8.24 billion in 3Q24 Payment plans or installment loans may look more attractive in an economic slowdown and as affordability of everyday items decreases. But such a slowdown doesn’t make one BNPL firm more attractive than another. Ultimately, each company is offering a largely undifferentiated product. Of buy now pay later (BNPL) users, PayPal (PYPL) is the clear top choice, with 56% of BNPL users having used PayPal, compared to 38% for Affirm. Additionally, merchants and retailers benefit from BNPL providers like Affirm and Klarna, which assume the credit risk of payment in return for a small fee paid by the merchant. Sure, Affirm gains users and GMV, but this structure leaves BNPL firms exposed to all the risk of payment. A recent study from LendingTree found that 41% of BNPL users say they paid late in the past year, which is up from 34% a year ago. Given these dynamics, it shouldn’t be surprising that the two pure-play BNPL companies are only competitors that don’t generate an ROIC and NOPAT margin above 0%. See Figure 5. Each of the other competitors, including PayPal (PYPL), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), American Express (AXP), Synchrony Financial (SYF), and others have more profitable business lines that can offset offering 0% interest loans and payment plans. Figure 5: Affirm Profitability Vs. Competitors: TTM Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Affirm’s stock price. I also present an additional DCF scenario to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Affirm fails to achieve the overly optimistic expectations in the current stock price. To justify its current price of $76/share, my model shows that Affirm would have to: In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $42.8 billion in fiscal 2035, or 13.3 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 110% of Visa’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $6.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or 1.3x PayPal’s TTM NOPAT and 2.8x Block’s TTM NOPAT. If I assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9% (equal to fiscal 2025), then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals $487 billion compared to fiscal 2025 GMV of $37 billion. For context, Amazon’s (AMZN) 2024 (calendar year) U.S. GMV is estimated at $792 billion. In other words, Affirm would need to generate nearly two-thirds the GMV of Amazon to justify its current stock price. Also keep in mind, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are also “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Affirm’s valuation even more unrealistic. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth just $45/share today – a 41% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Affirm’s revenue would reach $23.0 billion in fiscal 2035, or 7.1 times higher than the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue and 97% of Block’s TTM revenue. In this scenario, Affirm’s NOPAT would reach $3.6 billion in fiscal 2035, or nearly equal to Synchrony’s TTM NOPAT. If I again assume Affirm maintains a revenue to GMV rate of just under 9%, then this scenario implies Affirm’s GMV in fiscal 2035 equals just under $262 billion, up from $37 billion in fiscal 2025. Lastly, if I assume: the stock would be worth just $28/share today – a 63% downside to the current price. This scenario still implies that Affirm generates $2.3 billion in NOPAT in fiscal 2035. Figure 6 compares Affirm’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For reference, I include PayPal and Block’s TTM NOPAT. Figure 6: Affirm’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assume Affirm grows revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate the high level of expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Affirm’s invested capital has grown 32% compounded annually since fiscal 2019. If I assume Affirm’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Affirm is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company owes $32 million in total debt, has $728 million in outstanding employee stock option liabilities, $695 in minority interests, and has no excess cash. Affirm has an economic book value, or no growth value, of -$2/share. In other words I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: Mind Affirm’s GAAP… It Only Misleads

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Many companies rely on misleading “adjusted” metrics to trick investors into thinking their business is stronger than it is in reality. The law allows companies to invent entirely new metrics or manipulate others to support a narrative that paints a more positive picture of the firm’s fundamentals. These companies often include disclaimers that caution against using non-GAAP metrics. Yet, the Street often builds its narratives on these “adjusted” metrics. “Adjusted” metrics are not the only problem. GAAP earnings are often misleading. Unusual, one-time gains or losses frequently distort reported GAAP results and cloud investors’ ability to understand the true economic performance of companies. To uncover real, Core Earnings, investors must dig into the details buried in the footnotes. This week’s Danger Zone pick is a perfect example of just how misleading reported earnings can be. The company recently reported positive GAAP earnings for the first time since its IPO. Meanwhile, Core Earnings remain highly negative. Further analysis reveals the company is burning through cash at an alarming pace. Only by leveraging superior fundamental data can investors get the truth about this company’s profitability, or lack thereof. I first put Affirm Holdings (AFRM) in the Danger Zone in October 2021, reiterated my bearish opinion most recently in October 2024, and named it a Zombie Stock in September 2022. GAAP profits may have investors re-thinking this company, so I believe now is a great time to remind investors how GAAP net income is misleading and show how AFRM remains overvalued. Affirm continues to grow its top-line at impressive levels. In fiscal 4Q25, revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 33% and 43% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. For the full year of fiscal 2025, Affirm grew revenue and GMV 39% and 38% YoY, respectively. The company also successfully onboarded new customers and merchants, with active consumers and active merchants rising 23% and 24% YoY respectively in fiscal 2025. Perhaps most noteworthy – at least to investors that don’t look beyond the surface numbers – Affirm generated positive GAAP net income in fiscal 2025, a first since fiscal 2019. While Affirm reports positive top-line growth and GAAP net income, a deeper analysis, one that accounts for the footnotes and MD&A of company filings, reveals a different picture. Beyond profitability, the company’s stock price remains overvalued, and after rising 83% last year and 25% YTD, it carries large downside risk. More on that later. Affirm has not reported positive operating profit in any fiscal year of my company model, which dates back to fiscal 2019. The company has not generated positive Core Earnings since fiscal 2019 either. This fact begs the question, how does Affirm report positive GAAP net income if reported operating profit and calculated Core Earnings are negative? The answer is non-operating income or income unrelated to its core business. In fiscal 2025, Affirm reported an operating loss of -$87 million. However, the company reported $149 million in “Other Income, net” on its income statement. This other income is interest earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest earned on securities available for sale, among other items. In other words, Affirm has a lot of cash and securities from all the stock it has sold, and that’s where it gets the income to generate positive GAAP net income, not from its core operation.

The mighty heft of Amazon is hoisting the U.S. stock market higher on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, erasing much of its slump from the day before and nearing its all-time high set on Tuesday. The index is on track to close a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, which would be its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher. Amazon led the way after jumping 11.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming huge cloud-computing business has reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Apple also helped lift the market after its stock added 0.3%. It likewise delivered a better profit report than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. The two Big Tech profit reports were the among most important on Wall Street Friday because Amazon, worth roughly $2.4 trillion, and Apple, at over $4 trillion, are two of the biggest companies in the market. They alone account for 10.6% of the S&P 500’s total value, even though they make up just 0.4% of its membership. That means their stock movements can carry more weight on the S&P 500 index, which sits at the heart of many 401(k) accounts, than hundreds of other stocks. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 14.7% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 3.2% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 1.9% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to every investor with one. They helped offset a 3.7% drop for AbbVie, even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies to deliver strong growth in profits to help justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the stock market has become too expensive. Friday’s overall gains helped Wall Street recover from Thursday’s slump, when the S&P 500 fell 1%. Investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as the investment spree related to artificial-intelligence technology keeps gushing. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia Friday. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month and at the fastest pace in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record index after a report showed industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in September, beating market expectations. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased a bit after their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned markets that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.08% from 4.11% late Thursday, but it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. ___ AP Business Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Amazon shares soar 11% on strong cloud growth, easing investor fears over AI spending

Shares in Amazon soared about 11% to reach a new record high Friday after the firm reported its strongest cloud growth since 2022 – easing investor fears that industry giants have been overspending on AI. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had soared 1.2% Friday morning as of about 10:50 a.m. ET, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Averaged jumped 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. On Thursday, investors sent shares in Meta and Microsoft sliding about 12% and 3%, respectively, after both companies announced plans to hike capital expenditures on AI. Major stock indexes are still set to the end the week higher. The Dow and Nasdaq are on track for their longest streaks of monthly gains since January 2018. Amazon on Thursday revealed it had notched its fastest cloud-computing growth since 2022 and announced plans to raise its data-center capacity. Revenue in its cloud unit jumped 20.2% in the most recent quarter – beating Wall Street estimates of 18.1%. The company is currently the leading provider of cloud infrastructure tech. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months,” CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday. It reported earnings per share of $1.95, above estimates of $1.57, and revenue of $180.17 billion, beating expectations of $177.8 billion. For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects to bring in sales of $206 billion to $213 billion, above what analysts were expecting. It also expects operating income of between $21 billion and $26 billion, compared to estimates of $23.8 billion. Like other tech giants this week, Amazon hiked its planned capital expenditures for this year. It now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025 – up from $118 billion. The company plans to spend even more next year. Just this week, the firm launched Project Rainier, an $11 billion data center in rural Indiana. But Amazon has been focused on cutting costs in other areas, launching a round of 14,000 job cuts this week. In total, the Seattle-based company is reportedly planning to slash 30,000 corporate jobs – or about 9% of its global office workforce – over the coming weeks. During an earnings call Thursday, Jassy said the layoffs were not “financially driven,” but rather a “culture” move as the firm aims to cut down on bureaucracy. Apple on Thursday also reported upbeat quarterly earnings and a strong forecast for December. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

While the shares initially jumped Friday morning, they later fell about 0.3% since its sales and revenue in China — one of the company’s largest markets — missed expectations. However, it reported earnings per share of $1.85, above estimates of $1.77, and revenue of $102.47 billion, beating expectations of $102.24 billion. The company expects revenue to soar 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter – well above Wall Street estimates of 6%, said Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh. A “double-digit” increase in iPhone sales from the previous year is expected to lead the revenue beat, he added. That’s thanks to an “off the chart” global response to Apple’s new iPhone 17 lineup, CEO Tim Cook said, adding that store traffic is up significantly on a yearly basis. In the most recent quarter, Apple reported $27.46 billion in net income, up from $14.29 billion in the same period last year. A one-time tax charge pushed last year’s figure lower. For fiscal year 2025, Apple reported $416 billion in total revenue – up 6% from the previous year. Sales in the most recent quarter jumped 8% from the same time last year. Total iPhone revenue jumped 6% to $49.03 billion. The new iPhone 17 models went on sale on Sept. 19, so only about a week of these sales were included in the quarterly earnings report. Analysts had expected $50.19 billion in iPhone sales. Cook said the miss was because several models were affected by supply constraints. The company’s iPad business came in flat, with $6.95 billion in sales. Services – which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions, App Store charges and warranties for hardware – rose 15% to $24.97 billion in sales. Its “Other Products” category, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Vision Pro, dipped slightly to $9.04 billion in sales. Its Mac business also jumped 13% to $8.72 billion in sales. Cook said the company had not hiked prices due to tariffs. Instead, Apple is “just absorbing the tariffs in gross margin.” A gross margin of 47.2% beat estimates of 46.4%. Advertisement

Title: AI will accelerate the end of brick and mortar’s reign: Amazon CEO

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The domination of e-commerce is inevitable and will only come faster thanks to the emerging technology, even if physical stores represent opportunity for now, Andy Jassy told analysts Thursday. Amazon sees “a significant opportunity” for growth in its existing physical stores, which are centered on grocery — at least for now. The e-commerce giant announced plans to expand same-day deliveries of fresh groceries, now in 1,000 U.S. cities, to 2,300 by the end of the year. Even that could be seen as an extension of e-commerce as much of physical retail. In any case, despite the current dominance of brick and mortar, e-commerce will ultimately take over, and AI is making that happen even faster than before, Andy Jassy told analysts on a Thursday earnings call. “I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores,” he said. “That equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that.” Physical retail remains a small, if growing, portion of Amazon’s retail operation. In Q3 online store sales rose 10% year over year to $67.4 billion, while physical stores sales rose 7% to $5.6 billion, according to financial filings Thursday. Overall product sales rose 9.6% to $74.1 billion. There’s a price to all of that e-commerce, as worldwide shipping costs rose 8% to $25.4 billion. Several analysts noted that Amazon is taking share in retail. But other aspects of the retail business are growing faster than either the online or offline channel. Seller services sales grew 12% to $42.5 billion; advertising grew 24% to $17.7 billion; and subscription services grew 11% to $12.6 billion. Whatever the impact of AI on the retail landscape, there’s no doubt it’s fueling Amazon’s tech operation, and Amazon’s tech operation is fueling profits. Most analyst reports released Thursday and Friday focused on the company’s AWS unit, where Q3 net sales rose 20% year on year to over $33 billion. Even with estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs, AWS segment operating income rose over 9% to $11.4 billion. Overall operating income, including two special charges — $2.5 billion from a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs related to planned layoffs — was essentially flat from last year at $17.4 billion. “Clearly AWS continues to drive the bus here, with acceleration in growth and better-than-expected operating margin in the segment,” William Blair analysts led by Dylan Carden said in a Friday client note. The 14,000 layoffs confirmed by Amazon earlier in the week are also tied to AI, as the company said it anticipates a need for fewer people as generative AI continues to advance.

Title: WealthStack Roundup: Orion to Rollout Denali AI in 2026

AI announcements from Orion, SS&C and Boosted.ai and alts tech news from Envestnet and SignatureFD with CAIS. October 31, 2025 Wealthtech provider Orion announced Denali AI this week, the company’s new enterprise intelligence platform that will power what the company is referring to as its AI-first ecosystem, when it is fully available. For now, the technology remains in beta with select Orion advisory firm clients. Broad availability is expected sometime in 2026 at which time details on pricing and other aspects of Denali will be provided, according to the firm. The AI has been built to connect every system and workflow across the Orion technology ecosystem. On the Orion website, the company calls the technology “Your Firm’s AI Command Center,” stating it was designed to provide a firm’s administrators with full control and visibility into their AI environment, including usage data, activity logs and other connected sources and will be where firms define their AI-related configurations, set and align policies, and ensure that the AI matches a firm’s compliance and governance standards. “Orion Denali AI is the cornerstone of Orion’s future … by combining automation that expands capacity, insights that anticipate client needs, and intelligence that supports better decisions,” said Reed Colley, president of Orion Advisor Technology, in a statement. Orion demonstrated artificial intelligence assistants and other AI-driven features at the Future Proof conference in September. Related:Financial Monitoring Application Carefull Announces AI This week, Envestnet announced the launch of two managed model portfolios that include interval funds on its platform. The new funds are available through Envestnet’s Strategist UMA. The new models integrate semi-liquid and liquid strategies, enabling seamless allocation to alternatives with point-and-click simplicity, according to Dana D'Auria, co-CIO and Group President of Envestnet Solutions, in a statement. The first two models are from Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, with others slated for 2026 from Fidelity Investments and State Street. The Franklin Templeton fund has five risk-based options ranging from Conservative to Aggressive. The portfolio will incorporate a 10% allocation to alternatives. The BlackRock fund is a multi-asset income fund with private market models and incorporates public and private credit, covered call strategies and dividend-focused equities. Neither fund will require subscription documents, and both provide simplified tax reporting. Last week, Envestnet announced the appointment of Bhaskar Peddhapati as chief technology officer. He will be responsible for all aspects of technology, engineering and information security across the company. He most recently ran the mortgage technology team at Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). Related:WealthStack Roundup: bQuest Joins The Founders Arena SS&C this week announced the launch of its AI agent catalogue. The available agents, which were developed, tested and used within SS&C prior to their external availability, range in their use cases from trade reconciliation and validation to contract analysis. The agents are delivered as a managed service, designed to help organizations overcome talent shortages and operational bottlenecks. Annuity carrier American Life, an SS&C customer, for example, is currently evaluating SS&C’s Credit Agreement Document Agent for possible use in streamlining the processing of its private credit operations by having the AI agent review and update lengthy loan documents. The agents in its catalogue have been built using SS&C’s AI Gateway, which provides secure, auditable access to large language models and employs real-time guardrails for advanced security and data loss protection, real-time risk monitoring, and explainability of actions. And SS&C offers a range of deployment options, including hosting the AI Agents and AI Gateway on its own privately owned GPU infrastructure in ISO-compliant data centers, ensuring full custody of client data. Boosted.ai has launched voice-powered AI research agents, making it the first investment research platform that enables analysts and advisors to converse with a research agent in real-time. Boosted.ai has integrated the natural language voice technology from ElevenLabs, meaning that those employing Boosted.ai’s Alfa agent can speak to it naturally, in real time, when making queries. In a prepared statement, Boosted.ai provided the following hypothetical to illustrate how a verbal conversation might proceed: Portfolio Manager: “Hey Alfa, look at companies in the S&P 500 with a dividend yield over 2% and a price-to-earnings ratio greater than 15. Then read earnings transcripts, SEC filings, and news for those stocks over the last 3 months and summarize their exposure to China.” Boosted.ai Alfa response: “I’ve identified 27 names, concentrated in industrials, consumer staples, and energy. A significant number have meaningful exposure to China, both as a revenue source and a supply chain dependency. Would you like me to group them by sector or by level of exposure?” While not a household name for most financial advisors, Boosted.ai launched in 2017 and is perhaps better known to asset and investment managers; it raised $15 million in funding last November. SignatureFD Partners with CAIS, DFA, Axcelus on Tax-Advantaged PPLI Vehicle SignatureFD, an RIA with $10 billion in assets, launched AutographFD, an operating division that will allow investors to allocate money to both public and private investment strategies within the tax-advantaged private placement life insurance wrapper. The RIA is partnering with alternative investment platform CAIS on private strategies, Dimensional Fund Advisors on public strategies and Innovator on defined outcome strategies. Autograph has incorporated AI into its platform to educate investors on alternative strategies and streamline the process of getting PPLI for clients. Axcelus Financial, with which SignatureFD has a long-term relationship, will be providing the insurance. According to Doug Liptak, chief strategy officer at SigntureFD and founder of AutographFD, PPLI has traditionally been available on the very high end of the private investor market, to family offices with over $100 million in assets. AutographFD makes PPLI available to qualified purchasers with $3-million-plus in investable assets, although the average users will likely be investors with $10 million in assets. Liptak noted that both end-investors and outside financial advisors have responded to news of AutographFD development with enthusiasm since it allows for tax-free growth of PPLI investments and simplified administration, with no K-1 forms, capital calls or subscription documents that need to be signed. “It’s a better way to access alternatives from a tax-free standpoint,” he said. “Autograph allows you to do it all inside an institutionally priced policy and then get the tax benefits.” Davis Janowski Senior Technology Editor, WealthManagement.com Davis Janowski is a New York-based technology journalist whose work spans consumer, business and the FinTech sectors.

Title: Slog AM: Seattle's Soggy Halloween, Prince Andrew Is a Prince No More, Trump Demands That GOP Kill Filibuster

Happy Halloween, you little ghouls: I have compiled an especially spooky, scary morning news for you. Except, not really. These are just the regular headlines. Because every day is hell. The Scariest Thing This Halloween: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained the recent 14,000-person tech layoffs (2,303 of which hit Seattle Amazonians). He said the reason wasn't financial nor was it about AI. Instead, it was culture. He said the company grew fast, hired faster, and now had too many "layers." This is not the way to operate, apparently. With so many people the company can't "be flat and... move fast." The culture Jassy speaks of is this: Amazon is not in the business of people, but of course, in the business of profit. Too many people bogs down the profit. This year, Amazon reported $180.2 billion and Amazon Web Services reported $33 billion in sales. It is never enough. After the layoffs, Amazon's stock ticked up 14%. Watch Out, This Could Be You: Man Wouldn't Have Worn Costume To Work If He'd Known He Was Getting Laid Off [image or embed] Another Halloween Fright: Traffic will be bad for those of you stuck in your little cars. Take a bus or a train to your Halloween party. The I-5 Ship Canal Bridge construction will continue this weekend in the southbound lanes. Rain won't stop that mess. Rain could stop the planned construction on I-405. If it doesn't, then prepare for multiple northbound lane closures between Northeast 124th Street and Northeast 160th Street. Annnnnd all westbound lanes on I-90 from Mercer Island to Seattle are closing Friday night through early Saturday morning. The real horror: Halloween is the day the most child pedestrian deaths happen in the US. Don't drive your stupid car tonight in the stupid rain and hit any stupid kids. I'm warning you! Happy Halloween!!! Reminder that Halloween is the most dangerous day of the year for pedestrians, so: 1. Don’t drive2. If you must drive, slow down!3. Longer term, advocate for more walkability where you live[image or embed] Something Wicked This Way Comes: Trick or Treaters beware. An atmospheric river-like weather system will unleash a soggy hell on this evening's festivities and the weekend that follows. It'll be gushers only in your candy pail. Cause of the rain. Darkness Falls: The clocks roll back starting Sunday morning at 2 a.m. Winter is readying its cold, spindly fingers around our necks. After this weekend, sunset will fall at a dastardly 4:49 p.m. In Skeleton News: Flava Flav has been anointed the official hype man for the US bobsled and skeleton teams in the 2026 Winter Olympics. In case you, like me, forgot there are Olympics next year, there are and they will be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Stripping Prince Andrew: No! No! Not like that. Well, a little like that? Britain's King Charles has started the process of severing his brother's ties with the monarchy. The now-almost-ex prince has been mired in controversy over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal of being friends with a serial sex pest creep reached new heights recently after Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir alleged Andrew assaulted her when she was a teen. Andrew denied these allegations. Not enough! No princely titles and no more lodging at royal estates for you, buddy. Trump Calls for the End of the Filibuster: President Donald Trump would like the shutdown to end. Not through compromise, of course. On Truth Social, Trump screamed, "INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER." Overcoming a filibuster in the full Senate requires 60 votes. The Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate. To abolish the filibuster as a whole would change how the Senate does debate. Democrats continue to block the measure that would fund the government because they're fighting for the reinstatement of healthcare subsidies so Americans don't suffer even more exorbitant insurance costs. Trump called getting rid of the filibuster the Senate GOP's "TRUMP CARD." The GOP fears eliminating the filibuster could hurt them if the Democrats ever regain control of Congress. Whatever happens, it'll be too late to save SNAP benefits before they run dry on Nov. 1. The government shutdown has lasted 31 days. It will at least last a few more. Senators left D.C. without making any deals. Millions of people will have to deal with their SNAP benefits lapsing tomorrow. However, there is a shred of hope. A federal judge from Massachusetts will decide Friday whether the Trump administration must continue to fund food stamps during the shutdown. Justice? Some Senators couldn't get home last night after their long day of not re-opening the government. Why? Shutdown-induced delays at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Melissa Kills 49: Hurricane Melissa killed 30 people in Haiti, and 20 people are still missing. In Jamaica, Melissa's death toll reached 19. The now-Category 2 storm steered mostly clear of Bermuda, which experienced her wrath as a strong tropical storm. Illinois Advocates Sue Feds: Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center have sued Immigrations and Custom Enforcement for its treatment of detainees. According to the suit, ICE officials have blocked detainees from contacting lawyers, deprived them of food and medical treatment, and forced them to sign papers relinquishing their rights.

You have until Tuesday night at 8 p.m. to return your ballot to a King County ballot dropbox. If you're mailing your ballot, do it today. We Have the Louvre Heist at Home: Thieves nabbed more than 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California's off-site storage facility. They stole metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets, scrimshaw walrus tusks, and 20th century sports memorabilia. We are in a heist heyday! A Long Read: Rich liberal family hires part-time live-in nanny for their child at their upstate New York home. The nanny gets kind of weird, then refuses to leave. I hate when this happens! A Kentucky woman opened a package expecting the medicine she had ordered. Instead, she found "arms and fingers." The county coroner said there had been a mishap with "an airline company, a freight company, and a courier." The coroner picked up the arms and fingers from the woman and intended to return them to the courier so the arms and fingers can go to their intended recipient. It is unclear who ordered the arms and fingers and for what purpose. Likely, not for medicine. Viva la France: A 77-year-old French cyclist fell 130 feet into a ravine and survived for three days thanks to the bottles of red wine he was toting in his grocery bags. A Song for Your Halloween: It is really the only song to listen to today. Nathalie Graham has reported on everything from Seattle City Hall to underwater hockey for The Stranger. She likes covering anything she finds fun, weird, or interesting. You can find a lot of that in her column, Play Date. She hates dentists and loves costume parties.

Title: Amazon hoists Wall Street toward another winning week and month

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon led the U.S. stock market on Friday to the finish of another winning week and month. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and pulled closer to its all-time high set on Tuesday. It closed out a third straight winning week and a sixth straight winning month, its longest monthly winning streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. Amazon led the way and jumped 9.6%. The retail giant was by far the strongest force lifting the market after reporting profit for the latest quarter that blew past analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth for its booming cloud-computing business has accelerated to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022. Amazon’s massive size of roughly $2.4 trillion means its stock movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than almost any other company’s. Without it, the S&P 500 would have been down for the day. Another highly influential stock, Apple, had less of an effect on the market even though it’s bigger than Amazon. The iPhone maker, which is worth more than $4 trillion, swung between modest gains and losses through the day before finishing with a dip of 0.4%. It likewise delivered a better profit report for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though by not as big a margin as Amazon did. CEO Tim Cook said it benefited from strong revenue for both its iPhone lineup and its services offerings, which include its app store. Elsewhere on Wall Street, online message board Reddit jumped 7.5% to erase losses from earlier in the week after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Coinbase Global rose 4.6% after the crypto exchange’s profit likewise topped expectations. Outside of earnings reports, Netflix added 2.7% after the video streamer announced a move that could make its stock price more affordable but still leave all its investors holding the same amount. Netflix will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, where it will give nine additional shares to investors for each they own. They helped offset a drop for AbbVie, which fell 4.5% even though the medicine maker reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to how it’s beating forecasts by less than before, and expectations may have been high after AbbVie’s stock came into the day with a strong 28.4% gain for the year so far. The pressure is on companies broadly to deliver big growth in profits to justify the huge gains their stock prices have made since April. Criticism has been growing that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive. A day earlier, the S&P 500 slumped 1% as investors appeared unnerved by big increases in spending that Meta Platforms and Microsoft are planning as part of the investment spree underway in artificial-intelligence technology. Financial markets also appeared skeptical that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would put an end to tensions between the two countries. Additional drops on Friday of 1.5% for Microsoft and 2.7% for Meta were the two heaviest weights on the U.S. market. All told, the S&P 500 rose 17.86 points to 6,840.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40.75 to 47,562.87, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 143.81 to 23,724.96. In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. Stocks fell 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after data showed factory activity in China contracted in October for a seventh straight month. Japan’s Nikkei 225, meanwhile, jumped 2.1% to another record after a report showed industrial production rose more in September than expected. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased following their spurt higher in the middle of the week, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that another cut to interest rates in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 4.09% from 4.11% late Thursday, though it’s still above the 3.99% level it was at before Powell’s warning. Other central banks have halted cuts to rates or hinted at pauses recently, and “it seems this is it for the 2025 easing season in developed economies,” economists at Bank of America wrote in a BofA Global Research report. AP Business Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.

Title: Netflix Stock Is Set for a 10-for-1 Split. What You Need To Know

Netflix said it plans to undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, in a move that could make its stock more accessible to a wider range of investors. The split, which is set to take place after the closing bell on Friday, Nov. 14, means shareholders will receive nine new Netflix (NFLX) shares for every one they owned heading into the split. Their overall stake in the company won’t change because of it, but each share will subsequently be worth about 10% of its price before the split took effect. Trading at the split-adjusted price is scheduled to begin when the market opens on Monday, Nov. 17. Netflix said the change is meant to “reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.” That could also make it more attractive to investors outside the company who may have shied away from the stock at its recent levels after a run-up this year. Shares of Netflix were up over 3% around $1,123 in recent trading, bringing their year-to-date gains to about 26%, outpacing the broader S&P 500's roughly 16% over the same period. Netflix’s 10-for-1 stock split follows similar moves by large-cap tech companies looking to make their shares more affordable to employees and retail investors. Stock splits can help boost liquidity and make trading easier for buyers and sellers. Though Netflix shares took a hit earlier this month after the company's third-quarter earnings missed analysts' estimates due to a one-time tax expense in Brazil, it's been a strong year for the streaming giant's stock, which has benefited from a well-received slate of content and expectations of continued growth, along with the perception that it's relatively insulated from shifting tariff policies. The decision to undergo a split, typically considered a positive signal by investors, could also point to confidence in further gains ahead for Netflix. By contrast, reverse stock splits—which consolidate shares to raise the price of each individual share—are often taken as a sign of concern about a marked decline in the price of a stock.

Title: The Weekly Closeout: Lululemon links up with the NFL, Parade shuts down

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The activewear brand is launching an apparel collection surrounding the league’s teams, while the intimates brand abruptly ceased operations after six years. It’s been another week with far more retail news than there is time in the day. Below, we break down some things you may have missed during the week and what we’re still thinking about. From retail’s onslaught of layoffs to how much Walmart captured from SNAP grocery spending last year, here’s our closeout for the week. Lululemon throws a Hail Mary As it navigates a rare tough patch, Lululemon is hoping a partnership with the NFL can inject some momentum into the business. The athleisure giant on Monday announced it would release an “elevated apparel collection” surrounding the NFL’s 32 teams. The product line, released Tuesday, pulls from Lululemon’s Steady State, Define, Scuba and Align styles and crosses both men’s and women’s. The assortment features both apparel and accessories. Products will be available at the NFL Shop website, Fanatics and team retail locations, including stadium stores. Celeste Burgoyne, president of the Americas and global guest innovation at Lululemon, said the retailer was “thrilled” to be a part of the weekly NFL ritual. “True NFL fans wear their pride. For them, fan gear is more than apparel, it’s a badge of loyalty and a way to instantly connect with a community that is like a family,” Burgoyne said. Analysts aren’t as rosy on the partnership. Jefferies analysts this week called the decision “another questionable move that doesn't make sense” and said it hinted at “deeper strategic confusion.” The move mirrors others aimed at attracting young shoppers, Jefferies wrote, but that risks alienating its core female shopper. “It remains unclear how selling NFL apparel fits into [Lululemon’s] long-term vision,” Jefferies analysts said. “Is this a one-off licensing play, or a signal of a permanent shift toward mass-market, logo-driven product? There is little evidence that these moves will drive durable, profitable growth.” Gen Z-focused intimates brand Parade shuts down DTC intimates brand Parade has shut down after six years, the company announced in an email to customers over the weekend. “Parade was created with the intention to welcome you all to express yourself in full-spectrum color with confidence, and we hope we were able to create that space for you,” the email read. The brand was founded by Cami Téllez and launched in 2019. In 2023, Parade was acquired by Ariela & Associates International. Over the years, the brand expanded beyond its intimates roots, launching into swimwear and activewear. In its message this week, Parade directed customers to Ariela’s other brands, including Curvy Couture and Smart&Sexy. Bacon the holidays better It might be Halloween, but companies already have their sites set on other celebrations. Dunkin' will start selling its holiday season lineup on Wednesday. This year features a Cookie Butter Cloud Latte and a Berry Sangria Refresher, along with returning favorites Peppermint Mocha and Toasted White Chocolate Signature Lattes. Food offerings include a new Raspberry Striped Croissant and two bacon jam options — the Ultimate Bacon Jam Breakfast Sandwich and Bacon Jam Grilled Cheese. The company is also offering limited-edition packaging designs. “After seeing fans make their own Cookie Butter hacks, we knew it was time to make it official with the Cookie Butter Cloud Latte,” Anthony Epter, vice president of menu innovation at Dunkin’, said in a statement. “And because we know how busy the season can be, we created our Bacon Jam lineup to give guests something satisfying and easy to enjoy on the go.” 26% That’s the percentage Walmart captured in SNAP grocery spend over the past year, according to a Numerator report. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food benefits to low-income families to support their grocery budgets, will not be issued to tens of millions of Americans on Saturday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. SNAP shoppers spend an average of $2,653 annually at Walmart, per the report. A whirlwind of layoffs The past week or so has brought a downpour of layoffs. Amazon is reducing its corporate workforce by around 14,000 with some outlets reporting more layoffs to come, while Puma will eliminate around 900 corporate jobs (adding to the 500 roles it cut earlier this year). Children’s clothing store Carter’s will lay off 300, Target cut 1,800 jobs and UPS has eliminated about 34,000 positions so far this year.

Title: How some of the world's biggest tech companies stacked up during earnings season

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Happy Halloween! Keep an eye out for AI-inspired costumes tonight. (Just good luck trying to automate trick-or-treating!) In case you missed it, I had a fantastic discussion with Eugene Kim and Aki Ito yesterday about the Amazon layoffs and its wider impact across corporate America. Luckily, you can watch a replay of the whole discussion here. In today's big story, tech earnings have finally wrapped. Here's what you need to know. What's on deck: Markets: The former McKinsey executive who is Zohran Mamdani's bridge to NYC's C-suite. Tech: Who got rich from Navan's IPO? Business: The era of the never-ending layoff might be here. But first, give me the CliffNotes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. If you blinked, you might have missed it. Earnings season hit Big Tech, and there's a lot to unpack. (And a lot of AI spending going on.) Five of the world's most important companies provided updates on their businesses over the course of two days. To quickly catch you up on how things shook out, here's a rundown on the main takeaways from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. But first, a quick plug for my colleague Alistair Barr's newsletter. Tech Memo is a must-subscribe if you even have a slight interest in the industry, so do yourself a favor and click here. Ok, let's dive in. Alphabet: Hot on ChatGPT's heels. Look out, OpenAI. Here comes Gemini. Google's chatbot now has 650 million monthly active users. That's about a 44% jump from just a few months ago. Sure, it still trails the behemoth that is ChatGPT, which has a staggering 800 million weekly active users. But the growth shows Gemini is building momentum, and especially with the youths. Josh Woodward, the VP of Google Labs who leads the Gemini app, told BI's Hugh Langley there has been a big demographic shift to younger users. That's thanks to its viral image editor Nano Banana. Microsoft: Spend, spend, spend. Spending big on AI infrastructure was already a massive theme in tech heading into earnings, and Microsoft certainly didn't stray from the path. An internal memo from CFO Amy Hood seen by BI's Ashley Stewart highlighted the company's record $34.9 billion infrastructure spending to meet AI demand this quarter. Investors aren't necessarily buying it, as concerns are growing about whether all this money will lead to some ROI. Meta: Oh, you think that's a lot of tech spending? Hold my beer. Meta has never shied away from its intent to spend big on AI. That proved true this week when it bumped its estimate for infrastructure spend this year to between $70 billion and $72 billion. The number raised plenty of questions for Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps his answers didn't land quite the right way. Meta's stock tumbled more than 11% on Thursday. Meta's commitment to AI is clear, but loyalty to a trend is a fickle thing at the tech giant. Remember the good old metaverse? It got zero mentions from Meta executives on Wednesday's call. Apple: Big trouble in China. The iPhone maker delivered an earnings beat, with revenue growing 8% year over year. However, things weren't so bright in China, an important market for Apple. Revenue was actually down compared to a year ago, and it's not like 2024 was a banner year for Apple in the country either. Amazon: Layoffs? What layoffs? Only a few days removed from cutting 14,000 corporate employees, Amazon reported some big wins in earnings. There was huge growth, particularly when it came to its somewhat beleaguered cloud unit. As for those layoffs, CEO Andy Jassy offered some clarity about the motivation. According to Jassy, it wasn't about AI or even cost savings. It was because they didn't fit the culture, he said. 1. Meet Zohran Mamdani's CEO whisperer. Former McKinsey executive and Ayn Rand fan Yasser Salem has become the democratic socialist candidate's bridge to New York's C-suite. Salem hopes to turn skeptics into partners and told BI that he has met with over 70 CEOs to discuss their concerns. 2. Hedge funds are on track for a banner year. Despite an array of macroeconomic headwinds, the industry is set to have its best annual showing since the pandemic, according to fund administrator Citco. Multistrategy funds are leading the way, with an average return of 19.3%. 3. JPMorgan wants everyone in its 300,000 workforce to become AI pros. America's biggest bank is rolling out a firmwide AI training push, but it'll affect different workers in different ways, chief analytics officer Derek Waldron said in an interview with McKinsey. The multi-pronged strategy is helping people get comfortable, he said. 1. Navan finally makes its (public) debut. The travel and expense management company has become the largest to test the IPO waters during a government shutdown. BI calculated the numbers — and these are the big VC winners. 2. Use AI, but don't depend on it. Many bosses are encouraging workers to lean in on AI, but some are also worried workers could forget how to do their jobs without it. 3. AI is starting to take a bite out of Wikipedia's traffic. Wiki reported its traffic is down 8% in the last few months when compared to the same time last year, and AI summaries and chatbots that aggregate its data are largely to blame. BI's Katie Notopoulos explores whether Wikipedia is in trouble or not. 1. The world's most important economic relationship just got a reset. Donald Trump and Xi Jinping emerged from their first IRL meeting in six years with warmth and progress. Beneath the diplomatic niceties, three major business takeaways stood out. 2. The rise of the rolling layoff. Companies like Amazon and Paramount Skydance have conducted multiple rounds of layoffs recently, leaving some employees relieved that they held onto their jobs but fearing they might be next. That can be pretty bad for morale and productivity. Here's why companies do it anyway. 3. Slop bowl stocks slump. Chipotle's stock fell 18% missing consensus Q3 revenue estimates. The fast-food chain revealed a significant decline in customer traffic among Gen Z and millennials, which prompted a reduced outlook. Competitors Sweetgreen and Cava also saw their stocks fall.

Title: Another tech giant’s gaming ambitions bite the dust | Opinion

The gutting of Amazon Games is tragic, but arguably a long time coming; like many tech giants, the company critically underestimated the complexity of succeeding in this market The gutting of Amazon's gaming division as part of a sweeping round of job cuts across the company is another blow to the already grim state of the games industry's employment market and career stability. It's not clear how many of the 14,000 jobs the giant company is cutting will be in its gaming subsidiaries, but it's flagged "significant role reductions" and a major turn away from developing big-budget titles. As awful as the impact of any major layoffs may be, this one has been a long time coming. By that I mean no disrespect to the no doubt hard-working and talented people whose lives are being dealt hammer blows by these strategic decisions made far above their pay grades; Amazon’s studios' games featured a lot of genuinely great work, perhaps most notably on New World, an MMORPG title that’s now among those now slated for shutdown. Strategically, however, Amazon's entire flirtation with the notion of being a games company has been a decades-long comedy of errors. The world's largest and most powerful retailer and Cloud services operator has at every turn failed to leverage its market advantages or produce a coherent strategy that lasted for more than about five minutes. It's a testament to the incredible strength and growth of Amazon overall – driven first by its online retail business and more recently by Amazon Web Services – that the directionless bungling of its games-related efforts has survived so many restructures, U-turns, product cancellations, and leadership changes. However much was being spent on games, it could be waved away as a rounding error during the boom years – but the music was bound to stop sooner or later. With Amazon now battening down the hatches across the board, gaming's blessed existence as a muddled, loss-making hobby for the company has seemingly come to an end. What's extraordinary in all this is just how little Amazon has to show for all the time and effort it has expended on gaming. The company is of course one of the biggest gaming retailers in the world simply by virtue of being Amazon, but has failed to leverage that into any meaningful position in digital gaming. So poor has the company's performance on that front been that when a LinkedIn post from former Prime Gaming VP Ethan Evans surfaced in February, reflecting on the company's failure to disrupt Steam's dominance of the PC digital distribution market. The most common reaction was genuine surprise at the discovery that Amazon had actually been trying to compete with Steam in the first place. Everything Amazon did in this space was just so fragmented and temporary. Prime Gaming actually included a bunch of free games for Prime subscribers, but it's not clear how many subscribers even knew that – and the games you redeemed there were generally provided through third-party stores like GoG or Epic Games Store, not added to any kind of Amazon Games library. That service fluctuated between trying to be an actual games subscription service and instead being an offering of free currency packs for popular F2P games; now it's been folded into the Luna game streaming service, though the average Amazon customer would be hard pressed to notice that either service exists, let alone that they’ve merged. The contrast with how Amazon has approached Prime Video – a service that it seemingly genuinely believes in, with support right up to the top of the company, even when it's flinging ill-advised billions at Lord of the Rings shows nobody asked for – is instructive. When you search for a movie on Amazon, Prime Video results are front and centre; if you want to buy an actual DVD or Blu-Ray, you'll have to click your way through several screens letting you know that it’s available to watch for free, to rent, or to buy on the streaming service. Search for a game on Amazon, though, and you often wouldn’t get anything of the sort; at times it was quite possible to buy a game that was already available to you for free on Prime Gaming or Luna without ever once seeing information to that effect. For all the strategic errors that were undoubtedly made on the development and publishing side of Amazon Gaming, I don't think the company can really be faulted for failing to become the major publisher they wished to be. That's an exceptionally difficult thing to do and is well outside Amazon's core competencies (to wit, running a cloud platform, and dabbling in a little light retail on the side). The fact that some games – like New World – actually did turn out well and create a passionate, if not huge, fanbase is not a bad showing on that front, albeit apparently not a commercially viable business unit either. The total failure to leverage the company's scale and its dominance of cloud and consumer-facing retail into any kind of foothold in digital distribution or online gaming services, however, is almost impressive; especially when you consider that the company apparently thought it was mounting serious competition to Steam for all this time. As much as there were individual managers and executives responsible for the decision making at Amazon, and some of them made really bad choices along the way, I think it's more instructive to think about what happened here in terms of structural failure. After all, Amazon isn't alone in this failure. It's only a few years since we saw Google abruptly (if entirely predictably) throw its hands in the air and give up on its own once-grand gaming ambitions, with the Stadia streaming service being ditched and full refunds being issued for hardware and games for the platform. That's two of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" who have essentially burned their hands on the gaming stove in the past five years alone. Scale, finances, and tech dominance simply aren't enough to make it in what is, essentially, a creative industry that sometimes cosplays as a tech sector on weekends. Google wasn't willing to make the long-term commitment required to build a business in this sector, while Amazon seemingly lacked the coherent vision and high-level support required to leverage its actual competitive advantages on behalf of its gaming ambitions. At their core, though, I'd argue that both failures boil down to the same root cause. The cultures of both companies were simply ill-suited to the kind of management style that's needed to nursemaid complex, long-term, expensive creative projects to a successful fruition. The kind of intensive internal competition that has been a catalyst for success for many tech companies is disastrous for creative industries, where constructive collaboration always yields far better results in the long-term than Darwinian competition. With tens upon tens of billions of dollars currently floating around the games industry for gigantic acquisitions and mergers, the collapse of Amazon's gaming ambitions may be a very timely reminder that there are some things money can't buy – especially in the absence of a coherent strategy to spend it.

Title: This Stock Market Bubble Is Not Real (This 8% Dividend Proves It)

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days. I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too). When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy. Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market. Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring. Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI. In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX). While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy. This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second. At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors. Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield. That would be the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), which holds tech darlings like Broadcom, as well as top performers from other sectors, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Thanks to its well-crafted portfolio, ADX hasn’t just matched the stock market’s returns over the last decade—it’s beaten it. This is why, at CEF Insider, we’ve been holding ADX for almost the entire time shown on this chart (and we would’ve held it for the entire time if CEF Insider had launched in 2015, rather than in 2017). This outperformance is great—but so is the dividend. ADX has yielded around 9.5% over the last decade, thanks to the huge special payouts management issued at year-end. But in 2024, the fund changed its distribution plans, going with a more evenly spread payout tied to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Now, ADX’s regular distributions are more consistent and reliable. The fund pays about 8% now, largely because the stock price is up over 13% in 2025 (as prices rise, yields fall). But its total return including dividends is 21.7% for the year, as of this writing, again far ahead of the S&P 500, at 16.6%. In other words, this fund has outperformed over the short and the long term. Yet it still trades at a discount to NAV. ADX’s discount is now 8.3%, but it was over 10% at the start of the year (and was around 12% most of the time before that). With the fund’s high yield, market outperformance and smartly built portfolio, this discount is likely to disappear, especially as more money comes into stocks as bubble fears fade. If you buy ADX today, you can still lock in this discount, boosting your upside potential while also securing that healthy yield. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: This Stock Market Bubble Is Not Real (This 8% Dividend Proves It)

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days. I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too). When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy. Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market. Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring. Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI. In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX). While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy. This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second. At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors. Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield.

ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Key Takeaways -Tech gets a confidence boost -Some sector rotation is happening -Market still digesting Fed meeting Amazon.com and Apple are going to kick us off in a big way today as the market continues to drive higher. It is very encouraging to see two of the stalwarts of the market be the further drivers of the rally. In fact, Amazon.com crushed earnings as the closely watch AWS end of the company beat and helped round out a very solid earnings report. In the case of Apple, they beat on iPhone sales and gives great confidence to the overall market, but to the tech sector in particular. We will talk about earnings more in a bit. Let’s take a look at what happened in yesterday’s session. We saw the market stumble a bit yesterday as the tech stocks gave a much cloudier picture. Yesterday was a tale of two cities as Alphabet had a 2.5% gain on the day with a strong quarterly report. Much of this was driven by advertising and cloud businesses. These were two very widely followed areas by analysts and they certainly were happy with what they saw. When you put up $100 Billion in Quarterly Earnings that sends a large message. META Platforms, however, were the other end of the spectrum. The stock was down over 11% on the day. This was primarily due to concern over expenses rising faster than expected and a one-time tax charge of $16 Billion. One other stock that stumbled of note yesterday was Chipotle Mexican Grill which was down 18,2%, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500. The company reported a struggle with the 25–34-year-old cohort of customers (worth watching) and with that missed on the Quarter and lowered yearly outlook As we head to todays Halloween trading action, as mentioned Apple and Amazon have us off to a great start on the day. Some of the other earnings we wanted to mention are from the Energy Sector. Exxon Mobil Corporation reported earnings that slightly missed expectations and continued the lower year-over-year trend. Much of that is due to the lower price of Crude Oil and the stock is down slightly. Chevron Corporation is mostly unchanged as the earnings also fell year over year, but they did top estimates The other things to watch all revolve around the rotating of Investor expectations. That is one of the things that many have pointed out is a seeming rotation by some of the large firms from an incredibly strong weighted tech sector to the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors. We also have a seeming “trade truce” between the US and China. We know that this is a fragile partnership and one that has the investing community nervous. The last one to keep in mind is the constantly changing probabilities of a December rate cut after the Fed comments on Wednesday. This will be a constant subject for us to visit over the next few weeks as Investors try to digest what this means. As always stay with your long-term Investment goals and stick with your trading plan Have a Happy and Safe Halloween!

Title: North Road Restructures International As President Jan Frouman Exits Amid Layoffs In London

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Change is once again afoot at Peter Chernin’s North Road Company with international President Jan Frouman exiting after three years as part of a restructure in London. Frouman, who left last month, is one of a number who has exited North Road’s London base, we understand. Several more junior staff were laid off. Frouman will not be replaced like-for-like and his place leading North Road’s international scripted efforts will be taken by L.A.-based North Road President Scott Manson along with the North Road scripted teams and Chernin Entertainment. The UK hub of North Road label Kinetic Content, which opened earlier this year in London under Too Hot to Handle co-creator Laura Gibson, is staying put and continues to build, insiders said. Related Stories Executives Chernin Entertainment Elevates David Ready To President Of Film As Jenno Topping Inks New Deal With Company News Caroline Hollick Exits North Road After A Year Frouman, a former Red Arrow Studios boss and head of Will Smith’s Westbrook International, was hired by Chernin in 2022 as Chernin formed North Road and paid $200M for Red Arrow Studios’ U.S. assets including Love is Blind producer Kinetic. Frouman’s LinkedIn indicates that he left North Road last month and has since become a strategic advisor to Israeli studio Sipur, a long-term partner of North Road’s. North Road declined comment. Watch on Deadline Frouman was President of international at North Road since its inception and ran the operation from the UK capital. During his tenure, North Road worked on splashy international co-pros including Israeli shows Bad Boy and Heart of a Killer (both with Sipur), along with Brazil’s Suture. It also bought Turkish indie Karga Seven and Mexico’s Perro Azul, while overseeing the opening of Kinetic’s UK hub. North Road was consistently rumored to be in the running for bigger international M&A plays such as All3Media but these did not come to pass and at times things have felt slow-going internationally, while high-profile executives such as Kristin Jones and Caroline Hollick exited during Frouman’s tenure. A number of his support staff have left in the past few weeks, we are told. In the U.S., North Road is behind the likes of Ford v Ferrari, Love is Blind and The Last Dance. Upcoming projects include The Body and Man on Fire for Netflix. The news comes as yet another tortuorous round of layoffs hits the U.S., most recently at Paramount-Skydance, Amazon and Fifth Season, with redundancies expected to hit Paramount internationally imminently.

Title: International Insider: Doctor… Who?; Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest; Steve Coogan Settlement

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor Good afternoon Insiders, the clocks have gone back, but we move forwards. Max Goldbart here taking you through the week’s headlines. Sign up here. Doctor… Who? No Disney regeneration: One of this decade’s splashiest industry deals came to an abrupt end this week, as Disney confirmed what we’d all been waiting for and killed its Doctor Who co-production pact with the BBC after just two seasons, having spent circa-£150M ($200M) on the sci-fi series thus far. Deadline had teased this happening as long ago as last summer, and the reality, per our deep dive this week, was that Disney appeared to have regretted signing on the dotted line not long after it did so in 2022. At that time, the streamers were splashing the cash as they looked to beef up their platforms to take on the might of Netflix, but the open check book era ended as quickly as it began, as Bob Iger re-took the Disney reins and started scaling back. The show never quite rated for Disney+, neither did it garner awards buzz, and the period has also collided with something of a “woke” backlash as MAGA politics seeped into commissioning at the very top, which may have had an impact on a series that unashamedly places diversity front and center. All in all, Doctor Who is a quintessentially British show that was maybe not quite primed for a mainstream American Disney audience. For now, the BBC needs to carve a new path for The Doctor, one that will see its budget slashed by at least half unless it can find a new American partner, amid question marks over how long showrunner Russell T Davies will remain in the saddle (he is penning an Xmas special for 2026 but no news yet on further seasons). Keep an eye on this one – it’s been quite the ride in the TARDIS. Related Stories Executives YouTube TV Calls Disney "Unnecessarily Aggressive" In Carriage Talks, With "Antiquated View" Of Pay-TV Economics Executives YouTube TV Is Out To "Eliminate Competition", Disney Execs Tell Employees In Carriage Fight Update Israel Shut Out From Doc Fest Watch on Deadline IDFA sparks debate: The International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) stoked debate this week over its decision to exclude Israeli state-backed organizations and films from every aspect of its 2025 edition amid growing international condemnation of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The event – which is the biggest documentary festival in Europe, if not the world – is the first major film festival to make such a move. It marks a blow for Israel’s mainly left-leaning documentary community, which has found itself increasingly isolated on the world stage following the launch of a boycott pledge in September, which has since been signed by close to 2,000 high-profile figures from the film world. IDFA’s new Artistic Director, Isabel Arrate Fernandez, told Deadline that the decision to bar Israel state funded orgs and films was not tied to that pledge, but rather in keeping with the festival’s new ‘Principles and Guidelines’. The decision has been greeted with dismay by many Israeli documentary professionals who point to their tradition of documenting and critiquing Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians, as well as the efforts of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to shut them down. “We will continue to make films, even if we have to film them on our cell phones and screen them in our living rooms,” Michal Weits, the Artistic Director of IDFA-barred festival DocAviv, told Deadline. Steve Coogan’s Settlement “Defamation David and Goliath”: In the world of entertainment, truth and fiction often blur. When this results in a courtroom battle, the public (and press) tends to pay attention. Following on from the high-profile Baby Reindeer suit (still to be resolved), headlines came Monday when Steve Coogan’s Baby Cow and Pathé paid “substantial damages” to a university professor who accused them of defaming his character in a pic about the search for King Richard III’s remains. A title card has also been added to The Lost King’s credits noting the portrayal of Richard Taylor is fictional. Taylor said representation of him and his behavior towards Philippa Langley (played by Sally Hawkins) in the movie was damaging. Coogan and co had to pay out, but the film’s creator and star was adamant that he didn’t really do anything wrong, as he pointed out in a Guardian op ed that the film has barely been altered and that potential star witness Langley was too ill to attend court. These fallouts are always interesting to follow as they raise questions around poetic licence, fictional representation and that good old fashioned “based on a true story” disclaimer that we audiences are oh so familiar with. Taylor’s action and Coogan’s response could set a precedent for many a movie to come. Japanese Animation Goes Big “New Cool Japan Strategy”: Good news for Japanese animation this week as our Asia expert Liz Shackleton brought news of record revenue. Last year, Japan’s animation industry grew by 14.8% to hit a whopping ¥3.8TR ($25BN), a mighty figure for an industry that has long punched well above its weight with fans from all over the world. Encouragingly, the report from the Association of Japanese Animations found that much of the rise came from overseas markets, which accounted for 56% of the total. Overseas revenue for Japanese animation first overtook local in the early pandemic era, colliding with global streaming platforms starting to accelerate distribution of Japanese anime overseas. Japan’s government is positioning anime and related media as a core industry under its ‘New Cool Japan Strategy’, setting a rather ambitious target of reaching ¥20TR ($130B) by 2033. Paramount Layoffs Never painless: We all know that M&A is never painless. This week, pain hit the newly-minted Paramount-Skydance, as around 1,000 employees were let go – mainly in Hollywood – a move that will likely impact international over the coming weeks. Few departments were spared, with staffers let go across news, movies, TV and back office. As Insider goes to press, the international fallout is beginning to be felt. Along with 100 layoffs in the U.S., CBS News is closing its bureau in Johannesburg, and its Race & Culture Unit – established in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd – is being eliminated. Meanwhile, we revealed last night that Lisa Kramer, the LA-based President, International TV Licensing at Paramount Global Content Distribution, will exit. The popular distribution executive was a mainstay at international markets and will be sorely missed. Long-serving SVP, Comms, Jennifer Weingroff, and Tony Augi, finance head for the distribution business, have also been let go. Paramount-Skydance wasn’t the only one making deep cuts. Amazon MGM Studios and Fifth Season have also initiated redundancy programs, as has North Road in London, with international president Jan Frouman exiting. With the spotlight on a Warner Bros. Discovery sale and Netflix throwing its exploratory hat in the ring, there could be more pain to come as media giants continue to synergise. The Essentials 🌶️ Hot One: Quentin Tarantino has landed his biggest role in nearly 30 years in feature Only What We Carry opposite Simon Pegg, Sofia Boutella and Charlotte Gainsbourg. 🌶️ And another One: Rita Ora and Ella Purnell are leading the voice cast of Harald Zwart’s animated viking girls adventure ViQueens. 🤖 New column klaxon: Jake is penning Rendering, reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz alongside our regular TechLine newsletter.

Title: WTI Crude Slips Toward Weekly Loss on Persistent Supply Fears

In a vacuum, such data would normally ignite buying interest, particularly as tight product inventories suggest firm demand heading into year-end. However, price action told a different story. The market responded tepidly, underscoring the weight of broader supply concerns and signaling that short-term inventory shifts are not enough to reset sentiment. OPEC+ Output Strategy Continues to Pressure Market Tone Bearish pressure intensified as it became increasingly likely that OPEC+ will move forward with an additional production increase of 137,000 barrels per day in December. This would follow a series of gradual output hikes already totaling over 2.7 million bpd since earlier this year. While not massive in isolation, the planned increase reinforces the perception that major producers are confident supply is sufficient — even in the face of subdued demand expectations. The group’s formal decision, expected at its upcoming meeting, is being closely watched. While the market is not anticipating a reversal, any indication of restraint could offer relief. For now, the bias remains toward looser policy and an expanding supply backdrop. Russia Sanctions Create Noise, But No Physical Tightness Yet Earlier optimism tied to fresh U.S. sanctions on Russian oil majors quickly faded. Although some key buyers in India and China paused new purchases, analysts noted that Russian flows remain uninterrupted. Lukoil’s decision to divest international assets was the most visible response, but materially, no disruption in seaborne supply has occurred. With Russia continuing to offer discounts and utilize shadow shipping fleets, traders are increasingly treating the sanctions as headline noise rather than a meaningful constraint. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reinforced this view, noting that ample global spare capacity continues to buffer the system against minor geopolitical disruptions. US-China Trade Truce Seen as Symbolic, Not Structural Markets briefly found support following a modest thaw in U.S.–China trade relations. In exchange for China resuming U.S. soybean purchases and committing to fentanyl enforcement and rare earth exports, Washington agreed to reduce tariffs for one year. While the deal was initially welcomed as a step in the right direction, it lacked depth. Analysts characterized it as a truce rather than a turning point, and crude traders largely agreed. The absence of structural reform or long-term trade clarity meant there was little basis to revise demand forecasts materially higher. In effect, the agreement softened downside risk without generating fresh upside momentum. Fed Rate Cut Adds Macro Support, But Momentum Is Lacking The Federal Reserve’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday offered a mild boost to risk sentiment. Lower borrowing costs are typically supportive for energy demand and broader commodity markets. However, the Fed hinted this may be its final cut of the year, citing government shutdown risks and a murky fiscal outlook. While the move aligns with a more accommodative global policy stance, especially as Europe and Japan keep rates on hold, the macro signal was not strong enough to overcome fundamental oil-specific concerns. With global GDP still struggling for traction, the impact on crude demand expectations remains limited. Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures Trend Indicator Analysis Light crude oil futures are in a position to close lower for the week after failing to follow through to the upside, following last week’s dramatic closing price reversal bottom. As of Thursday’s close, the market is trading $60.57, down $0.93 or -1.51%. On the upside, traders are facing its first major resistance level at the 52-week moving average at $62.29. Two minor resistance points come in at $62.50 and $62.59. Overcoming the latter will confirm the reversal bottom, but the market will still face headwinds at the long-term pivot at $63.74. We believe this price is the potential trigger point for an acceleration to the upside, with $65.95 the first target. Meanwhile, the inability to overcome the 52-week moving average will indicate that bearish traders are defending against an upside breakout. This could lead to a test of a 61.8% level at $59.44. Prices could collapse to $55.96 if the Fib level fails as support. As far as our trend indicator is concerned, we’re going to go with the 52-week moving average again. The market remains below the 52-week moving average, keeping the short-term trend bearish as we approach Friday’s open. Weekly Technical Forecast The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending November 7, 31 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $62.29. Bullish Scenario Recovering and sustaining a move over the 52-week moving average will signal the return of buyers. This move could lead to a confirmation of the previous week’s closing price reversal bottom and a bullish breakout over $63.74. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under the 52-week moving average will indicate the presence of sellers. This could fuel a sharp break into $59.44, while opening up the possibility of a retest of $55.96. Fundamental Outlook: Bearish Bias Holds with Market Awaiting Fresh Catalyst WTI crude is set to post a weekly loss heading into Friday’s session, with fundamentals offering little reason for buyers to step back in. Despite a strong U.S. inventory draw and easing trade rhetoric, the broader narrative remains centered on oversupply and policy uncertainty. OPEC+ signaling fresh output increases, and the limited impact of sanctions on Russian flows continue to weigh heavily. Unless the market receives a clear catalyst — whether from surprise OPEC+ restraint, a meaningful shift in geopolitical posture, or a sharp improvement in demand expectations — sentiment is unlikely to shift. Traders should continue to monitor key value areas for signs of demand re-engagement, but in the absence of conviction buying, the path of least resistance remains lower. Technically, trader reaction to the 52-week moving average at $62.29 sets the tone for the week. As of Thursday’s close, the market is on the weak side of this indicator, putting Light Crude Oil Futures in a weak or bearish position. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Amazon’s latest layoffs are not about AI replacing jobs
URL: https://www.verdict.co.uk/amazon-job-lay-offs/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:36:54Z
Full Content:
On October 28, 2025, Amazon announced it would lay off around 14,000 of its corporate workforce, potentially increasing to 10% of the total global corporate workforce or more than 30,000 employees in 2026. In the announcement, senior vice president of the company’s HR team, Beth Galetti, emphasised the role of AI in changing company operations, stating, “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before.” Some have taken this to mean that Amazon is replacing corporate workers with AI tools. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more However, the truth is not so straightforward. AI cannot directly replace Amazon’s corporate employees because it is not advanced enough yet to replace entire job roles. However, skyrocketing demand for AI solutions, combined with other factors like the tech hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed to Amazon’s decision to focus on maintaining financial health while increasing its AI spending. Accelerated demand for digital solutions, ecommerce, video streaming, and other online services during the Covid-19 pandemic sparked a hiring spree across the tech industry. At the time, Big Tech saw the increased use of digital services by businesses and consumers as the new normal. This led Amazon to invest heavily in its technology business, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), and grow its workforce significantly. In 2021, Amazon added more than 300,000 full- and part-time workers, taking its total headcount to 1.6 million people. Based on the October 28 announcement, it is estimated that around 80% of the roles cut are in Amazon’s entertainment arm and in operations (HR, recruitment, advertising, marketing, and ecommerce functions) across other Amazon businesses. While these roles are heavily at risk of being automated by AI agents, there is no clear evidence that Amazon is replacing these roles with AI. In reality, Amazon is doubling down on its AI investments as a key corporate priority and needs to cut costs to maintain profitability. Beth Galetti’s statement highlighted the company’s desire to be “organised more leanly.” It should come as no surprise that Amazon is betting heavily on AI. According to Goldman Sachs, AI will drive a 165% increase in data center power demand by 2030. As the world’s largest public cloud provider, AWS is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for data center usage. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. AWS is Amazon’s most profitable business unit, making up 58% or around $40bn of Amazon’s total operating income in 2024 despite contributing just 17% of net sales. Despite this, its profit does not cover anywhere near the amount of investment Amazon requires to fulfill AI data center demand. The company intends to spend as much as $118bn in capital expenditure in 2025 alone. To keep up in the race for AI dominance, Amazon needs to increase investments in building data centers, develop graphics processing units (GPUs) with improved computing power, and buy GPUs when it cannot manufacture them fast enough. To do this, the company must keep borrowing capital, which requires strong financial health and a substantial cash flow. Amazon’s executives and investors see corporate restructuring and the resulting layoffs as necessary to keep the company’s financial health in check. So, is AI the reason for Amazon’s latest layoffs? The answer is yes, but not in the way many have assumed. It’s true that, in June 2025, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told employees that increased use of generative and agentic AI would lead to job cuts. “As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy said in a memo to staff. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today”. While AI can already automate some corporate tasks, it is not yet replacing human staff. However, the demand for AI solutions and cloud services to support AI development is directly responsible for the latest round of layoffs.

Title: How AMZN Stock Rises To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/31/how-amzn-stock-rises-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:31:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Following Amazon’s exceptional Q3 2025 earnings disclosed on October 30th, which saw the stock rise 12% in after-hours trading, the crucial question is: Is this the start of a significant surge that could elevate AMZN stock to $500 or more? It's certainly a possibility. Amazon announced earnings per share of $1.95, exceeding the expected $1.57—a 25% surprise that caught Wall Street completely off guard. Revenue reached $180.2 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, surpassing the $177.8 billion consensus forecast. But here’s the real highlight: AWS revenue skyrocketed 20% to $33 billion, representing the strongest growth since 2022 and outpacing analyst predictions of $32.4 billion. This isn’t just about exceeding expectations—it’s about AWS demonstrating that it can compete with Microsoft Azure’s 40% growth and Google Cloud’s 34% growth in the AI era. Why is this significant for the stock price? Because it directly tackles the primary issue hindering Amazon’s valuation. Before the earnings release, AMZN had only increased by 2.2% year-to-date while the S&P 500 gained 16%. Investors were concerned that Amazon was falling behind in the AI competition. These results show a different story. In the following sections, we will explore how AMZN stock could potentially double from this point. However, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding individual stocks like AMZN, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns over 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? In general, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; there’s less volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. How is Amazon's AI strategy structured? Unlike competitors who rely on partnerships, Amazon is developing its own infrastructure empire. The company has just launched Project Rainier—an $11 billion AI data center in Indiana equipped with more than 500,000 Trainium 2 chips specifically intended for training Anthropic’s Claude models. What differentiates this from Microsoft or Google’s strategies? Amazon is not just hosting AI—it is also manufacturing the hardware. AWS CEO Matt Garman indicated that the company spent nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures in the past 12 months. This vertical integration grants Amazon pricing power and margin growth that competitors find difficult to match. Can AWS maintain growth of 20% or more? The evidence suggests it can. Demand for AI computing from enterprises is escalating more quickly than supply. Amazon has increased its data center capacity by 3.8 gigawatts in a year—more than any other cloud provider. With Anthropic set to utilize 1 million Amazon chips by the end of 2025, AWS has secured significant revenue predictability. What is fueling Amazon's advertising growth? The figures present a compelling narrative. Ad revenue reached $17.7 billion in Q3 2025, reflecting a 22% year-over-year increase, building on the $56.2 billion annual run rate established in 2024. Amazon's distinctive role as both a retailer and a media platform offers unrivaled targeting capabilities that command premium pricing. How does this stack up against other high-growth sectors? While AWS receives much of the attention, advertising serves as Amazon’s hidden growth driver. The introduction of ads on Prime Video broadened inventory while retaining the valuable e-commerce data that boosts the effectiveness of Amazon's ads. This dual revenue stream strategy resembles successful technology giants like Google. For more, see – Amazon’s segment financials. And what about the main retail segment? Don't underestimate the foundation. Amazon's online store generated $247 billion in 2024, and $67.4 billion in Q3 2025, accounting for 37% of total revenue. This segment isn't declining—its consistent cash flow is fueling the high-margin AWS and advertising growth that elevates valuation metrics. What needs to occur for Amazon to reach $500? Let’s analyze the scenarios. At the current price around $251 (post-earnings), Amazon is trading at approximately 35x trailing earnings. For the stock to double, we need either earnings growth, multiple expansion, or a combination of both. Can earnings double within 2-3 years? The trajectory indicates it is plausible. With AWS growing at over 20% alongside improving margins, advertising revenue potentially approaching $90-100 billion, and AI efficiencies enhancing operations, there is a pathway to over $11 per share in earnings—double the 2024 figures. Will the market accept premium multiples? This is where it becomes intriguing. If Amazon maintains its current 35x multiple on $11 earnings, that alone would elevate the stock to $385. However, companies driven by AI growth often command multiples of 40-50x. Applying a 45x multiple to $11 earnings would suggest a valuation of $495. What about the revenue growth narrative? Amazon’s guidance for Q4 2025 of $206-213 billion in revenue indicates that the company is on track for $900 billion in annual revenue within three years. This level of scale, combined with margin expansion due to AI investments, underpins premium valuations. Consider that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has exceeded its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presented an adaptable approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon’s Q3 2025 earnings signify a potential turning point. The combination of accelerating AWS growth, booming advertising revenue, and substantial AI infrastructure investments creates multiple avenues for significant stock appreciation. The calculations supporting a rise to over $500 aren’t speculative—they're based on sound business fundamentals. With AWS sustaining over 20% growth, advertising potentially reaching $100 billion, and AI fostering margin expansion across all sectors, Amazon possesses the revenue growth and profitability trajectory to justify premium valuations. The primary catalyst is investor recognition that Amazon isn’t falling behind in the AI race—it’s constructing the infrastructure necessary to lead it. Project Rainier and the Trainium chip initiative provide distinctive advantages that competitors cannot easily replicate. For investors with a 2-3 year horizon, valuations in the range of $400-500 seem achievable.

Title: How Much Does It Matter How Much Your Robotaxi Costs To Build?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/10/31/how-much-does-it-matter-how-much-your-robotaxi-costs-to-build/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T12:00:00Z

ByBrad Templeton, Senior Contributor. Tesla hopes to have a robotaxi, and has made serious efforts to make it cheaper to manufacture. Their pilot deployments, which are not yet robotaxis as they require full time human supervision, are done in stock Tesla models Ys, costing around $55,000 to retail customers. Most other players have paid minimal attention to cost, loading up vehicles with high-cost sensors and computing, with cost estimates over $150,000 per vehicle. This difference may, it turns out, mean little, at least for the first several years. Tesla says their Cybercab design, with 2 seats, no controls, just cameras for sensing and a Tesla-designed computing chip, with a minimalist interior, will be made for about $30,000. Baidu Apollo says their design, which is now in use costs $28,000 to build. Amazon’s Zoox uses a specialized custom design currently made in small volumes that will have a very high price to start. Waymo’s new Zeekr design uses a $40,000 base vehicle--or it was before Biden’s tariffs and now Trump’s--and is estimated to add $30,000 of gear. Their Hyundai design will be somewhat more. Tesla has also recently suggested that when they offer the Cybercab to retail customers, it will have a wheel and pedals. Vehicle cost (ie. depreciation per mile) is indeed the largest of several components of the “cost of goods sold” for a robotaxi, but it’s only about 25% of that cost. Other elements like depots, cleaning, charging, maintenance, insurance/crashes, customer service and remote ops and more add up to the rest. The COGS determine your gross margin. If somebody uses a vehicle that costs 25% more, it’s only going to increase the total COGS/mile by 7-10%. In a mature, commodity market, this would either mean thinner margins, or slightly higher prices to customers. But we’re not in a mature, commodity market, and we won’t be for quite some time. Both because the technology is new and evolving, and because in many cities, there won’t be competition for years to come. (There won’t even be service for years to come in many towns. There are still mid-sized towns without Uber.) Where there is competition, price won’t be nothing, but it will be one of many factors. Companies that are using a more expensive vehicle will do so for a reason, usually a reason that seeks to attract more customers. Zoox’s custom vehicle is expensive, but it offers bidirectional driving, face to face seating and big side windows. Zoox hopes that customers will prefer their vehicle, even at a slightly higher price. Waymo’s Jaguars are luxury vehicles with leather seats, more like UberComfort or even UberBlack, which customers pay more for. Today, of course, the extra sensors and computing make an overwhelming difference. The companies with these sensors (notably LIDAR) have operating unsupervised robotaxis, and have for 6 years in the case of Waymo. Nobody without a LIDAR has a working robotaxi; they just hope to. You can’t get a bigger difference than that, and everybody hopes for what is a literal first mover advantage. If the cost is found in sensors and other digital electronics, we know what happens to the price of such things with time and scale--they plummet, and I mean really plummet, by orders of magnitude. With other car parts, it’s a miracle to make them 20% cheaper. With digital electronics it’s very strange if they don’t get 10 times cheaper, in some cases a billion times cheaper. Tesla is good at making cars, though the Chinese are better at making them cheaper. Only tariffs prevent the Chinese automakers from winning any price war, and that’s not a long term answer. There are a few other costs which can come down--Tesla hopes to reduce the cost of mapping, but that’s a very small component of the COGS. They are the leader in charging, though they have selected a totally new charging approach for the CyberCab, putting them on an even footing with the others who also must find automatic charging methods. Tesla hopes their all-camera approach will work. If it does, then the expensive sensors in all the working robotaxis no longer provide any advantage, they are cost with no benefit. The others bet that’s not the case. If their bet turns out to be wrong, the question will be how readily they can change their approach, and what it costs them. The attraction of the camera-only approach is that it is, in some ways, simpler, and mostly machine learning. Duplicating it will not be too hard for experienced companies, but testing and certifying will take time. They’ll have all the other components of a service in place, though, and of course their old technology will still be working, just costing more than it should, which investors must handle. At the price of current ride-hail services, which is around $2.50/mile, a dime in extra COGS isn’t a big isue. That changes in other markets. The biggest market for the technology is a subscription service which convinces customers to give up ownership of at least one car in favor of the subscription. Here price matters more, because the subscription must be priced competitively with private ownership, which cost around $12,000/year, plus parking, according to AAA. That’s pushing $1/mile, though it drops a lot as a car gets older. As long as the car and service are good, the lower the cost of building the car, the better. This is also true for privately owned self-driving cars, where drivers are cost sensitive, and base hardware costs are usually tripled in retail costs. Making a consumer self-driving car is much harder than making a robotaxi, and while a few have intentions, nothing is solidly on the horizon other than Tensor’s high-end vehicle (unless you believe Elon Musk’s normally wrong predictions.) Indeed, Tesla said for years their HW3 cars had all the necessary hardware but have walked that back. This market comes later, and gets big even later. Robotaxis come sooner, but at first, they are not competing on price, in fact they’re probably not competing that much at all, instead being the only vehicle in a given city until there are multiple strong players going after each other. Years from now, as competition heats up, vehicle cost will start to play a competitive role, but everybody’s vehicles, computers and sensors will all look fairly different by then, too.

Title: Meta’s $27 billion bet turns AI compute into Wall Street’s hottest new investment
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/metas-27-billion-bet-turns-ai-compute-into-wall-streets-hottest-new-investment/
Time Published: 2025-10-31T11:45:48Z
Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Are data centers the new REIT? Not quite — but Meta’s new mega–data center in northeast Louisiana marks what one expert calls a “decisive shift” in how hyperscalers finance the AI era: by turning data centers into a new investable asset class. “This is where capital markets meet compute,” said Sean McDevitt, a partner at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, which provided commercial due diligence advice to Meta. Traditionally, tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft have funded their data center buildouts directly. This time, Meta is partnering with Blue Owl Capital, a private-credit investment firm, on the $27 billion data center known as Hyperion. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Blue Owl owns 80% of the project, while Meta holds 20%, operating and leasing the facility long-term. BlackRock bought more than $3 billion of bonds that the joint venture (dubbed Beignet) issued last week to finance the project, in a sale arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal stands out for its scale—the largest private-debt offering ever—and for its A+ rating from S&P, which reflects Meta’s backing of the project (albeit with just a single agency rating). Yet the debt had a yield of 6.58% at issue, a level closer to high-yield, or “junk,” bond territory. That structure allows Meta to build its data center without putting the full $27 billion of debt on its own balance sheet. The approach—known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) or off–balance-sheet financing—is largely new territory for hyperscale infrastructure. “By being able to access outside capital, you’re not limited to your own free cash flow generation,” McDevitt said. “You’re bringing on investors with return profiles on an infrastructure-type investment that allows companies to build bigger, larger, quicker, and faster.” He compared it to taking out a mortgage: you can buy a bigger house—or, in this case, build more data centers—by borrowing instead of paying cash up front. McDevitt believes the Hyperion deal could become a template for the industry. He estimates that roughly $150 billion in AI-driven data center construction is coming in the next few years. If other hyperscalers—Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI among them—adopt similar models, capital markets rather than tech companies themselves will effectively fund the infrastructure of the AI era. “This is replicable,” he said, though he cautioned that it remains to be seen how the project performs in practice. “Now what has to happen? Meta has to build this thing, then put workloads in it and operate under the presumption that they’ll monetize those computing loads driven by AI in the future,” McDevitt added. That is precisely where criticism of the deal lies: According to Global Data Center Hub analysis, “If AI workloads or margins stumble, these SPVs could echo the dark-fiber overbuild of the 1990s vast capacity sitting idle while debt remains outstanding.” Still, for now, there’s no reason to think other major banks won’t try the same thing, said McDevitt. “Why wouldn’t others look to mimic [this deal]?” Sharon GoldmanX: @sharongoldmanEmail: sharon.goldman@fortune.com Submit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.

Title: Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt? Indian-origin CEO under BlackRock's radar for ‘breathtaking’ $500 million scam in US?

An Indian-origin CEO is at the heart of a $500 million scam that targeted the world’s biggest investment group BlackRock’s private-credit investing arm and other lenders, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. According to the WSJ report, BlackRock’s private credit investment arm, HPS Investment Partners, are now trying to recover the money after falling victim to what it calls a ‘breathtaking’ fraud. Bankim Brahmbhatt, the owner of US-based Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, has been accused of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral. The lawsuit, filed in August, alleges that HPS had provided loans to Brahmbhatt's companies on the condition that they pledged millions of dollars owed by customers as collateral for the money. The lenders have now accused that Brahmbhatt’s companies owe them more than $500 million. BlackRock has also claimed that when the verification process of the account receivables started, it was found that the funds from the loan was diverted offshore accounts in India and Mauritius. According to the WSJ report quoting people familiar with the matter, BNP Paribas helped BlackRock’s HPS Investment Partners finance the loans to Brahmbhatt's companies. HPS, which was bought earlier this year by BlackRock, started lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020. Since the case was filed in August, several companies linked to Brahmbhatt including New York-based invoice financing firm Carriox Capital, have since filed for Chapter 11 protection in the US. Meanwhile, the lenders in their lawsuit said that Brahmbhatt had used fake invoices, contracts and emails over the past two years to make it appear as if the money was owed to established telecom companies. “Brahmbhatt created an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,” lawyers for the lenders wrote. Following its initial 2020 credit, HPS hiked the amount of its debt investment to about $385 million in early 2021, and then to around $430 million in August 2024. Nearly half of the loan to Brahmbhatt’s Carriox and affiliated entities were financed by BNP Paribas, the people quoted by WSJ said. According to the report, an HPS employee in July had noticed the irregularities with certain email addresses that purportedly came from Carriox customers. That led to suspicions, with HPS officials enquiring Bankim Brahmbhatt about the alleged irregularities. At the time, the businessman had assured them nothing was wrong, but later stopped picking up their calls. When an HPS employee visited the offices of Brahmbhatt in New York's Garden City in July, they were found to be closed. On Wednesday, office suite was locked and appeared vacant, and nobody answered the bell at his listed residence in Garden City. Two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi were seen parked in the driveway, and a package next to the front door lay unattended. HPS has told some clients they believed Brahmbhatt is in India, according to the report. Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder of Bankai Group, and has been in the telecom industry for over three decades. His companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice sell services and infrastructure to other telecom companies. The LinkedIn account of Bankim Brahmbhatt seemed to be deleted when Mint tried to access it. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

It sounds like a cool sort of buzzword from the now generation but you have the phrase ‘at sixes and sevens’ that goes back many, many centuries so this is just a new variation of a very old phrase- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sixes_and_sevens One of my favorite authors titled one of his works of amazing short stories: ‘Sixes and Sevens’ Enjoy some timeless tales of O. Henry therein: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2851/2851-h/2851-h.htm Another recent thing kids said, skibidi, also sounded very like a certain type of old time comedy – Ish Kabibble, for instance. Vaudevillians and hep cats never made it to the dictionary. Copacetic being a rare exception. Then a long gap until enbiggens and cromulent. Now these stunts. I don’t really care. In my elementy school, we used an otherwise perfectly normal word in a similar way for a couple of years. I’d imagine we were not unique among fourth and fifth graders. It was kind of like the soup time meme kids were doing a few years ago. If anyone is interested in origins fo skibidi.

National Guard in each state is ordered to create ‘quick reaction forces’ trained in civil unrest AP Border Patrol takes lead role in Trump administration’s Chicago crackdown, carrying out more arrests than ICE CBS News ICE Is Now Wandering the Streets, Scanning People’s Faces to Check If They’re Citizens Futurism ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Everything is going down in lefty Big Smokes, feel pretty safe here in Tiny Town where we are politically right smack dab down the middle and surrounded by a sea of red down in Godzone. A local wag calls us ‘Caucasian Island’ as Haoles make up 91% of the population. That said, i’m reading reports in regards to ICE/NG being seen on the streets in nearby Woodlake, which has about 10k people and is 87% Hispanic. I drive by orchards all the time, and how can you tell in a drive-by how the workers are feeling, but it doesn’t seem any different-the way they go about doing things, there’s about 25 cars parked in front of the orchard, a few port-a-potties, a couple of 10×10 popup shade structures and a mess of ladders to be able to pick oranges on high. It’d be so easy to round them up~ Trump has got over three more years in office. Plenty of time for ICE to eventually get around to smaller places like those orchards near you unfortunately. Once you create a monster organization like ICE you cannot keep them idle but must be always be sending them off to new areas to harass. They had a veteran’s parade yesterday in Fayetteville NC. “All the forces were represented”. Well no. there were no face covering ICE agents waving from the floats. That little detail escaped the TV coverage…. So no future ‘Thank you for you service’ coming anytime soon? The 97 year old owner of a cabin near me passed on last year and his 30 something grandson inherited it from him, and over the summer he’s been up half a dozen times, and each sojourn he tells me that he’s a military combat veteran about 4 or 5 times. On one side 99% of the population has nothing to do in terms of being in the military, and on the other side the 1% never lets you forget it. “Thank me for my service” Thank him for letting himself be used. losing the use of his legs(t-7, i think) by being used for bullshit geopolitical shenanigans is what rumbled my stepdad Don’s stomach ever after. he was the biggest antiwar person i have ever known…and when my boys played whatever that combat vidgame was and started talking about joining the marines, because it would be awesome, i sat them down on his front porch with him for an afternoon…and all that nonsense just kinda went away. My army service began 1959. I never left the United States. Yes, I served but then the draft said I had no choice. I was not an enthusiastic soldier, but I did my duty. No pats on the back required. I considered myself fortunate to have been too young for Korea and too married and a father for Vietnam. Many many years later in circumstances that escape me, I was asked if I have served in the military. I said yes. This bright eyed young person said, “Thank you for your service.” Inwardly, I recoiled. It felt the same to me as hearing, “Have a nice day.” I did what I was asked to do and required to do. Leave it at that. Wondering if the airlines will include announcements for ICE & CBP in their preboarding of :Active Duty US military “ More likely that sooner or later that Trump will declare a national ICE Day so they know that they are appreciated. That one is worthy of starting a pool !! Vegas Book—What day/ year will the holiday be created? I’m thinking Labor Day will be repurposed too, and any expectant mother that delivers on that day, gets a $100 gift card from Amazon. ICE really needs dress uniforms! Something inspired by Hugo Boss from the 30’s, in black. With the Nike Swoosh on the collar instead of lightning bolts. And medals, too. Lotsa medals. methinks those red or black Sith robes would be more apropos… Oh no! Roundup Ready braceros! A new wonder tool for Big Ag. It is widely known that more people die from cold than heat. According to ScienceDirect, “In most epidemiological studies, excess cold deaths far outnumber heat deaths.” https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519625000543 Thus, the report from BioScience which mentions rising temperatures will be harder to convince those who are more comfortable as temps rise, to do something now, only for it to be too late to do much when extreme temperatures arrive in the future. ” Historic U.S. Civil War Ship Decaying Due to Fungal Invasion ” I think that there is only one real long term solution here. Remove the old planking and arrest any fungi, perhaps by having those planks frozen for future research. Then replace those removed planks with hardy timber treated to resist any future fungi infestations. Of course eventually that may leave you with the Ship of Theseus quandary- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus Remember too that this ship was built during the US Civil War as a temporary class of ships and would normally have been scrapped after war’s end- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cairo The scientists working on the restoration might want to look into using Chlorine Dioxide as a fumigant. A ship is sort of a building, sort of. / ‘) Effect of Chlorine Dioxide Gas on Fungi and Mycotoxins Associated with Sick Building Syndrome https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1214660/ thanks, Flora! not sure how i could apply such a gas to my house, tho…the july 4th rain event left me with mold, galore. ive sprayed 3 times with a diluted pinesol in a hand pump sprayer. my poor roofing skills are generally tolerable, save for such events(30+” in 36 hours or so) it is a whole world away from where it was right after the event when the sun came out, though… i dont wake up as a snot monster when i stay in the hammock out here at the wilderness bar. I think that is what is being done with the USS Constitution–thete’s a grove maintained by the Navy to supply timber for maintaining the ship, too. So the relevant skills and resources are not lacking. i hafta say, maintaining a grove for such things is rather cool. i support such uses of my tax dollars. Add to that the Navy Experimental Hemp Plantation to the north of Meridian, Mississippi. As the boys down at the supply house like to say: “Your tax dollars at rest.” This reminds me of a story from Gregory Bateson that I read several decades ago in either a Whole Earth Catalog or a CoEvolution Quarterly Magazine article. And I find an online article making a referrence to that story and then offering some background and context around it. It is titled: ” Oak Beams, New College Oxford The beams of the New College, Oxford dining hall come with an amazing story. ” Here is the link. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oak-beams-new-college-oxford As a person who lives very close to the border in Imperial County CA and has regular interactions with the Border Patrol agents, I can tell you that we are all happy to see these a–holes going somewhere else. I am sorry for the people inland who they harass, but at least they are not here in the constitution free zone causing traffic accidents (they drive like maniacs) and annoying the locals, many of whom have family on both sides of the wall. The BP here are overstaffed, no one is crossing in this area, so the agents mostly sit in their cars where there is a signal and watch porn. Occasionally they get restless and go forth to bother whoever they can. God protect us from bored cops.

What would an isolated America look like that has 800 military bases within the country to hold the people in check? The Liberfascistarian Republic of North Koreamerica. “Losing the Swing States” Would that everything the authors dread come to pass — a consummation devoutly to be wished … Interesting headline on this Axios article, paywalled. Democrats’ rift with unions erupts as shutdown pain worsens https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/democrats-unions-labor-trump-shutdown-airlines Teamsters, too, once true-blue. Um, the “Swing States” in today’s link featuring that title are members of the BRICs So these unions are happy to see a hundred million other Americans lose their health care due to sudden unafordability at every level so they can get back on the federal job sooner. Just as the teamsters and others are happy to double or triple the speed of global warming for everyone else so they can have “good jobs at good wages” in the meantime. The solidarity candle burns at both ends. Is the Democrat leadership continuing the shutdown because they fear that the huge premium hikes on voters’ health insurance will lead the voters to abandon Obamacare in favor of Medicare for all? The Democratic leadership is not leading the shutdown. The Total-Three-Branches ownership-and-control Republican leadership is leading the shutdown, to prevent swearing Grijalva in so as to keep putting off the discharge petition to get the Epstein Files released so as to keep protecting our Pedophile President Donald ” The Groomer” Trump. Democrats’ insisting on extending the Obamacare subsidies is just Grindr Mike’s pretext and excuse. South Korea’s 30-year quest for nuclear subs pays off. What comes next? Breaking Defense South Korea needs nuclear subs even less than Australia. Have you asked the South Koreans why they want these submarines? Do you think you can manage to convince them that you are right and they are wrong? the waters around the Korean peninsula are not deep. (electro-diesel subs can achieve the same goals for a lot less money) If looking through the prism of purely Korean defense, nuclear-powered attack subs are a ego-driven boondoggle—just like their Establishment’s drive a few years back to have a blue-water carrier strike group like France or the UK. Western Europe might have grown tired of being a US vassal—not the Korean establishment. Even their “left-wing” current president is as fervent pro-vassal as his right-wing predecessor. Not necessarily – the Chinese appear to be investing in relatively small shallow water nuclear attack submarines to replace their Kilo class subs. Its not clear what their purpose is, but it may be that they see value in having them hide in the canyons of the South China Sea for longer periods than is possible for AIP. The Koreans may have similar ideas. Their most recent subs are capable of launching medium range ballistic missiles such as the Hyumoo 4 – the thinking seems to be to ensure that they can sit off shore North Korea (or unnamed other local adversaries) to maintain the ability to carry out rapid decapitation strikes. A key element of RSK strategic thinking appears to be a focus on a very rapid and precise counter-strike on key underground bunkers in the event of an attack. And South Korea is nowhere near a vassal. They have proven very adept at using the US defence umbrella to follow their own strategic objectives in both politics and economics. This move is highly likely to be part of an overall policy of becoming a key defence supplier to the US (i.e. making the US dependent on them as a supplier). Nothing says “nowhere near a vassal” like jumping on the Ukrainian bandwagon, and pushing North Korea right into the arms of Mother Russia. Some might consider it the best gift Kim Jong Un could wish for (and one of acts of self harm that US vassals are ritually engaging in), though it must be a sly 4D chess move by totaly-not-a-vassal, and a part of some convoluted South Korean gambit. Launching rapid decapitation strike is where it’s at, expecially when you know for sure that nukes will be boomin’ back atcha. Who’s the enemy for the S Koreeans? An enemy that necessitates nuclear subs? The depth of the water is completely irrelevant to what power plant a sub uses…. No one asks South Koreans what they want. That’s the whole problem with being a vassal. As far as convincing goes, wise man say that it’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. I do think that South Koreans are smarter than Ukrainians, and that they might figure things out by themselves before they run out of people. Who cares what yankee slaves want? They’re standing in opposition to the legitimate government of the Korean people. Long live the Democratic People’s Republic. I have. Then I realized I am not a Korean any more. The Rev Kev is needed here, so that we can make a final judgment on who needs nuclear subs more. South Korea’s nuclear subs are a commodity — Canada, which needs nuclear subs even less than just about anyone, wants to appease Trump by spending an absurd 5% of GDP on defence, but doesn’t want to be seen as rewarding the US for its blackmail, is looking to buy some. And it probably makes sense to buy something that likely will actually work. Well, Canada used to need to patrol it’s ice covered Northern coast. Now, by the time the new boats are built, there may not be any ice left…. re: Yes, Everything Crashed–Just Not For You Charles Hugh Smith An American physician with nearly 50 years of experience brought me up short when he reported that for many Americans, the healthcare they receive is equivalent to what third-world residents receive. The algorithm serves me up quite a lot of videos of Americans who have moved overseas to so-call third world countries (mostly in Central America) and the medical care they describe sounds dreamy compared to the US. It’s cheap, with lots of face time with actual doctors, and with a dearth of paperwork. Daniel Swain is a weatherman’s weatherman, there is really nobody like him, truly a climate savant (and I mean that in the nicest way) and so widely respected. Any kind of weather related event happens on the left coast, and he’s always quoted-as he’s the expert. Now aside from nabbing an operating system and calling it his own, what does Gates know about the climate in order to make such a declaration? Gates seems to know his own mortality. Just can’t get ‘enough’…? Re; New Not-So-Cold War/War?

Far from the worst-case scenario, this is pretty much the next best thing. I just re-read Immanuel Wallerstein’s World System Analysis. How do capitalists increase profit ? Externalize costs. Cut taxes. Reduce wages. The bottom 90%’s share has steadily declined since the 1970s. Tax cutting has been relentless. The EPA is under attack. That said, fire and rehire at lower wages is just part of the program. re: “Mass hunger approaching” and “National Guard in each state”…. Seems like I’m watching an orchestrated effort – by both parties – to run the Cloward-Piven strategy. The poor will be hurt…. again. The political question or calculation is: which party will be blamed for the pain and failure? Is this all about next year’s midterm elections? A game of political chicken? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward%E2%80%93Piven_strategy At some point, after then Dem Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill worked with Reagan to raise the SS retirement age to ‘pay for’ Reagan’s tax breaks to wealthier citizens, after Bill C ended “welfare as we know it” which increased poverty, and after Obama traded away an extension of unemployment benefits during the GFC to get a win on another issue, I began to think the Dem party no longer gives a toss about the poor, the unfortunate, or the mistreated. Scary interpretation is to brace for more horrible revelations about Dem spying, scandals, Biden dementia denial, self-dealing and so many other festering sores will lead to pitchforks and torches. The do-nothings just talk and line their pockets, like head grifter Pelosi, while constituents worry about getting food. You don’t hate all politicians enough.

Re: With mass hunger approaching as food stamps expire Saturday, huge price increases revealed for Obamacare healthcare plans Looks like family member’s plan has 50% increase in premium and the deductible doubled!!! awful — how is this cluster(care) not befouling Saint Obama’s image? rhetorical ? smh The rhetoric is calling the ACA ‘Obama Care’ where it is used as a smear to the democratic party alone, despite the fact that he signed into law – as opposed to veto – after the ACA had passed through house and senate (dems and repubs) – as is the usual course of things in the USA – for his signature. In other words, it was not just some idiot president tossing around executive orders as has become custumary over many decades of illusionary leadership. My view is that it largely passed because both the house and senate were captured by their true constituency -finance capitalism devoted to puffery and asset bubbles- and it was cleary stated with ill-defined sloganeering, or, should I say con-artistry (makeing things up where the mark/victim/target/voter is left to make the conclusion as to the true meaning of the art – most often given to believe that they are the true beneficiaries of aforesaid con-artistic statement) such as: government should be shrunk down to baby sized in order to more easily kill the baby in a bathtub, government should be run more like a business (failing, as always, to mention what type of business – monopoly business, fraudulent business, banking, private equity, widget production?- or that most businesses fail in the first five yrs), Regulation is making business to difficult so we have to deregulate businesses because the government is just to darned hard on them Jawbs – cut the red tape (of course they fail to disclose that the deregulation was mainly in the Financial services industry whose cliches included ‘making money the old-fashioned way’ ((not dislosing the ‘old-fashioned way’ -was the ‘way’ before Glass-Steagle closed down on fraud and speculation))), ‘Hope and change’ (not disclosing that what it meant was ‘ I sure as hell hope that nobody notices that nothing will change). Mexicans do jobs that Americans won’t do —of course, not mentioning that Americans won’t do those Jawbs because of the abject poverty wages and slave like conditions that are now coming to roost for americans because of asset inflation (cost of living increasing faster than income for that outgo)– maybe it’s a great way to force americans who are tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free into cheap labor for industrial faming……..I’m sorry, I forgot that the idea is to get rid of paid labor through automation, AI and bond servitude), MAGA – “Make America Great Again” … a little late to ask – For who? because the answer is the same as it has been for a long time…..“I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.” Thomas Jefferson “To achieve victory, high finance needs to disable government, which is the single power able to regulate, tax and otherwise curtail its expansion. To disable political democracy, finance buys control of the electoral campaigns so as to promote politicians acting as its officers. It also buys control of the television, radio and published mass media, and uses endowments to buy control of the academic process. Together, these are the various organs that represent the “brain” of society.” Michael Hudson We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace–business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me–and I welcome their hatred.” Election eve speech at Madison Square Garden (October 31, 1936) Franklin Delano Roosevelt The well spring of which was the Heritage Foundation, under the auspices as a free market solution – too public health care. Lambert and NC unpacked this long ago, he put on his yellow waders, devil in the details, fine print, and most of all the billion it took to launch a crappy internet platform and a hoard of barley qualified ACA guides.

I can’t wait for AI to be the new human resources manager/decision maker … sorta like in the Netflix show Barry … investors demand it … What do you call somebody on food stamps? …a Foodlatelist I give that pun the Stamp on Approval. “Russia offers temporary ceasefire for journalist access in Ukraine” Putin is playing it smart here. The Ukrainians have downplayed how serious it is in Pokrovsk and Kupyansk so by inviting journalists in, they would be able to report the true situation. Only it is not going to happen. The Ukrainians have said ‘I also remind all media that any visits to Russian-occupied territory without Ukraine’s permission are a violation of our legislation and international law. They will have long-term reputational and legal consequences. We are watching closely’ so they are threatening any journalists that might think of taking up the offer- https://www.rt.com/russia/627171-ukraine-journalists-safe-passage/ So something on the order of about ten thousand Ukrainian soldiers are about to fall into the Russian bag. And the Zelensky regime will demand that they must fight to the last and to sell their lives dearly or else it will make Zelensky look bad in the media. I may have misunderstood the reporting, but I think Russia is willing to stop firing so that reporters can travel in Ukraine. I don’t think that the reporters have any contact with the Russian army at all. So, it’s obviously not going to happen. But as you say Rev Kev, very clever on Russia’s part IMF is ready to ‘help’ Jamaica indeed. The carrion feeders probably froth at the mouth everytime any kind of crisis threatens outside of the G20. Also, the gleaner is a terrible outlet with a history of emotive reporting. They have articles that sound more like the excerpts from a YA crime thriller than actual news. That said, it might be impossible to find impersonal, worse critical, reporting in any Jamaican paper. The same seems to go for impartiality as well. There are plenty of non-profits stepping up to help. There is no need for these ghouls. They will likely demand austerity and charge interest on loans to the Jamaican government. Just say no! They will absolutely demand austerity but whether or not the govt cares to avoid it is anybody’s guess, I can only hope. One optimistic note is that the Clinton faction probably won’t be anywhere near Jamaica. Maybe. The Clinton’s may be more “deep state” than that. Despite being low hanging prosecution fruit, we’ve seen little noise on that front. Bill, eyeball deep in the Epstein affair. Hillary, SoS/top tier arms dealer, bribes funneled through the foundation bearing their name. They have been keeping a suspiciously low profile. Thanks for adding the quotation marks. My first thought when I saw the headline… “US Envoys Put Lebanese Army Under Watch” Those US envoys can say what they want but the Lebanese are not going to start a civil war by going after Hezbollah just to keep these goofballs and the Israelis happy. For a start, Hezbollah is better equipped than the Lebanese army because the west has always kept the Lebanese army weak so as not to worry the IDF. Same as in Jordan. In addition, Hezbollah has combat experience which the army does not really have. Another factor is that you have may families that have members in Hezbollah and the army so they won’t want to see any fighting. Finally, the Lebanese know that once Hezbollah is disarmed, that will be the signal for Israel to invade the country and occupy at least the southern half so that they can set up their Settlements there and make it part of Greater Israel. Those US envoys can pound sand. AI layoffs to backfire: Half quietly rehired at lower pay The Register As predicted here on NC, one of the few LLM success stories. It’s working exactly as intended. Per the House calendar, over the past three months, these jokers have only been in session for a grand total of 12 days. They took off the month of August, then worked a few days in September after Labor Day. Since September 19th, Mike Johnson has shut down the House to avoid swearing in Adelita Grijalva, the 218th vote for the discharge petition to force the release of the Epstein files. Maybe they should just stay home. It’s not like they care about the Constitution, or governing.

He used the opportunity to send a distress message confirming for the first time to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam. He repeatedly blinked his eyes in Morse code during the interview, spelling out the word “T-O-R-T-U-R-E”.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Denton NC Team, Are you going to post a take on the recent Dutch elections? “The US Can’t Break Russia” I found a very notable section in this article. So the CIA under Ratcliffe was giving Trump all those rosy evaluations that he wanted to hear but then analysts at the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research cleared their throat loudly and tried to give a more reality-based assessment. When Trump read their dissenting notes he was not happy. So analysts were fired or resigned and the organization disassembled with the remnants folded into other groups. With those dissenters gone, Trump was happy again as Ratcliffe once more spun him the latest fables. Idjut! Taibbi and Kirn. ATW. utube. public excerpt.

He’s like a Heidegger-lite. Taibbi probably should break up with him re: Israel constantly breaking it’s so-called ceasefire agreement Is it possible the Israeli military is out of control? Or perhaps that the military is in control of the country, not the politicians? That political civilian authority is effectively overuled by the military? ‘Hubrisrael’ I do not recall a cease fire that Israel did not unilaterally break and do so repeatedly. They should really come up with a new term to describe a one-sided ceasefire to explain what the Israelis do. I think that the Israelis have done about 4,000 attacks on Lebanon since the ceasefire for example but don’t quote me on that number. re: Israel’s ex-Mossad Chief brags they have spread “boobytrapped & manipulated equipment” like Hezbollah’s pagers in “all countries you can imagine” Witness the calibre of Mossad so-called intelligence. re: Burevestnik – Part I Black Mountain Analysis Can this miniature nuclear reactor be used to power cars, trucks, planes, houses, factories, data centers? Perhaps eventually also calculators, iphones, laptops? No, its power output (thrust) like that of all modern jet engines comes mostly from the expansion of compressed hence heated ambient air.

Bubble delicious How OpenAI Uses Complex and Circular Deals to Fuel Its Multibillion-Dollar Rise (NY Times via archive.ph) Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology. Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution. Why was 6 afraid of 7?

Pretty funny, as expected Trump just kneecapped the GOP’s shutdown strategy (CNN) After the government had been shut down for nearly a month, a conspicuously quiet President Donald Trump finally weighed in with a prescription for how to end it. Republican congressional leaders are probably wishing he hadn’t. Oh noes That Trump would call for this is not terribly surprising; he has spent years occasionally urging Republican leaders to scrap the filibuster. Nor is it particularly likely to provide an actual offramp in the shutdown; those same GOP leaders have steadfastly declined Trump’s entreaties before and rejected this idea repeatedly in recent weeks. It’s not even clear whether enough senators would vote for such a change if GOP leaders went along with it. So practically speaking, it’s a pointless interjection from the president. But it does matter in one way: It’s Trump yet again inserting himself into these kinds of talks in ways that are thoroughly unhelpful to his party. And this has become a trend. It is very unhelpful, because it demonstrates what people mostly don’t know — at any time, the Senate can just decide to pass legislation with a majority vote. Democrats very much don’t want Trump running his mouth about this, either, I bet. For one, it violates “norms” of the Senate, and Democrats worship norms above all else. And that’s one reason they find Trump so vulgar, I mean, tearing down parts of the Whitehouse, how dare he? Otherwise, they’re very much on board with Team Trump, not even having a reversal of the punitive cuts in the big beautiful pile of garbage as a minimum bid to vote to end the shutdown. Fun.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big Tech's AI gold rush isn't slowing down— it's getting more expensive. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all opened their wallets wider than ever this quarter, logging record-breaking capital expenditures on AI chips, servers, and data centers. Microsoft was the top spender at nearly $35 billion, narrowly beating Amazon. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company could increase its long-term asset spending, or capital expenditure (capex), by as much as 24% next year. Each company said it planned to spend even more on capex going forward. A few recent deals exemplify this trend. Amazon this week opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, part of its massive AI supercluster called Project Rainier, and said it would spend $5 billion on data centers in South Korea. Microsoft recently joined a consortium of investors to buy 50 data centers in the US and Latin America for $40 billion. Even Apple, a notoriously restrained spender compared to the other hyperscalers, told investors that it expects capex spending to increase in the next fiscal year. Investors are watching closely: companies showing early AI payoffs, like Google, are being rewarded, while others — like Meta — are running out of time to prove the spending spree is worth it. "After all the expensive hires and the capex ramp, Meta's grace period for showing investors something on the non-core AI side is nearly up," Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik said Wednesday in a research note. The question for investors: which of these giants can turn that spending into actual AI returns — and which are just building costlier foundations for the future? Capital expenditures in the company's most recent fiscal quarter were driven by growing demand for cloud and AI offerings, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The nearly $35 billion in spending represents a 74% increase from the same time period last year. Roughly half of that spend went primarily to GPUs and CPUs, which Hood referred to as "short-lived assets." Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leasing alone for the quarter. The company previously forecasted $30 billion in capex for the quarter. Amazon spent $34.2 billion in capex in the third quarter. The world's largest cloud provider said it expects to spend $125 billion this year in capex, up significantly from $83 billion in 2024. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend even more on capex in 2026 as it looks to double its data center capacity in the next two years. Meta spent $19.4 billion on capex in the third quarter, and is projecting 'notably higher growth' next year. Meta also adjusted its capex guidance range for 2025 from $70 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous estimate of $66 billion to $72 billion last quarter. That's almost double the amount — $39.2 billion total — Meta spent on capex in 2024. "We're seeing very high demand for additional compute," CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. The company expects to spend $116 billion to $118 billion on infrastructure costs next year, representing a 22% to 24% increase from 2025. Meta is building its own data centers and contracting space through third parties. It recently raised $29 billion for its massive data center project in Louisiana from firms including Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company's earnings call Wednesday that the "vast majority" of capex was spent on AI infrastructure. Approximately 60% of the spend went to chips and servers, while 40% went to networking equipment and data centers. Google raised its capex guidance for the year, projecting a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, up from its previous estimate of $85 billion. "We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're seeing from cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company," Ashkenazi said. Google parent Alphabet's stock jumped yesterday after it reported a boost in revenue growth from its cloud division in the third quarter. Wall Street seemed less concerned about its parent company's capex raise compared to those of its Big Tech peers. The third quarter was a "pretty solid flex" for Google, "around the AI bull case," Barclays analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. Jump to

Title: DeFi set for $2tn tokenisation boom: Standard Chartered picks the winners

About us Copy link DeFi is set for a $2 trillion boom. That’s according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at UK bank Standard Chartered, who expects Wall Street’s surging adoption of blockchain technology will drive the tokenised real-world asset market to increase by over 5,600% by 2028. That number is excluding the stablecoin market, which has ballooned to be worth just under $308 billion in 2025, fuelled by a friendlier US government. “Stablecoins are creating a platform for DeFi to continue its expansion in the coming years,” Kendrick wrote. “Their success in 2025 has raised awareness in developed markets and created the necessary liquidity onchain to enable other DeFi solutions.” He predicted that tokenised money-market funds powered by stablecoins will make up $750 billion of the $2 trillion market. The rest of the market will be made up of $750 billion in tokenised equities, and $250 billion in tokenised funds, Kendrick said. “The less liquid segments of private equity, commodities, corporate debt and real estate for the other $250 billion,” he added. The comments highlight the bullishness around tokenised assets from traditional finance. BlackRock, State Street and Deutsche Bank are just some of the financial giants muscling into this space. Kendrick said the DeFi boom is driven by three factors: surging awareness in developed markets, onchain liquidity, and the expansion of onchain lending. Ethereum has and “key DeFi protocols like Aave are going to be the winners,” Kendrick said. Indeed, Aave, DeFi’s largest lending platform, recently relaunched its institutional platform to capitalise on Wall Street’s growing interest. Earlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation rolled out a new institutional platform titled Ethereum for Institutions, a site designed to guide traditional financial institutions in integrating Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” the foundation said in its announcement. The US government’s drive to regulate the crypto market and to police the industry less strictly than during the Biden years has fuelled the rally. It has seen pro-crypto people be appointed to key government roles, seen a landmark stablecoin bill be signed into law, and Congress seems to be on the cusp of finalising a broad markets bill. To be sure, Kendrick warns that next year presents a massive danger that risks puncturing the growth. “The main risk to this would be if regulatory clarity in the US does not materialise — a possibility if the US administration is unable to push through regulatory changes before the November 2026 midterm elections, but not our base case,” he said.

Title: Meet the ex-McKinsey exec helping NYC's CEOs get comfortable with Zohran Mamdani

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yasser Salem is not the sort of guy you'd expect to drop everything to get a socialist elected. When we met, he wore a white button-down, a tweed sport coat, and a baseball cap with a camouflage American flag on it that said "Husband, Daddy, Protector, Hero." There's no irony in his choice of hat. A McKinsey and Saudi Public Investment Fund alum who ran his own investment firm, the 43-year-old father of five is a fan of Ayn Rand and her brand of free-market individualism. Salem is now selling Zohran Mamdani's democratic socialist vision in New York City's boardrooms. In September, he launched OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC that's raised nearly $400,000 from donors like Andrew Milgram, CEO of Marblegate Asset Management. While the PAC has spent money on ads — including $53,000 on a TV spot — Salem said its true goal is to act as a connective tissue between New York's business world and a populist candidate whose ascension is one of the year's top political stories. Salem's outreach follows months of condemnations of the candidate by Wall Street's elites like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Pershing Square head Bill Ackman, and Third Point hedge fund boss Dan Loeb. Billionaire corporate leaders have been spending big in a last-ditch effort to elect Andrew Cuomo. Since Mamdai's surprise 12-point primary win, Salem said, the business community has been more willing to engage with the candidate. Salem has chatted with more than 70 CEOs, roughly 30 of whom head large corporations, he said. Most conversations have been with the finance, insurance, and real estate industries, but about a third have been with tech CEOs, he said. Ralph Schlosstein, the Democrat chairman emeritus of Evercore and a cofounder of BlackRock, described OneNYC to Business Insider as "a noble effort to bridge the gap" between Mamdani, who is not well known to business leaders, and "those in the business community who are passionate about the success of the city." For his part, it has been reported that Mamdani has been on a charm offensive, meeting with tech executives and New York power brokers, including Dimon and Brooklyn developer Jed Walentas. Mamdani is listening to his critics, Salem said. He announced last week that he would keep on NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, to the chagrin of his most progressive supporters. This came after a "resounding, resounding recommendation" from business leaders, Salem said. Under rules governing PACs, Salem and OneNYC are not allowed to directly coordinate with the candidate, but he believes that there are more opportunities for partnership ahead. OneNYC is organizing a New York business advisory council that would be willing to advise a potential Mamdani administration, including Milgram and Kevin Ryan, a prolific venture investor of AlleyCorp who helped found Business Insider. Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, told Business Insider in an email that Salem is "building the infrastructure" to give business leaders "seats at the table" if Mamdani wins. She said that her nonprofit group, which represents the interests of some of the city's biggest corporations, has connected Salem with "individual leaders to hear their ideas and concerns." If the polls are correct, Salem says CEOs they've invited have "indicated that they're ready to join immediately after the election." Salem, a son of Egyptian immigrants who was raised in Manhattan, said the idea for the PAC came the night of Mamdani's primary landslide, while he was celebrating at the campaign's official watch party. He thought that if an NYU Stern and Harvard Business School graduate could join a bunch of progressive activists, maybe he could find some common ground between New York's business leaders and a Mamdani mayoralty. It was an unlikely revelation for someone whose résumé is packed with corporate strategy experience, not political organization. After a few banking internships, Salem's career took off with consulting powerhouse McKinsey, where he said he helped build infrastructure for the Saudi kingdom's response to the MERS virus in 2014. He also spent a year with Saudi Arabia's nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. When Mamdani announced his run in late 2024, Salem was running Hira Ventures, his own small private advisory and investment firm, which built a Brooklyn-based urgent care clinic and a COVID-testing business during the pandemic. As he grew his businesses, he also expanded his network of New York's business and political power players. When Salem first got a call late last year to meet Mamdani through a politically connected friend, he turned it down, he said. He was "in the middle of a deal, very busy." He also saw Mamdani polling at 1% and thought Mamdani "either doesn't know what he's saying isn't achievable, which is a problem, or he knows what he's saying isn't achievable, and that's even a bigger problem." As Mamdani's poll numbers and Instagram followers continued to rise, Salem decided he was judging the campaign like a consultant — expecting a five-year plan with milestones and metrics. But Mamdani wasn't offering a step-by-step blueprint; he was setting a vision. By laying out big goals, such as "an affordable New York for all," Salem said, Mamdani could be creating the energy and momentum to make change possible. When Salem set up OneNYC, he saw a way to get business leaders to "disregard distracting noise," and set out to use his experience. "When you're a seven-year vet at McKinsey, your day-to-day is to talk to CEOs, right?" Salem said. Mamdani's platform — free city buses, a rent freeze, and higher taxes on millionaires — has rattled New York's business elite. Executives warn his tax plan could drive wealth and jobs out of the city, while real-estate leaders say a rent freeze would squeeze landlords and stall repairs. At an event on Wednesday, Home Depot cofounder Ken Langone said: "New York is on the verge of making a monumental mistake." Andrew Milgram, the Marblegate founder who donated $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC before the primary and $50,000 to OneNYC when it launched, was convinced to support Mamdani because of the way his affordability message resonated with New Yorkers, calling him the "messenger of the moment." Milgram said it's obvious Salem "starts with a pretty tall order," but agreed that the idea "that we can generate real change in this city for the benefit of all" has some business leaders willing to think outside the box. Mamdani's loudest critics have threatened that if he wins, the city's tax base will flee. A poll from Victory Insights, a right-leaning polling firm, reported that more than a quarter of New York City residents would consider leaving if Mamdani won. Salem doesn't think that will be the case. "Early on, I heard almost zero about taxes, which I found fascinating," Salem said about his conversations with CEOs. Schlosstein said that many of his peers would be willing to pay more if they felt the difference in quality of life. "A good number of those who are higher income are prepared to pay somewhat higher taxes in order to have a more successful city," Schlosstein said. Salem said that CEOs have highlighted three major concerns: Mamdani's lack of experience, public safety plans, and fears that his housing affordability program would backfire. Salem explained that a potential Tisch appointment showcases that Mamdani will put "capability" over "ideology," helping allay concerns around his lack of experience or his plans for public safety. Some proposals, like free childcare, were easy for business leaders to understand. Others, like free buses, have required his background in advising to help people grasp the idea. Buses were selected because eliminating fares could also speed them up by cutting boarding time. Salem often cites a study by Charles Komanoff, the policy architect of New York's congestion pricing laws, which found that free buses would run 12% faster, cost just $600 million in lost fares, and bring nearly $1.5 billion in economic benefits. Salem says he hasn't embraced socialism but has shed a "purist approach" to capitalism over the last five years, partially driven by price-gouging among his competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He tries to get CEOs to see beyond labels and focus on practical differences. "It's like, guys, I am a big fan of Ayn Rand, I've read all of her work," he said. "We have a problem with labels. My position is that as business leaders, you have the added responsibility of distinguishing between labels and the actual meaning of the words." Correction: October 31, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated that Saudi Arabia's PIF was the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Jump to

Title: S&P 500’s path to 7,000 boosted by derivative flows

Time Published: 2025-10-31T04:30:25Z

A wave of bullish options trading has turbocharged the U.S. stock market’s rally, propelling the S&P 500 close to the 7,000 mark after gaining 17% so far this year. Traders have shown strong appetite for call options, pushing the one-month rolling calls-to-puts ratio to its most optimistic level in nearly four years. This surge in demand highlights the growing confidence among investors betting on continued market strength. (Source: Reuters) The sharp rise in call-option buying has left options dealers in a “short gamma” position, where they tend to amplify market swings rather than absorb them. In this setup, dealers sell stock futures when markets decline and buy them when prices rise, inadvertently increasing volatility. This dynamic means price moves in either direction are likely to become more pronounced. If the S&P 500 breaks above the key 7,000 level, dealers’ hedging activity could actually accelerate the rally. Since they are short gamma, dealers would be forced to buy stock futures to rebalance their positions as prices rise, adding fresh upward pressure. As Chris Murphy of Susquehanna Financial Group noted, the influx of aggressive upside call buyers has created conditions that could temporarily keep the market’s momentum alive. However, the same mechanics that drive rallies can also deepen declines. If the market starts to weaken, dealers could sell stock futures to hedge, worsening any pullback. Analysts caution that investors may have already priced in too much optimism, leaving little “fuel” for another big leg higher. SpotGamma’s Brent Kochuba believes the market could easily pause or retrace some gains from current levels. Much of the recent enthusiasm has been centred around the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. But according to Nomura’s Charlie McElligott, this rush into upside calls may have peaked. He expects a short-term pullback of 3% to 5% in major U.S. indexes, citing investor fatigue, rising concerns over AI spending, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate cuts.(Disclaimer: This slideshow has been sourced from Reuters.)

There is no question that we in the U.S, have turned a big corner when it comes to how and where we shop. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can turn it on (that is, if it is ever turned off) and traverse the shelves of millions of companies' merchandise, shopping the world without moving an inch. Contrast that with pre-digital days when families had a Sears, Roebuck or a Montgomery Wards catalogue and thumbed through them, routinely, to see all the marvelous gimcrack that money could buy. To put things in perspective, Montgomery Ward, the company that actually invented the mail-order catalog in 1872, ended publication of its general catalogue in 1985 due to financial difficulties and competition from modern retail formats. Sears ceased publication of its full-line catalogue in 1993. I remember both, fondly. They were "dream books" where all manner of fascinating (and many ordinary) items called out from their silent placement on one of hundreds of pages to ordinary Americans to please consider them for purchase. These books were thought to be in direct competition with local merchants, but few or no local shop owners had the space or financial wherewithall to stock them. Both Sears and Wards opened their stores at roughly the same time (Sears in 1925 and Wards in 1926). Their popularity grew quickly, but both maintained strong original customer bases among rural Americans. For the next fifty years or so, Americans displayed pretty predictable buying habits. Then, in the late eighties, the spread of the computer began to alter those habits. Online merchandisers started appearing, the most prominent of course is the ubiquitous Amazon which made its debut in 1995 (in 1994 it was called "Cadabra"). The shopping paradigm took a massive jolt as the company went from strength to strength during the 1990s. From a startup selling books, music and videos, the company soon changed its business model to that of a multi-sided marketplace platform (MSMP) which now connects sellers (who list and sell products), buyers (who shop through Amazon’s site or app) and third-party service providers (delivery, advertising, developers, etc.). The company actually took the Sears/Wards concept and ratcheted it up and applied it to the modern marketplace thanks to digitalization. Today, Amazon earns money by facilitating transactions between these three sides of itself and taking a cut through commissions, fees, and services. In some ways, Amazon resembles Sears and Wards and all other previous merchants. It buys wholesale and sells retail. Unlike its bricks and mortar predecessors, though, it engages in third-party marketplace sales by using its digital platform to reach customers, and it takes a referral fee (usually 8%–15%) and sometimes fulfillment and storage fees (FBA) from the companies whose products are listed. The company has a Web Services Division (AWS) which is a cloud-based computing division launched in 2006. It provides servers, storage, databases, and AI tools to businesses, globally. (This division is Amazon's most profitable one.) Then there is Amazon's subscription services which include Amazon Prime (membership for free shipping, video streaming, music, etc.) which generates recurring revenue and strengthens customer loyalty. Another revenue stream for Amazon is its sale of ad space on its website and applications. (Sponsored product listings, banner ads, and video ads now make Amazon the third-largest digital ad company after Google and Meta). Amazon and its founder learned much from Sears and Wards. Both older companies offered ancillary services like: insurance, credit and financing, automotive and home services and mail-order repair and service. It is fair to say that both of them were trusted by American consumers. Their guarantees were honored and their service was sterling. Amazon's return policy is seamless and trusted by millions of customers who know that they will be treated fairly by the company if a product doesn't live up to its claims. In pre-Amazon days, local merchants lived and died by their reputations. If customers lost faith in or were treated poorly by local merchants they stopped patronizing them and their businesses failed. Amazon sits on the same slippery slope and knows that its reputation is built one sale and sometimes one return at a time which is why it has adopted policies similar to those of Sears and Wards. There is a reputational value for many companies to have their products listed with Amazon because they know that they will not have to stand at the front line and defend their own individual return policies. Amazon will do it for them, and if Amazon treats its customers well, it reflects positively on manufacturers who don't have to deal with dissatisfied customers if something goes wrong. That is a double-edged sword, however, as Amazon gets all the credit for the successful consummation of the sale and the after-sale experience. In essence, individual companies cede their reputations to Amazon's sales fulfillment policy. Granted that a bad product is still a bad product, and the original manufacturer will still have to defend it, but the whole return experience rests in Amazon's hands. This singular return policy issue is often a deal-breaker or deal-maker for American consumers. Trust is key and so is ease of return. Other online retailers know this and are keenly aware that it is not only the products that compete with each other but sales, return and service policies as well and they can often make the difference between a sale or a miss. Websites went mainstream in the mid-to-late 1990s, but it wasn't until around the new millenium at the beginning of the dot com era that the bulk of retailers discovered the benefits of a web presence. Our buying culture began to change as more and more Americans began to go "online" and dip their toes in the digital retailers' water. Twenty-five years ago there were $25 billion in retail online sales. Today, global retail sales are $6.3 trillion. By comparison, Sears' highest annual sales year was in 2003 with $53 billion. Amazon's net sales in the same year were $5.26 billion. How are American consumers shopping today? If we look at "traditional" non-digital bricks and mortar retail sales in the U.S. today, the figure is estimated to be about $7.26 trillion. U.S. online (digital) retail sales in 2024 are estimated at about $1.19 trillion. While the actual sales figure disparity is huge, there is one very worrisome trend that keeps physical retailers up at night. It is "showrooming." Showrooming is simply a situation where a potential customer will visit a physical store, view an actual product on display, note its price and then take up a salesperson's time with a number of questions, after which they will leave and do an Internet search (probably on Amazon) and make their purchase based on price. Obviously, this disadvantages the physical retailer that has to inventory the product, display the product, educate his workforce on the merits of the product, and then worry that the customer will change his mind after purchasing it and return it at which point the retailer must then incorporate it back into his stock as a "used product" and take a loss on its sale. Meanwhile, Amazon has dedicated online retail marketplaces with websites in about 23 countries. There are eleven in Europe and the U.K. but none in Denmark, for example, to take just one Scandinavian country. One might ask why that is. Apart from the obvious market size (Denmark has only 6 million people) there are other reasons, one of them being the labor issue. Denmark follows what’s called the Danish model, a system based on collective bargaining between unions and employer organizations, rather than strict labor laws set by the state. Around 65%–70% of Danish workers are union members, and unions are deeply involved in setting working conditions, wages, and benefits. Employers operating in Denmark are expected — almost socially and politically required — to recognize and negotiate with unions. Amazon’s stance on unions is one of resistance to unionization. The company prefers direct employee management rather than collective bargaining and has fought union access in many countries (including Germany, the U.S., and the UK). In countries where unions are especially strong — like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden — Amazon’s reluctance to engage with unions has created tension in what can only be described as the "Nordic labor conflict." In 2023 in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Transportarbetareförbundet) and Union launched strikes at Amazon’s Swedish logistics partners because Amazon refused to sign a collective agreement. Danish unions, including 3F (Fagligt Fælles Forbund), HK Handel, and others, supported the Swedish strike, refusing to handle Amazon goods from Sweden. This Nordic solidarity action effectively made it impossible for Amazon to operate freely in Denmark without recognizing a union agreement. As of today, Amazon still has no collective bargaining agreement in Scandinavia, though negotiations have been discussed. The practical effect on Denmark is that Amazon has avoided opening warehouses, logistics hubs, or data centers in Denmark as doing so would legally and socially require negotiating with unions. Instead, the company serves Danish customers through Germany, where it can maintain control of operations while still reaching the Danish market. This has given cover to Danish retailers who are still able to avoid in-country Amazon competition and continue to charge high prices for many of the same goods. However, if Danish consumers wish to purchase goods through Amazon's marketplaces in E.U. countries they can avoid paying customs duties or tariffs as the purchases are considered intra-E.U. sales and not international imports. Danish customers will still pay the onerous 25% Value Added Tax on products shipped to Denmark through the EU VAT One Stop Shop (OSS) System. The future for physical retailers is one of adapt or fail as the Internet and AI join forces to find the best deals across many digital platforms and place further pressure on traditional merchants that have avoided changing their business models. This goes for stores in Denmark that must shell out vast sums for store rentals and high wages for employees and for "showroomers" where steadily rising costs challenge their bottom lines.

Title: Meta could get left behind in the AI arms race—and the stock is paying for it

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have his head in the clouds—and that might be the problem. Shares in the Facebook parent are getting crushed Thursday after it unveiled a mixed set of third-quarter earnings last night and doubled down on plans to billions more on artificial intelligence over the coming year. “Our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully," finance chief Susan Li told investors late Wednesday. “We expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. As a result, our current expectation is that Capex dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025." Those remarks overshadowed both a record quarterly revenue tally of $51.2 billion and a $16 billion tax hit that ate into the group’s bottom line. “Meta has always been a company willing to spend its way into the future," said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank. “This quarter confirms that pattern, only now the bet is far larger and the payoff less immediate." Meta’s challenge, however, is that it can’t finance its AI ambitions through cash flows in the way that rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which have massive commercial cloud computing divisions that generate billions in revenue, are able to do. And that leads to more debt. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Meta is planning to raise $25 billion through a six-part corporate bond offering that will include debt that doesn’t mature until the year 2065. A deal Meta finished last week, aimed at building a new data center in Louisiana, also moved $27 billion in debt from its balance sheet by structuring it through a special-purpose vehicle. Zuckerberg hinted at the idea of selling some of its excess computing power to outside customers if the group “overshoots" on its spending and infrastructure plans. “And then you know, the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation," he said. “But we’d grow into that and use it over time." A lot can change in that waiting period, however, especially given that Meta remains caught in the inherent contradiction of AI itself: If the technology is successful in speeding up tasks and accelerating online efficiencies, users will likely then spend less time on the ad-based platforms such as Facebook and Instagram that drive nearly all of the group’s profits. It’s also worth noting that the Metaverse, Zuckerberg’s last great tech vision that was launched with great fanfare in late 2020, has been something of a dud. Reality Labs, the division created to power that alternative universe, lost $4.4 billion last quarter, taking its cumulative red ink past $70 billion in less than five years. Bank of America analyst Justin Post, however, remains a believer. “We expect Meta stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and free cash flow pressure in 2026," he said in a note published Thursday. “However, we see Meta in a position of strength with massive user network and opportunity to integration compelling AI products (including content creation tools) over the next two years." Still, Post lowered his Meta stock price target by $90, taking it to $810 a share, although he kept his Buy rating in place. Meta stock was down 9.6% at 679.73, a move that would mark the biggest single-day since April 2024. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Gold vs Ondo vs ConstructKoin: Which RWAs will dominate 2025 and beyond?

Tokenization is surging as analysts predict significant capital inflows, offering enticing prospects for retail and institutional investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Disclosure: This is a paid article. Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. Learn more › It’s no secret that one of the hottest tickets in crypto right now is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The market grew from $15.7 billion in January to over $35.5 billion today, making gains during the current bull run and consolidating even when other areas of the market looked weak. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that savvy traders are eyeing the market with a view to profit-making opportunities, seeking the best investments as the year closes out. Whether in finance, commodities, or real estate, there are a number of potential RWAs which merit closer scrutiny. Here we take a look at which real-world assets could lead the pack through 2025 and beyond. Tokenization is on a growing adoption curve as analysts predict capital inflows from retail and institutional investors alike. For anyone seeking to ride the crest of this liquidity wave, there are a number of options worthy of further scrutiny. ConstructKoin (CTK) – ConstructKoin is a newcomer to the field already garnering significant coverage in the trades. Currently in pre-sale on Ethereum, ConstructKoin focuses on property development empowering investors to “become the bank” and earn a yield of between 7-15% through ownership of $CTK tokens. ConstructKoin is currently generating buzz thanks to its loan book funding model which is powered by next-level AI and building information management software. Lending decisions are made in hours rather than weeks, promising accelerated property development with rapid growth potential. Gold (XAUt, PAXG, etc.) – It’s been a great year for gold, soaring against fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound and Euro. Gold began the year at just $2,600 per ounce and now rests just shy of $4,000, offering significant upside for anyone with exposure. Thanks to gold’s popularity as an investment commodity, a number of players including Tether (XAUt) and Paxos (PAXG) offer tokenized gold among their portfolio of stablecoins. On October 17, gold prices peaked at an all-time high of over $4,300 before buy momentum eased and charts retraced. The question investors will ask now is whether 2025’s gold rush has finally run out of speed. Ondo Finance (ONDO) – Ondo is one of RWA’s frontrunners, offering tokenized US treasuries and bank demand deposits. From its launch in 2024 to today ONDO has made significant progress, rising from a price of just $0.16 to $0.69. CoinCodex shows the ONDO token is up 330% from inception and now boasts a market capitalization of over $2B. In March of this year ONDO moved $95 million into BlackRock’s tokenized asset fund BUIDL signaling greater institutional involvement in the tokenization sphere, and further bolstering proponents’ claims Ondo is ‘the Blackrock of crypto.’ From the start of 2025 the total volume locked (TVL) in Ondo Finance rose from $612 million to $1.78 billion, suggesting strong fundamentals and sustained interest. While market predictions are a tricky business, global consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group predicts the RWA market will touch $16 trillion by 2030. Expectations vary however. More conservative projections by McKinsey and Citi Group predict the market will reach $4 trillion, while Standard Chartered projects the market will soar to $30 trillion over the same period. Though analysts may quibble on the exact numbers, all agree the upward momentum of the sector is parabolic. The forecasts for tokenization look strong but for investors speculating on which asset class will perform best through the remainder of 2025, a number of key factors will come into play. Gold has performed extremely well this year, boosted by the ongoing US-China trade war, but may already have peaked. Although gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, this only applies in periods of highest uncertainty. Unless there are major surprises in store for global trade relations, the best days for goldbugs may already have passed. In the medium term, Ondo Finance looks strong. Key partnerships with TradFi’s heavy hitters such as BlackRock place Ondo on a strong footing, and its growing TVL suggest ONDO token may be underpriced. ConstructKoin ($CTK) stands out as a project offering double-digit yields and exposure to the real estate sector. Its design connects digital assets with a traditionally stable market, making it one to watch closely as the project develops through 2025 and beyond. Disclaimer: This was a sponsored (paid) post.

Title: Integrating event information and multi dimensional relationships for improved financial time series forecasting
URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22926-y
Time Published: 2025-10-31T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value.

Title: Has Mastercard accepted the inevitability of crypto? Spends $2B on tokenization platform

Mastercard’s rumored deal for Zero Hash marks the moment stablecoin settlement leaves the sandbox and enters the payments mainstream. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Mastercard may soon make a significant investment to fully enter the crypto space. According to Reuters, the company is in advanced talks to acquire Zero Hash for roughly $1.5 to $2 billion, a move that, if completed, would fold a regulated crypto-settlement network into one of the world’s largest payment processors. On the surface, it looks like another corporate experiment with digital assets. Underneath, it’s something bigger: an attempt to rebuild the plumbing of money itself around stablecoins, not banks. Zero Hash isn’t a consumer-facing brand but the quiet infrastructure behind several tokenization efforts. Founded in 2017, it’s regulated as a money transmitter across the US, holds a New York BitLicense, and operates under equivalent virtual-asset frameworks in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The firm already processes flows for issuers such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Republic, enabling their tokenized funds to move value across twenty-two chains and seven major stablecoins. Earlier this year, it raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation, led by Interactive Brokers, with backing from Morgan Stanley, Apollo, and SoFi. This demonstrates that traditional finance is treating on-chain settlement less like a curiosity and more like a utility. For Mastercard, the attraction is obvious. Its network moves trillions each year but remains tethered to the old calendar of money: weekday clearing, T+1 or T+2 settlement, closed on weekends. Zero Hash runs twenty-four hours a day. Owning it would enable Mastercard to settle card and account-to-account payments in regulated stablecoins, compressing those delays to T+0 while keeping everything within its compliance perimeter. The company has hinted at this direction before, with its “wallets-to-checkouts” stablecoin pilot launched in April 2025, but that was still a sandbox. A purchase would turn it into infrastructure. The timing couldn’t be better. Stablecoins now total more than $300 billion in circulation, with monthly on-chain settlements of around $1.25 trillion, according to a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 report. Most of that volume still flows between exchanges and DeFi protocols; however, a rising share comes from cross-border payouts and fintech wallets, the very niches where card networks have struggled to maintain high margins. Visa has already partnered with Allium to publish stablecoin analytics, Stripe quietly re-enabled USDC settlements, and PayPal is running its own token. Mastercard risks disintermediation unless it controls a comparable rail of its own. Zero Hash also sits at the intersection of two fast-growing markets: stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Much of the $35 billion now locked in on-chain real-world-asset products, mainly short-term T-bills backing stablecoins, moves through entities like it. That gives Mastercard an entry point not only into consumer payments but also into institutional treasury flows, a part of the market where instant, programmable settlement could replace the slower web of correspondent banks and clearinghouses. The overlap of these two systems, consumer payouts and institutional liquidity, may explain why Mastercard is willing to pay roughly twice Zero Hash’s last valuation. If the deal closes, it would mark the first time a tier-one card network owns a fully regulated stablecoin processor outright. The broader context is a quiet arms race. Visa, Stripe, and even Coinbase are investing in fiat-to-stablecoin bridges to capture future settlement fees. Each knows that whoever runs the compliant, always-on layer between bank accounts and blockchains will effectively own the next generation of payments. Mastercard’s move reframes that race: rather than experiment on the side, it is pulling the rails in-house. There are hurdles. Zero Hash’s licenses will require change-of-control approvals from state regulators, the NYDFS, and European authorities under MiCA. Those sign-offs could take months. And while the US Senate’s stablecoin bill passed earlier this year, it still awaits full enactment. Yet the direction of policy is clear. Both the US and EU frameworks now treat fiat-backed stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, establishing reserve and disclosure standards that institutional users can accept. That clarity lowers the reputational risk for Mastercard to integrate them directly. The economics are enticing. Even a sliver of global stablecoin flow could generate material revenue if monetized like a network. A 0.75% share of the $12 trillion annualized stablecoin volume would give Mastercard roughly $90 billion of addressable settlement activity. At a blended take-rate of 12-20 basis points, that’s $100 to $180 million in potential yearly revenue, small next to its $25 billion top line but growing far faster than card transactions. And unlike interchange, those fees accrue around data, compliance, and liquidity, not consumer spending. The bigger prize is strategic. As more money lives on-chain, card networks must decide whether to compete with or become the settlement layer. Mastercard appears to have made its choice. Zero Hash offers not just APIs and licenses but a template for how traditional payment giants might survive the shift: by absorbing the crypto infrastructure before it absorbs them.

Apple is on a record-setting streak. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up more than 3% in extended trading Thursday, topping their recent highs after the iPhone maker posted earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates and CEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook for the holiday season. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $102.47 billion. Both figures came in ahead of analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as Apple's services revenue climbed to a record high of $28.75 billion. Growth in Apple's iPhone sales also helped drive the better-than-expected results, after the company launched its iPhone 17 lineup in September. Sales of iPhones rose 6% to $49.03 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing the bulk of Apple's product revenue. The figure also represented a September quarter revenue record for the iPhone, with CEO Tim Cook suggesting that could mean a record holiday season ahead. "We expect December-quarter revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone," Cook said on the company's earnings call Thursday, anticipating 10% to 12% revenue growth. Analysts were looking for 6%. Apple shares were up about 8% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, making it the word's second-most-valuable company behind only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).

Full Content:
Apple (AAPL) is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street analysts looking for strong results on the top and bottom lines. After some signs of a strong start to early sales of the iPhone 17 lineup, bullish analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley recently told clients their expectations around Apple's results have climbed, with that momentum likely to carry into an upbeat outlook for the current quarter and winter holiday season. More details around widely anticipated artificial intelligence features and potential plans for a foldable phone in 2026 could also drive more enthusiasm for Apple's stock, they said. Options pricing suggests traders expect Apple stock could move about 3% in either direction by the end of this week following the company's earnings call, which could drive the stock to a new record. This hasn't been an easy year for Apple, amid lingering concerns that its AI efforts have lagged those of many of its Big Tech peers. However, strong results today and comments around plans for fiscal 2026 could help lift investor sentiment. Apple shares have climbed about 8% in 2025 so far, lagging the S&P 500's nearly 17% gain, after spending some of the year in negative territory amid worries about its AI progress. Apple's gains have largely come in the last few months, after some signs of inroads with the Trump administration and easing trade policy headwinds, along with promising demand signals for the iPhone 17. The iPhone maker is seen reporting earnings of $1.77 per share on revenue of $101.61 billion, up from earnings per share of 97 cents on $94.93 billion in revenue a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. However, analysts are divided on whether the iPhone's stock still has room to rise from this week's all-time highs. The shares were up about 1% near $272 in recent trading, leaving it on track to close at a fresh high topping yesterday's record. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) on the list of the world's most valuable companies.

October 30, 2025 13:30 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino THIRD-QUARTER 2025 Continuation of the first half-year's growth dynamic Growth in net sales: +0.5% LFL in Q3 and +0.6% over the first nine months The initial results of the “Renouveau” plan are confirmed, and the Group is again reporting like-for-like net sales growth this quarter. Increase in cumulative adjusted EBITDA1 at end-September: +13% Cost cutting and the bulk of the work already carried out on streamlining the store network enabled the Group to increase its adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of the year: Compliance with the covenant and slight upturn in cash flow Improved free cash flow before financial expenses: -€39m at end-September 2025 (-€48m at end-June), underpinned by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. The Group reiterates that the basis of comparison was adversely affected by the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash flow amounted to -€198 million. The Group's liquidity1 stood at €1.22bn at 30 September 2025. Covenant requirements were satisfied, with a “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio of 7.68x at end-September 2025, below the threshold of 8.34x. The Group is maintaining its objective of returning to break-even free cash flow before financial expenses in 2026 and confirms the financial objectives set out in its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan. SALES AND ADJUSTED EBITDA In Q3 2025, net sales amounted to €2,002m, up +0.5% on a like-for-like basis, with convenience brands up +1.1% in Q3. After taking into account a -0.2-pt calendar effect and the roughly -3.5 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, Q3 sales were down -3.2%. Over the first nine months of 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €6,080m, up +0.6% like-for-like, with convenience brands up +1.1%. After considering a -0.6-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the roughly -2.9 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, total sales for the first nine months were down -2.9%. Group adjusted EBITDA stood at €456m (+13%) over the first nine months of 2025, lifting the margin to 7.5% (+106 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €112m (vs. €59m over the first nine months of 2024). Monoprix Growth was driven by food sales (+0.9%), once again underpinned by a good performance in fresh products (+2.1%), particularly fruit and vegetables, which continued to benefit from marketing initiatives including the price repositioning initiated in H1 2025. Non-food sales were stable this quarter, as the Fashion & Home segment continued to outperform the market. Monoprix also continued to develop its "La Cantine" food concept, launched in April, with the roll-out of 3 additional stores in Paris and the Paris region, bringing the number of stores converted to the new concept by end-September to 6, with the aim of extending the concept to around 10 stores by the end of the year. Over the quarter, the streamlining of the store network resulted in the closure of 3 stores and the transfer of 3 owned stores to franchises at Monoprix (16 closures and 3 transfers since the beginning of the year). The brand also opened 8 new outlets during the quarter (19 since the beginning of the year). Franprix The positive impact of the "prix francs” (fair prices) campaign, with price cuts and price freezes on 50 private-label products, and the good performance of stores converted to the "Oxygène" concept, helped to support this trend over the quarter. The concept was extended to a further 25 stores over the quarter, bringing the total number of stores converted to the new concept to 75 at end-September, outperforming the rest of the store network (like-for-like sales growth of +2.3% over the quarter vs. -0.2% for the store network as a whole). Franprix continued to expand its quick meal solutions offer at end-September with the roll-out of two low-cost meal deals (breakfast and lunch).Changes within the Franprix network continued during the quarter with 24 store closures, 5 openings (64 closures, 22 openings and 6 transfers of owned stores to franchises or business leases since the beginning of the year). Casino/Spar/Vival This performance was underpinned by strong momentum in July (+3.6%) and September (+2.0%), ahead of a +0.3% improvement in August. Seasonal stores once again supported the trend this quarter, with a good summer season in the mountains for the Spar and Sherpa stores. Over the quarter, the Casino, Spar and Vival owned stores recorded a -1.2% decline in customer traffic (compared with a -0.2% decline in Q2 and a -2.9% decline in Q1).The roll-out of the "Coeur de Blé" quick meal solutions concept continued with 22 new dedicated outlets opened this quarter (36 at end-September) and 26 more planned by the end of the year. The new Spar "Origines" concept, which saw its first store opening in Luynes (Bouches-du-Rhône) this summer, confirmed the net sales growth prospects. The brand plans to open 4 more new stores by the end of the year, and to accelerate roll-out in 2026.The store network saw 98 stores leave the network in Q3 2025, 37 store openings and 19 transfers from owned stores to franchises (866 exits, 101 openings and 67 transfers to franchises since the beginning of the year). Naturalia This performance was boosted by a good momentum in the organic market, amplified by the effectiveness of in-store initiatives and the ongoing success of the "La Ferme" concept, rolled out in 3 additional stores this quarter (23 stores rolled out at end-September). The momentum of e-commerce sales continued, with +27% growth for the brand’s website, while Naturalia continues to expand its quick commerce business with the expansion of its Uber Eats partnership to 9 new stores over the quarter (47 stores at end-September). The quick meal solutions offer further expanded its roll-out: 3 new stores switched to the organic snacking concept this quarter, bringing the number of stores in the test phase to 9. Naturalia closed 1 store and opened 1 store in Q3 2025 (12 closures, 1 opening and 1 transfer from an owned store to a business lease since the beginning of the year). Cdiscount Driven by the marketing reinvestment plan, brand awareness rose significantly and new customer acquisition accelerated (+41% in Q3 2025 after +37% in H1). Cdiscount net sales fell by -2.9% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting the priority given to profitability through the momentum of the Marketplace and the moderate decline in direct sales. Cdiscount Advertising's momentum (revenues up +7.8%) continued with the launch of a new Retail Media product, “Sponsored Brand Video”. Other and Quatrim OTHER FINANCIAL INDICATORS Free cash flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations Over the first nine months of 2025, free cash flow before financial expenses stood at -€39m (-€48m at end-June), driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. It therefore improved by +€500m compared with the first nine months of 2024 (-€539m) and by +€347m excluding the repayment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. Liquidity7 at 30 September 2025 At 30 September 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.22bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Covenants Net leverage ratio7 The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio stood at 7.68x, below the ratio requirement of 8.34x. The Group states that the EBITDA forecasts for Q4 2025 should ensure compliance with the next test, which will take place on 31 December 2025. HIGHLIGHTS Real estate disposals Quatrim and its subsidiaries disposed of €14m in real estate assets in Q3 2025. On 1 August, the Group repaid €20m of the secured debt carried by Quatrim, enabling reduction of the nominal value of this debt to €198m at 30 September 2025. Assaí procedure Since the press release dated 26 September 2025 concerning the request for provisional measures submitted by Sendas Distribuidora S.A. (see press release), Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Segisor (collectively "Casino") have had access to the file and Casino has presented its defence to the judge. The proceedings are in progress. Proceedings before the Paris Court Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was referred to the Paris Criminal Court following the preliminary investigation by the Financial Public Prosecutor (Parquet National Financier – PNF) for alleged stock price manipulation and private corruption dating back to 2018 and 2019. The hearing before the Paris Criminal Court took place from 1 to 22 October 2025. The Financial Public Prosecutor requested (i) that Casino Guichard Perrachon be ordered to pay a fine of €75m and (ii) that it be prohibited from making an offer to the public of securities and from having its securities admitted to trading on a regulated market for a period of three years, suspended in its entirety, and that it be subject to a compliance programme supervised by the French Anti-Corruption Agency (Agence Française Anticorruption – AFA). These requisitions do not constitute a court decision and the Financial Public Prosecutor's requests are not binding on the Court. Casino Guichard Perrachon contests the fact that it can be personally accused of an offence and asserts that it did not, in any way, benefit from the alleged events mentioned in this dispute. The Group points out that no provision has been recorded in its financial statements in this respect. Judgement is expected to be handed down on 29 January 2026. Franchising of 27 Monop’ stores The Group announces the franchising of 27 Monop’ stores in Paris and the Île-de-France region as part of the joint venture between Monoprix and the Zouari family (7 stores on 28 October, 11 on 29 October and 9 on 30 October). Refer to press release of 29 April 2025 APPENDICES – STORE NETWORK Store network of continuing operations BL: business lease APPENDICES – ACCOUNTING INFORMATION APPENDICES – GLOSSARY Like-for-like (LFL) growthLike-for-like net sales include e-commerce sales and sales of merchandise excluding fuel from stores open for at least 12 months. The figure is calculated at constant exchange rates, excluding calendar effects and tax. Gross merchandise volume (GMV)For convenience brands, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by all the owned and franchised stores and the e-commerce sites, including VAT. For Cdiscount, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by the Cdiscount group’s websites and by independent Marketplace vendors. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense included in trading profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales excluding taxes. Adjusted EBITDA after lease paymentsAdjusted EBITDA after lease payments is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation presented in trading profit less repayments of lease liabilities and net interest paid on lease liabilities. DissynergiesDissynergies on operating costs correspond to the loss of economies of scale previously achieved through the hypermarket and supermarket activities and those of the former Latin American subsidiaries (Exito and GPA), up until their disposal in 2024. These costs, initially presented in the 'Other' segment, have been reallocated to the Group entities concerned as from 1 January 2025, in line with the implementation of shared support services. Free cash flow before/after financial expenses Free cash flow before financial expenses corresponds to cash flow from operating activities as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, less net capex, rental payments subject to restatement in accordance with IFRS 16 and adjusted for the effects related to the strategic disposal plan and the financial restructuring.Free cash flow after financial expenses is calculated by deducting net interest paid from free cash flow before financial expenses, excluding interest on leases restated in accordance with IFRS 16. Covenant – Net leverage ratioThe covenant is defined as the ratio between "covenant net debt" and "covenant adjusted EBITDA". The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. Covenant adjusted EBITDA“Covenant adjusted EBITDA” or pro forma EBITDA (depending on the documentation) corresponds to adjusted EBITDA after lease payments relating to the covenant scope, excluding any impact of scope effects and pro forma restatements corresponding to future savings/synergies to be achieved within 18 months. LiquidityAccording to banking documentation, liquidity corresponds to consolidated cash and cash equivalents (less cash in transit and non-centralised cash), as well as undrawn and immediately available operating financing (excluding factoring, reverse factoring and similar programmes). Covenant net debt“Covenant net debt” corresponds to gross debt relating to the covenant scope (including borrowings from other Group companies by covenant companies), (i) plus financial liabilities which are, in essence, debt, (ii) adjusted for the average drawdown on the Group’s revolving credit lines over the last 12 months (from the date of restructuring) and (iii) reduced by cash and cash equivalents of the entities in the covenant scope and by non-deconsolidating receivables relating to operating financing programmes reinstated as part of the restructuring. It differs from consolidated “net debt”, which corresponds to all gross borrowings and debt at the reporting date, including derivatives designated as fair value hedges (liabilities) and trade payables - structured programme, less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii) derivatives designated as fair value hedges (assets), and (iv) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets.

Title: Amazon Is Set To Report Earnings Today. Here's What Investors Should Know
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-is-set-to-report-earnings-today-what-investors-should-know-11840316
Time Published: 2025-10-30T16:55:58Z
Full Content:
Amazon is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday, and all eyes are likely to be on the e-commerce giant’s cloud business. Amazon is expected to report third-quarter revenue of about $178 billion, a 12% increase from last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Its earnings are expected to increase 10% to $1.57 a share. While Amazon’s e-commerce operation makes up the bulk of its business, investors will be most focused on its AI efforts, represented by cloud revenue and capital expenditures. Amazon’s cloud growth of 17.5% in the second quarter exceeded official expectations, but disappointed Wall Street after two blowout reports from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). On Wednesday, both of those companies again posted cloud revenue well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, setting another high bar for Amazon to clear. Amazon's array of businesses spans e-commerce, logistics, advertising, cloud computing and more, making its results a partial reflection of the financial health of U.S. consumers and businesses. Its market capitalization—well over $2 trillion as of midday Thursday—makes its stock one of the most influential in the stock market. Investors may also be primed for Amazon to increase its capital expenditures guidance after Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META) did so with their reports Wednesday. Amazon’s second-quarter capex of $32.2 billion was about 25% higher than analysts expected. Wedbush analysts expect Amazon’s full-year capex to total $119 billion, implying growth of about 10% between the first and second halves of this year. “We are constructive on the setup leading into the report given positive commentary around [Amazon Web Services] growth, healthy trends for the core retail business, and strong advertiser demand,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a note late last week. Amazon stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven recently, with shares up just 3% since the start of the year. Concerns about tariffs and lagging cloud growth have weighed on the stock. Some investors see the potential for shares to close the gap with the rest of the Mag 7 after earnings. Options prices on Thursday morning suggest traders expect Amazon stock to move about 6.3% in either direction by end of the week. A move higher off of Wednesday’s closing price would put shares around $244.75, which would be their first all-time high since early February, while an equivalent decline would put the stock at about $216. Wall Street is generally bullish on the outlook for Amazon stock, with all 22 of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha assigning it a “Buy” rating. Their median price target of $270 is nearly 20% above the stock’s intraday price on Thursday. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect analysts’ estimates for Amazon's diluted earnings per share.

Title: Alphabet Stock Hits Record High After Google Parent Reports Strong Earnings—Monitor These Key Levels

Alphabet (GOOGL) shares jumped to a record high Thursday after the Google parent reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, as quarterly revenue surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The tech giant’s top line received a boost in the third quarter from Google Cloud posting a 34% jump in revenue from a year earlier, as Alphabet customers invest billions expanding their AI infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. Meanwhile, revenue in the company’s legacy advertising business grew 13% in the period, signaling that the digital ad market remains stable amid economic uncertainty and increasing competition. The company also raised its capital expenditure spending forecast for the year to between $91 billion to $93 billion, citing booming AI demand. Alphabet shares were up nearly 5% at around $288 in recent trading and have now gained more than 50% since the start of 2025, making it the top-performing Magnificent Seven-member stock this year, slightly ahead of AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Investors have cheered the company’s accelerating growth in AI and cloud, resilience in its advertising business, and an antitrust win that allowed it to retain its Chrome browser. Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Alphabet shares broke out from a flag pattern earlier this month, indicating a continuation of the stock’s strong uptrend. It’s worth pointing out that while the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, the indicator sits in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of near-term profit-taking or consolidation. Let’s use the measuring principle to forecast a potential upside target on Alphabet’s chart if the shares continue to rally and also identify two major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns. Investors can forecast a bullish upside target by applying the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes a stock's prior moves to project its next potential advance. When applying the study to Alphabet’s chart, we calculate the distance in points of the strong trend higher that preceded the flag and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $115 to $245, which forecasts a target of $360. During downturns, investors should initially monitor the $235 level. Traders who avoid chasing breakouts may wait for retracements to the base of the flag pattern, which also coincides with a wide-ranging day on the chart in early September. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares revisit lower support around $205. This area on the chart, currently situated just above the rising 50-week moving average, may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent January swing high.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous. Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has soared 13% in a week, driven by significant momentum in the AI sector. This surge is fueled by two major catalysts: Given this dramatic 13% increase, it is a fundamental part of a robust investment strategy to re-evaluate the stock’s position. Below is a comparison of Broadcom against its peers, focusing on key financial metrics such as size, valuation, growth, and margin. For some context, Broadcom delivers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Why does this matter? AVGO recently rose by 17% in a month – a peer comparison places stock performance, valuation, and financials in a broader context – indicating whether it is genuinely outperforming, lagging behind, and ultimately – can this trend continue? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to determine if Broadcom stands as a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally – observe how the stock has historically dipped and recovered through AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it." The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week. President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates. Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%.. More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models. Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

Title: OpenAI Reportedly Planning ‘Up to $1 Trillion’ IPO as Early as Next Year

Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes An anonymously sourced report from Reuters claims that OpenAI is planning an initial public offering that would value the AI colossus at “up to $1 trillion.” Just on Tuesday the company formally completed its slow evolution from an ambiguous non-profit to a for-profit company. Now it appears to be formalizing plans to become one of the world’s centers of economic powerâat least on paper.Â Â The $1 trillion report comes from “three people familiar with the matter.” Reuters’ sources claimed that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has been telling OpenAI “associates” that an IPO is coming in 2027, but that actually it could come in late 2026.Â Judging by the current ranking of companies by market capitalization, a $1 trillion valuation would make OpenAI the 12th most valuable publicly traded firm on Earth, just below Berkshire Hathaway, and just above JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.Â A publicly traded OpenAI would make for a fascinating case study, since shareholders really do expect companies to bring in money instead of just spending itâsomething OpenAI has notoriously had a hard time doing so far. As Elon Musk once put it, “There’s immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter.”Â Becoming public can force a lot of information about a company’s real value into public viewâquarterly and annual reports on finances most famously, but also everything about the company’s history that goes in an IPO prospectus. Institutional investors buy shares based on that prospectus, and when the company does go public, its merits can be judged harshly by Wall Street traders, as happened with Uber when it went public in 2019, and its stock price immediately plunged. Companies can also sense which way the wind is blowing if things aren’t going well, and withdraw an IPO before the company gets humiliated, as happened with Ari Emmanuel’s talent agency Endeavor Group in the same year as Uber’s humiliating debut. In a livestream on Tuesday, Sam Altman made similarly grandiose claims about 13-figure sums of money. According to Axios, he said eventually he’d like to build one gigawatt’s worth of new data center capacity per week, which he expects to cost 20 billion per gigawatt. Add it up yourself, and that’s over $1 trillion per year. “Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we’re on a pretty steep curve towards that,” he claimed. He also added (again, per Axios) that going public “is the most likely path for us given the capital needs that we’ll have and, sort of, the size of the company.”Â Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. The "electrocution" in this analogy is a lawsuit. OpenAI has been catching more heat for alleged copyright infringement, and now companies like Square Enix and Ghibli have put their foot down. The de Blasio "impersonator" was profiled in 2020. But he didn't have AI back then. On an earnings call, Zuck acknowledged that Metaâs massive AI spend might not go as intended in the near future. The rise of artificial intelligence is driving a surge of data center construction across the United States, and rural communities are feeling the impact. The old OpenAI is dead.

Title: 5 Shopify Mistakes That Kill Holiday Profits

Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:42Z

Minor configuration mistakes during the busy Christmas selling season can seriously harm ecommerce profits. Shopify remains the most popular ecommerce platform in the United States. Various sources report that the company has about 29% of the total U.S. hosted ecommerce platform market, or about 21% of the top 1 million ecommerce sites worldwide. Shopify is popular, in part, because of its relative ease of use. The setup is speedy for online sellers willing to accept out-of-the-box themes and a default configuration. Unfortunately, that configuration can also lead to mistakes. What follows are five Shopify setup errors that kill profits when holiday sales rev up. Product feeds to Google and Meta can fail silently. A price mismatch, missing GTIN, or out-of-stock flag can lead to disapprovals that stop some ads from running even while the campaign spends otherwise. Before the holiday rush, store owners and managers should review product feeds aimed at dynamic advertising. In Shopify, this means checking “Google & YouTube,” “Facebook & Instagram,” and any other connected sales app. Each should show products approved and synchronized. A merchant might also notice this when checking product sales channels. Shopify adds a warning if there is a feed problem. A store manager checking for missing channels (below) might have noticed something wrong with the “Google & YouTube” feed. Shopify merchants sometimes assume that publishing a product to their online store automatically makes it visible on Google Shopping, Meta, the Shop app, and Pinterest. It does not. Shopify treats each sales channel separately, and products do not appear in a channel unless explicitly added. This may be true even when an app is installed correctly. Channel exclusion happens frequently for stores selling print-on-demand products such as t-shirts. A shopkeeper might design and publish a t-shirt with Printful and add it to a Shopify collection, unaware that it wasn’t added to every channel. To check, go to “Products” in Shopify and filter by excluded sales channels. Bulk-add any missing channels. Visibility is a foundation of conversion. If an item is not syndicated to every active channel, it might as well not exist. Shopify’s shipping options are flexible and configurable. They can be confusing, too, prompting some ecommerce operations to select a few simple options. Unfortunately, keeping it simple may not work during the holiday crunch. Last-minute holiday shoppers often want lightning-fast delivery and are willing to pay for it. The trouble is that many stores never offer it. In Shopify, go to “Settings” > “Shipping and Delivery.” Open each profile and make sure every product belongs to it. Add at least one two-day or overnight option using carrier-calculated rates. Consider posting a clear cutoff message — such as “Order by Dec. 18 for Christmas delivery.” — on product detail pages. Fast, flexible fulfillment often matters more than price in late December. Shoppers will not buy without a proper delivery option. Shopify’s discount system is powerful and literal. Run multiple promotions at once, and the platform could apply them all unless told otherwise. Ensure discounts work as expected. To be clear, applying multiple discounts to a single order, product, or transaction simultaneously is a valid sales tactic. Plenty of retailers use this approach. Hence discount stacking is built into Shopify. A storewide 20% sale, combined with free shipping and a loyalty code, can materially boost holiday revenue and, potentially, instantly erase margins. Before launching any campaign, open “Discounts” and check for overlapping date ranges or stackable coupons. Consider limiting the store to one automatic or sitewide discount at a time — test checkouts with several products in the cart. Merchants on Shopify Plus may also want to audit their Scripts or Functions. Strong Christmas sales can push a store past tax nexus thresholds — the point at which a merchant is legally required to collect and remit sales tax in a state. Shopify doesn’t necessarily detect new tax requirements automatically. The store may owe taxes if its revenue or transaction volume crosses a given state’s threshold. The problem usually shows up after December, when accountants discover a state in which the store met the threshold but never registered. That missed setup can mean back taxes, penalties, and months of cleanup. Before peak season, review Shopify tax settings. Add every state where the business has physical presence, employees, warehouses, or meets an economic nexus threshold. That threshold is often $100,000 in annual sales or 200 transactions. Enable Shopify Tax or a third-party app such as Avalara to maintain accurate rates. International stores should check “Markets” to confirm the correct VAT and customs settings.

Title: AI chipmaker Nvidia becomes first $5 trillion company

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Nvidia has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was first to break through the $4 trillion barrier. Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that’s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. But there are concerns of a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday the shares closed at $207.04 with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.03 trillion. In comparison, Nvidia's value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Demand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting, saying that the generative AI chatbots that were merely “interesting” when they first took hold a few years ago are now becoming so useful that they will be profitable. Huang was heading to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, are gathering for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping U.S. tariffs on technology and other products. The multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event — a face-to-face meeting on Thursday between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act. On Tuesday, Huang disclosed $500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers. Last month Nvidia announced that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. In August, Huang said that Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he will speak with Xi about Nvidia's chips on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion. Then, Nvidia announced last month that it’s investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.

Big reason Nvidia is appreciating is a "VC" pole position, as they are cutting many 'equity' deals with their customers, like OpenAI, with enormous growth potential, but rely heavily on Nvidia's chips to bring to $realization This is fascinating. That's larger than the gdp of Germany, which is the third largest economy as of 2025. Of course, gdp is annul while stock market valuation is not. If compared with the stock market of nations, Nvdia, alone, would be in the top 5. Nonetheless, as much of this has to do with government interference, and speculation, it seems to be fragile. Certainly, there will be many benefits, however, as said, the fact that a lot of this is government driven will invetably make the burst more intense - just as it makes the boom more intense.

Title: Investment Bank Mizuho Says Visa Is Becoming the ‘Stablecoin of Stablecoins’
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/29/investment-bank-mizuho-says-visa-is-becoming-the-stablecoin-of-stablecoins
Time Published: 2025-10-29T17:05:20Z
Full Content:
Japanese investment bank Mizuho called Visa (V) the “stablecoin of stablecoins,” arguing that the payments giant has become a core part of the global stablecoin infrastructure. Visa’s expanding network of stablecoin-linked card programs, now over 130 in more than 40 countries, with spending up fourfold year-on-year, gives it a central role in blockchain-based payments, according to the Wednesday report. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. Tether's USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC. The bank has an outperform rating on Visa shares with a $425 price target. The stock was 1% lower, around $343.30, at publication time. Visa could emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of stablecoin adoption, helped by momentum from the GENIUS Act and its long-running Visa Direct initiative, analysts Dan Dolev and Alexander Jenkins wrote. Visa Direct has grown about 50% annually since 2016 and now accounts for roughly 15%–20% of global debit volume, or over $1.1 trillion, they said. With a growing array of stablecoins, from USDT and USDC to PayPal’s PYUSD and various central bank projects, the analysts said a centralized hub like Visa offers a powerful competitive advantage. The analysts also pointed to Visa’s move to let banks mint and burn their own stablecoins using its tokenized asset platform, suggesting that individual stablecoins such as USDC are becoming interchangeable, and that networks like Visa or Mastercard (MA) will ultimately capture the most value. Visa currently supports four stablecoins on its platform, USDG, PYUSD, EURC and USDC. Mizuho said this is only the beginning. As stablecoins become more commoditized, the bank sees Visa’s role as the “network of networks” or “stablecoin of stablecoins” as a key long-term growth driver. The bank's analysts reiterated its view that Circle (CRCL), the issuer of USDC, is overvalued, maintaining an underperform rating and an $84 price target. Circle shares fell 3.45%, trading around $131.37 at publication time.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone. Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates. Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand. Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team. Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Title: Nvidia's market capitalization hits $5.12 trillion — AI powerhouse is the first company in history to hit seismic milestone

The most expensive company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The market capitalization of Nvidia passed the $5 trillion mark on Wednesday, following a host of potentially lucrative deals and projects the company announced at its GPU Technology Conference event on Tuesday. The company's stock price continues to be driven by the broad interest towards artificial intelligence and Nvidia's unique position in the AI supply chain that now spans from humble chips for inference to gigawatt-scale data centers for massive AI training. At its GTC 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., Nvidia made a number of announcements that could potentially bring tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in revenue to the company in the coming years. Among the highlights announced by Nvidia are reference designs for gargantuan gigawatt-scale AI data centers that will let newcomers to build new AI factories using Nvidia blueprints and hardware; partnership with Palantir to build an integrated stack for operational AI; the deal with Uber to use Nvidia's Level 4 AGX Drive Hyperion platform for its fleet of autonomous robotaxis as well as adoption of the same platform by Mercedes, Stellantis, Volvo, Lucid, and Foxconn; NVQLink technology to attach Nvidia GPUs to quantum computers; partnership to build AI-RAN products with Nokia; contracts to build seven AI supercomputers for the U.S. government; and plans to build AI-native 6G networks in the U.S. together with partners. The new announcements place Nvidia at the center of the large-scale AI supply chain, which will drive demand for the company's hardware and software solutions. Nvidia's AI platform comprises numerous products, including GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, NVLink switches, and Ethernet and Infiniband solutions. If one wants to build an Nvidia-based cluster or data center for AI, they will inevitably procure plenty of Nvidia-designed hardware and software to build it and operate it. While for now Nvidia supplies AI hardware to companies like AWS, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI, in the coming years, it is going to expand its total addressable market to both established players across industries (e.g., Lilly is already building its own AI data center) and new players that have yet to become significant in their realms. Even established companies are increasing their demands for AI GPUs. For example, Nvidia supplied about four million Hopper-based AI GPUs throughout the architecture's active lifetime, and shipments of Blackwell stand at six million units now and yet have to peak. With new participants entering the AI field, sales of Nvidia's hardware are poised to skyrocket. Nvidia's unique position in the growing AI supply chain places it well above other semiconductor and high-tech companies as far as market capitalization is concerned. The company at press time cost over a trillion dollars more than Apple ($4.011 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.995 trillion), nearly two trillion dollars more than Alphabet ($3.257 trillion), and two times more than Amazon ($2.444 billion). Interestingly, TSMC — the key supplier to Nvidia that produces all of its silicon — now has a market capitalization of $1.582 trillion, whereas ASML — the key supplier to TSMC — now costs $416.5 billion. Market capitalization of Nvidia's traditional rivals — AMD and Intel — stands at $429 billion and $197 billion, respectively.

Title: 20 Years on Wall Street Taught Me: Dividend Blue-Chips You Never Sell

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After a career spanning two decades at Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, I gained an institutional perspective on dividend stock investing. My tenure at these premier Wall Street firms exposed me to fundamental analysis, credit evaluation, and risk management practices, which directly translate into selecting quality dividend-paying companies. Having witnessed firsthand the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath—including the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, from which I was fortunately spared as I had left both firms by 2004—I developed a keen appreciation for balance sheet strength, sustainable payout ratios, and the importance of dividends as a stabilizing force during market turbulence. By analyzing cash flow generation, capital allocation strategies, and management quality, I can identify companies with durable competitive advantages and the financial discipline to maintain and grow their dividends through economic cycles. Early in my career, I realized that dividend investing is not merely an income strategy, but also a comprehensive framework for building wealth through companies that consistently return capital to shareholders while maintaining financial stability. Five top companies are the bedrock and pinnacle for dividend investors. All are the kind of stocks that growth and income investors can buy now, tomorrow, next week, or next year and hold for the long term. All are rated Buy at top Wall Street firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973 to 2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is the world’s fourth-largest telecommunications company, measured by revenue. The legacy telecommunications company has been undergoing a lengthy restructuring process while maintaining a solid dividend of 4.24%. Seventeen analysts have given the stock a Buy rating, indicating comprehensive Wall Street support. AT&T provides a range of telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. Its Communications segment offers wireless voice and data communications services. AT&T sells through its company-owned stores, agents, and third-party retail stores: AT&T also provides: Additionally, this segment provides residential customers with broadband fiber and legacy telephony voice communication services. It markets its communications services and products under: The company’s Latin America segment provides wireless services in Mexico and video services throughout the region. This segment markets its services and products under the AT&T and Unefon brands. Raymond James has a Strong Buy rating with a $33 price target for the stock. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1892. It remains a top long-time holding of Warren Buffett, who owns a massive 400 million shares and pays a dependable 2.94% dividend. Coca-Cola is the world’s largest beverage company, offering consumers more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, one of the world’s most valuable and recognizable brands, the company’s portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including: Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees, juices, and juice drinks. Through the world’s most extensive beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the company’s beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. It’s also important to remember that the company owns 16.7% of Monster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST), which continues to deliver big numbers. UBS has a Buy rating with an $80 target price. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the world’s largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies. The decline in oil prices presents investors with an excellent entry point, and they will likely seize the opportunity to secure a strong 3.48% dividend yield. Exxon is the world’s largest international integrated oil and gas company, exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania. The energy giant also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics, as well as specialty products. Additionally, the company transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Top Wall Street analysts expect the company to remain a key beneficiary in a stable oil price environment. Most remain very optimistic about the company’s sharp positive inflection in capital allocation strategy, particularly in the Upstream portfolio and its leverage to a further demand recovery. Exxon offers greater Downstream/Chemicals exposure than its peers. Exxon completed its purchase of oil shale giant Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock transaction valued at $59.5 billion in 2024. The deal created the largest U.S. oilfield producer and guarantees a decade of low-cost production. UBS has a Buy rating on the shares with an $80 target price. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is the fifth-largest bank in the world by assets. This stock trades at a reasonable 12.5 times estimated 2026 earnings with a 1.84% dividend. JPMorgan is one of the leading global financial services firms and one of the largest banking institutions in the US, with about $3.9 trillion in assets. The company was formed by merging the Chase Manhattan retail banks and the J.P. Morgan investment banks. The company operates through four segments: The CCB segment offers: Credit cards, auto loans, leases, and travel services are offered to consumers and small businesses through bank branches, ATMs, and digital and telephone banking. The CIB segment provides: This segment also offers securities services, including custody, fund accounting and administration, and securities lending products for asset managers, insurance companies, and public and private investment funds. The CB segment provides financial solutions, including lending, payments, investment banking, and asset management to small and midsized companies, local governments, nonprofit clients, and large corporations, as well as investors, developers, and owners of multifamily, office, retail, industrial, and affordable housing properties. The AWM segment offers multi-asset investment management solutions in equities, fixed income, alternatives, and money market funds to institutional clients and retail investors. It also provides brokerage, custody, estate planning, lending, deposits, and investment management products, as well as retirement products and services, to high-net-worth clients. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a monster $366 price target. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) was founded more than 185 years ago as a soap and candle company. It has paid dividends to shareholders since 1891, raised them for 70 straight years, and currently pays a 2.72% dividend. The company is focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods to consumers worldwide. The company’s segments include: The company’s products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, including social commerce channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores, including airport duty-free stores, high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores, and professional channels.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/netflix-stock-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T14:42:38Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has shown remarkable performance, increasing by 45% in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately $1,100 for each share. This surge has been fueled by the company's efforts to tackle password sharing and the introduction of its advertising-supported streaming option, although the stock has experienced a minor sell-off in recent times. After reaching a peak of roughly $1,340 in June, it has declined due to Q3 earnings that fell short of expectations, resulting in Netflix revenues and margins coming in below projections. Despite the recent drop, the stock still trades at around 45 times the forecasted earnings. We think the stock faces significant downside risk at such high levels. With increasing macroeconomic uncertainties and indications that subscriber growth may decelerate, investors might be overlooking possible risks. In our opinion, the stock could decline drastically — potentially falling below $500 per share. A 50% correction may seem drastic, but it would not be without precedent. This has occurred before and could likely happen again. However, any potential correction would not necessarily arise from a breakdown in Netflix’s fundamentals, but rather from a recalibration of its valuation multiple as growth begins to stabilize. Investing in single stocks can be risky, yet there is significant value in utilizing a broader, diversified strategy. If you're looking for some upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) — HQ has outperformed its benchmark, a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential — consider what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you incorporated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ's performance metrics. Netflix's subscriber growth could eventually decelerate as significant measures like the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported plans have typically been implemented across major markets. These initiatives were substantial strategic changes aimed at creating new revenue streams and enlarging the user base after growth stagnated following the pandemic. However, demand may have been pulled forward that might have otherwise emerged over the next few years, leading to softer subscriber additions in the future. The company’s intent to cease reporting subscriber figures from 2025 might also reflect internal expectations for slower growth ahead. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid user count to nearly 302 million by the end of the year, marking a record annual increase that considerably propelled the stock’s upward trajectory. Growth was mainly stimulated by the crackdown on password sharing, which incentivized users to either purchase extra member access or create new accounts. Simultaneously, the ad-supported tier gained substantial traction, with Netflix reporting last quarter that it had over 94 million ad-supported users. While Netflix is becoming more efficient in monetizing its ads, subscriber growth has been a fundamental driver of the company’s expansion. With these significant growth levers now mostly exhausted, Netflix may find it challenging to maintain its present momentum, which could have repercussions on the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty and rising costs could also pressure Netflix, which heavily relies on consumer spending. The introduction of tariffs on essential trading partners is already causing inflation in the U.S. to rise. This may decrease disposable income and, in turn, potentially weaken consumer spending. This situation could be detrimental for Netflix, which depends on discretionary income. Additionally, Netflix’s plans have become pricier, with its premium plan now priced at $25 a month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This may result in a slowdown in new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content expenses are set to increase as it delves deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, which typically incur higher production and licensing costs. Although the recent decline in Q3 operating margin to 28% — against a predicted 31.5% — largely resulted from an unforeseen tax dispute in Brazil, margins may remain susceptible as spending pressures accumulate. For the entirety of 2025, Netflix now anticipates an operating margin of 29%, slightly down from its earlier forecast of 30%. NFLX stock has experienced slightly better performance compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent market downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go In A Market Crash presents a detailed analysis of how S&P stocks performed during and after prior market crashes. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2008 Global Financial Crisis But the risk isn’t confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings reports, company updates, or outlook modifications. Check out NFLX Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from significant dips in the past. At the current share price of $1,100, Netflix trades at approximately 45 times consensus earnings for 2025 and around 34 times the consensus earnings for 2026, which is high compared to historical standards. In contrast, the stock was trading at approximately 20 times earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial results have been robust, markets can be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the distant future. In Netflix’s situation, the prevailing assumption is that the company will sustain its strong sequence of subscriber acquisitions and likely grow revenues comfortably in double digits. Nevertheless, there’s a real chance that Netflix will soon witness a slowdown in growth, as the combined advantages of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, all while economic uncertainties continue to rise in the U.S. Essentially, the downside risk here lies less in Netflix’s business viability and more in the extent to which investors are prepared to pay for its next phase of slower, more mature growth. Worried about Netflix stock's high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

We're covering the devastating consequences of the government's inaction. Support the journalism that holds our leaders to account. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Nvidia has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was first to break through the $4 trillion barrier. Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that’s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. But there are concerns of a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday the shares touched $207.86 in early morning trading with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.05 trillion. In comparison, Nvidia’s value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Demand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting, saying that the generative AI chatbots that were merely “interesting” when they first took hold a few years ago are now becoming so useful that they will be profitable. Huang was heading to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, are gathering for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping U.S. tariffs on technology and other products. The multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event — a face-to-face meeting on Thursday between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act. On Tuesday, Huang disclosed $500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers. Last month Nvidia announced that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. In August, Huang said that Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he will speak with Xi about Nvidia’s chips on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered a significant $51 billion back to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems from Broadcom's position as a dominant supplier of mission-critical semiconductor chips and infrastructure software, where the company operates in markets with exceptionally high barriers to entry and generates industry-leading margins that convert revenue into pure cash flow. Broadcom’s cash machine operates on two highly profitable pillars: its semiconductor solutions business that generates $34 billion (LTM) with products so essential to data center, networking, and mobile infrastructure, and its infrastructure software division producing $26 billion through mission-critical enterprise software, including VMware's virtualization platform that customers rely on for their core operations. The company’s business model is particularly cash-generative because it focuses on high-margin, recurring revenue streams, allowing Broadcom to convert approximately $24+ billion annually into free cash flow from its $51.6 billion revenue base. Let's examine some statistics and see how this cash return capability compares to the largest capital-return companies in the market. Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd highest for total returns to shareholders in history. Why should this matter to you? Because dividends and stock buybacks provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s fiscal health and capability to generate sustainable cash inflows. Additionally, there are numerous other stocks like this. Here’s a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. For comprehensive rankings, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The total amount of capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth expectations for reinvestment opportunities. Companies like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significantly faster growth, more predictably when compared to their counterparts, but have returned a much smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders. This represents the downside of high capital returns. Certainly, they are appealing, but you need to ask yourself: Am I compromising on growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping this in mind, let’s review some data for AVGO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for more insight) That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. That said, AVGO is not immune to significant downturns. It experienced a nearly 48% drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, around 35% during the 2021 inflation shock, and approximately 27% during the 2018 correction. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Go – for more details. Even with robust fundamentals, it is evident that the stock can undergo substantial declines when market conditions change. Quality companies still suffer when market sentiment shifts abruptly. However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider circumstances like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in forecasts. Check AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines historically. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
