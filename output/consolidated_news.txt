US-based technology giant Amazon announced its plans to invest up to $50 billion into the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities for the US government agencies through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to an official announcement. Amazon's investment in the expansion is aimed at improving the discovery and decision-making ability of the government agencies as they integrate their simulation and modeling data with AI, autonomous experimental steering and real-time feedback loops. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” said AWS CEO Matt Garman. “This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Amazon Web Services' (AWS) up to $50 billion investment is set to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. The company will build data centres with advanced computing and networking technology power as part of its expansion efforts. According to the official announcement, the federal government agencies will gain expanded access to AWS's comprehensive AI services, including Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, and Anthropic Claude, among other things. “These new capabilities will be available to existing and future U.S. government customers across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and GovCloud (US) Regions, strengthening America's AI leadership and giving federal agencies the secure, scalable infrastructure they need for the next era of innovation,” the company said in its announcement. The investment will also contribute to critical US government and industrial base missions ranging from national security to scientific research and innovation, which includes autonomous systems development, cybersecurity, energy innovation, and healthcare research. According to a recent report from CNBC, Amazon's move comes after Meta and Anthropic's decision to expand AI data centres in the United States, and Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank's plan to invest $500 billion in the country's AI infrastructure. Amazon share price jumped more than 1% to $228.64 during the intraday trading session on Tuesday as of 11:53 a.m. (IST), compared to $226.28 at the previous US stock market session, according to the MarketWatch data. Shares of the tech and e-commerce giant have given more than 43% returns in the last five years, and over 14% returns in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Amazon shares are trading 4.39% higher in 2025. The shares of Amazon hit their 52-week high level at $258.60, while the 52-week low level stood at $161.38, according to the MarketWatch data. The company's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.42 trillion as of the stock market session on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.

Title: Apple Sales Layoffs Hit Dozens Despite Record Revenue

The company frames the move as restructuring rather than financial trouble, potentially signaling a shift toward third-party resellers and new strategic priorities. When business is good, companies tend to hire more people in order to meet the demand. However, when business is bad or slow, that’s when companies conduct layoffs. But are things going badly at Apple, so much so that the company is conducting layoffs across different sales roles? That’s what’s allegedly happening, according to a report from Bloomberg. According to the report, Apple has eliminated roles primarily within its enterprise sales division. The affected positions include account managers handling corporate, education, and government clients. It also includes employees at Apple’s briefing centers, where the company hosts high-level product demonstrations for major customers. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as Apple doing badly. Instead, Apple frames these layoffs at its sales division as a restructuring to streamline operations and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. The company says it’s still hiring in other areas and has encouraged affected staff to apply for open internal positions. Some employees have been given deadlines to find new roles within Apple before receiving their severance packages. According to some affected employees, they believe the company is shifting more enterprise business to third-party resellers. This means potentially reduced salary and support costs. The government sales team appears to be hit particularly hard. The division was already struggling with federal budget constraints and a prolonged US government shutdown that slowed the closing of deals. Apple has built a reputation for treating layoffs as an absolute last resort. While competitors spent 2023 and 2024 cutting thousands of positions, Apple largely avoided massive workforce reductions. This is versus other tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies slashed thousands of jobs during recent downturns. What makes these Apple sales layoffs interesting and kind of weird is the timing. The company recently reported approximately $140 billion in revenue for the December quarter. Like we said, companies tend to cut jobs when things are bad. But cutting jobs during strong financial performance sends a different message. Perhaps this is Apple’s way of diverting its resources to other investments, like in AI, where it appears to be currently struggling. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The Railway Bubble vs. the AI Bubble

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 25, 2025 by Ben Carlson Everyone is trying to put the massive AI spend by technology companies into context. The easiest historical analogies are the telecomm buildout in the 1990s dot-com bubble and the railway bubbles of the 1800s. Each period was defined by excessive infrastructure spending, investor euphoria, and bubbles that popped but still had lasting positive effects. I’m familiar with the railway bubble because I wrote an entire chapter about that time frame in my book Don’t Fall For It. While the similarities between then and now are striking, there were far more nefarious activities that occurred during the 19th century. What follows is a condensed version of what appeared in my book. ******* Innovation breeds change, change breeds emotion, and emotion adds fuel to the fire when making money decisions. There’s a reason financial bubbles are called manias — they elicit heightened levels of energy, excitement, and activity. Hucksters are drawn to financial manias like moths to a flame because it’s easier to deceive people when they think humanity is entering a “new era” or “paradigm shift.” George Hudson saw the British railway bubble of the mid-19th century as an opportune time to profit from the excitement in the air. There was a wave of innovation taking place, and the emotions of the crowd who were looking to get rich quickly led to one of the more underrated historical bubbles on record. Like most bubbles, the railway mania actually started out as a good idea that was taken too far by investors and those selling railway projects alike. The first commuter trains appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1820s. They traveled just 12.5 miles per hour which reduced the trip from London to Glasgow to 24 hours. Without a hint of sarcasm The Railway Times asked, “What more could any reasonable man want?” The initial railway mania hit in 1825 with the opening of the first steam engine train. An economic downturn snuffed out any speculation and by 1840, shares of the main railway companies were selling at a discount to their issue price (stocks acted more like bonds than stocks back then). At this point, 2,000 miles of track were complete, leading some to speculate that the national railway system in Britain was already finished. Memories are short when people think there’s money to be made so this first mini-mania in railway stocks became a distant memory by the summer of 1842. That’s when Prince Albert of the Royal Family persuaded Queen Victoria to make her first train ride. That was the all-clear investors needed to hop aboard the railway-stock train. By 1844, investors viewed these companies as safe and secure, with huge upside potential. It didn’t take long for that cautious optimism to morph into reckless euphoria. George Hudson was one of the original modern capitalists, using publicity, salesmanship, and a cult of personality to attract enormous amounts of capital and goodwill from the public. Best described by his contemporaries as energetic, abrasive, bullying, penny pinching, rule-bending and overweight, Hudson was also a shrewd businessman who knew how to persuade people. Innovation helped trains travel further distances and carry heavier loads so Hudson pounced on the opportunity by creating his own line of railways in the 1830s. Through a series of consolidations, mergers, schemes, bribes, acquisitions, and an uncanny ability to sell, Hudson consolidated more power than anyone in the industry, eventually creating the largest railway company in Britain. By 1844, Hudson oversaw one-third of the total tracks in operation, measuring over one thousand miles in distance. He was the embodiment of the get-rich-quick era of the railway mania. Company heads were not paid the astronomical sums CEOs can earn today so Hudson became frustrated with how little he was earning for his work. Cutting corners was his solution to increase his wealth. Auditing was basically non-existent at the time which allowed Hudson to go nuts. He did this by keeping his fellow directors and shareholders in the dark about the inner workings of his companies. This included a refusal to hold finance meetings, changes to accounting methods, and general obfuscation about the financial statements. When Hudson joined the board of one railway company in 1842, his first order of business was announcing an immediate change to the company’s accounting methods, proclaiming, “I will have no statistics on my railway!” Nearly five hundred new railway companies were in existence by the summer of 1845, with stock prices in the sector up a cool 500 percent. As share prices rose during the 1840s so too did Hudson’s bank account. The palatial estate he purchased at the entrance to Hyde Park was the largest private home in all of London. His name became synonymous with success as the mere mention of his name by promoters provided enough credibility for the sale of stock on a new railway project. Hudson quickly became one of the most prominent figures in the social and political class of Great Britain in the nineteenth century through a combination of wealth, fame, and charisma. Although he was skilled at selling, Hudson didn’t exactly have to twist anyone’s arm to invest in these new products. Money was flowing in faster than Usain Bolt with the wind at his back. By June 1945 the Board of Trade was considering over eight thousand miles of new railway, which was four times more than the existing system and almost twenty times the length of England. There were literally plans for tracks that started nowhere and went nowhere with no stops along the way. The estimated cost of the nearly twelve hundred railways under consideration was more than £560 million. That was more than the national income of the entire country! The most mind-boggling aspect of all this money pouring in is that it all came from private investors. This wasn’t the government investing in the infrastructure of their country but investors who were looking to get rich. There were just three railway journals at the outset of the 1840s, led by the Railway Times. By the time the mania reached its zenith in 1845, there were fourteen bi-weekly railway papers, two daily editions, and one which was published every day in both the morning and the evening. At the start of 1845, sixteen new railway proposals were underway and over 50 new companies were formed to meet this demand. Advertisements flooded the newspapers and periodicals. The media pounced on the Queen Victoria train ride, proclaiming the railways as a revolutionary development for mankind, sparking interest from the public in all things rail travel. Hudson was far ahead of the game in terms of understanding the power of the press and how to use it to expand his empire. It helped that he had a financial interest in three newspapers that would all run flattering pieces about his projects to attract investors. There is a rumor that Hudson even tried to support a radical new publication called the Daily News and have Charles Dickens as the editor. Dickens was not a fan of Hudson and supposedly remarked, “that he [Dickens] should be the last man in the world to be a supporter of it.” The schemes worked like this: newspaper ads would promise a 10 percent dividend for anyone who put money into a new railway project. If the project got enough funding, the directors would hold onto a large allocation of shares in the newly formed corporation. This created enough scarcity to push up the price from the flood of new investors which thereby allowed the directors to flood the market with their shares by selling at a premium price. George Hudson was a master at this scheme, promising unsustainable dividend yields of 50 percent to inflate the share prices on certain issues, which only encouraged more insider trading by himself and the company directors. These were blatant pump and dump schemes. The investing public didn’t seem to care. Parliament published a report in the summer of 1845 revealing the identity of twenty thousand investors who had subscribed for at least £2,000 or more worth of railway stocks. Hudson’s name was on there, of course, but so were 157 members of Parliament and almost 260 clergymen. Investors included the likes of Charles Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and the Bronte sisters. Darwin is said to have lost up to 60 percent in the aftermath of the mania and that was actually much better than most fared in the bloodbath that followed. The rest were mostly regular people, showing how broad the speculation was. Many investors were subscribed for more shares than they could ever hope to pay for but the idea was they would all have the chance to sell at a premium before getting all of their capital called in to create the actual railway projects. Most people assumed the greater fool theory applied but no one planned on being the last fool standing. The mania was particularly strong in the suburbs because these were the areas that could see the biggest impact from the infrastructure buildout from the new train tracks. In one town, there was a group of stockbrokers who would take an express train twice a day to relay information from one town to the next on the latest changes in share prices for the railway stocks. Practically all the money for the construction of the railways came from individuals. By 1850, the amount invested was around £250 million, almost half the GDP of Great Britain at the time. There’s an old saying that markets take the stairs up but the elevator down and the railway stocks were no different. Rising interest rates were the first pinprick in the railway bubble in the summer of 1845. Increased competition and overinvestment finally brought these companies back to earth. Bankruptcies hit an all-time high in 1846, just a year after the height of the mania. People from all walks of life and levels of wealth were ruined. By the start of 1850, railway share prices had fallen an astronomical 85 percent on average. By 1849, Hudson’s role as Railway King came to an unceremonious end. Four of the railway companies he was heavily involved in were under investigation. The shady personal transactions, embezzlement of company funds, overstating of profits, bribing members of Parliament to push his projects through, and insider trading schemes were all made public. The twelve reports produced about his business dealings forever changed public perception of the once-revered businessman. The high society Hudson so eagerly sought to be a part of immediately turned their back on him. Hudson was never prosecuted in a court of law because securities laws at the time didn’t protect shareholders the way they do now. But he was tried and convicted in the court of public opinion and ostracized by the elite class, which may have been even more of a blow to his gigantic ego. The press sang Hudson’s praises when things were going well but turned their back on him when things went awry. The Railway Times published what was basically his business obituary but they also came down hard on the investors who went along for the ride: He no more caused the railway mania than Napoleon caused the French Revolution. He was its child, its ornaments, and its boast. His talent for organisation was prodigious. No labour or speculation seemed to vast for his powers. He combined and systematised the attacks of a hundred bands upon the public purse; he raised all the fares, he lowered the speed, he reduced the establishments, he ‘cooked’ all the reports, and he trebled all the shares. The shareholders wanted their dividends doubled, and their shares raised to a proportionate market value, They never calculated the extent to which these achievements were honestly practicable, or considered the measures to which it would be necessary to resort. They wanted the trick done all at once and Hudson was the man to do it. Hudson was able to stay afloat in political life for a few years after the bubble had burst but was eventually arrested for not paying his debts and died broke years later. A large number of tech start-ups with seemingly good ideas went out of business after the dot-com flameout. But that era planted the seeds for the next wave of innovation that occurred, which gave us services like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said, “All those ideas are working today. I can’t think of a single idea from that era that isn’t working today.” The railway boom and bust had some positive outcomes as well. Not all was lost from this period of untamed speculation, greed, and accounting fraud. By 1855, there were over 8,000 miles of railroad track in operation, giving Britain the highest density of railroad tracks in the world, measuring seven times the length of France or Germany. The railways set up during the bubble years came to represent 90 percent of the total length of the current British railway system. People and businesses across the country experienced massive gains in efficiency through cheaper and faster transportation of raw materials, finished products, and passengers. During the 1840s more than half a million people were employed by the railway companies to make those tracks a reality. Tens of thousands of people from Ireland were provided employment throughout their famine years. In many ways, this was a wealth transfer from rich and middle-class speculators to the labor class that simultaneously provided the country with much needed transportation infrastructure. News distribution spread, and the capital markets became more mature. New stock markets were set up in cities all over the country. Stock brokerage firms grew from six in 1830 to almost thirty by 1847. There was greater innovation during the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century but the railway boom required far more capital, and thus investors, so this changed the way the middle class invested their money. The problem for those trying to handicap the financial ramifications of this innovation is that the economic impact doesn’t always occur at the same time. Investors extrapolate innovation indefinitely into the future, carrying prices too far, too fast. It took time for the combustion engine to completely replace the horse and carriage. The promises of the Internet came true, but we had to live through the dot-com crash to get there. Excitement pervades when new technologies are released. Most of the early car companies flamed out. As car ownership first took off in the 1920s there were 108 automakers in the U.S. By the 1950s, they were whittled down to the big three. The entire airline industry basically lost money or went out of business in the century after air travel was invented. But investors become so enthusiastic they never stop to wonder what could go wrong, only how the world could change, and more importantly, how rich they will become in the process. The siren song of innovation means there will invariably be a new gold rush every time we collectively get excited about a shiny new toy. Those innovations may change the way we live but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to make you wealthy in the process. ******* I wrote this 6 years ago before ChatGPT was a thing and no one was talking about AI. It’s interesting to revisit now. Is AI the next railway bubble? The next dot-com bubble? It might not be the worst outcome.

Title: Trump could make a decision on a new Fed chair 'before Christmas.' See who's on the short list

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas. "I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas," Bessent told CNBC in late November. "But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well." No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank. "I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people," Bessent said. Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement. Here are the five finalists. Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms. During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020. In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market." Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well. "I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting," Waller told Fox Business in late November. Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with "experience." It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank. "I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that," he said. Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him. Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's. In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times. In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years. Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were "the top three" to replace Powell. Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017. Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House. Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street. From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for "regime change" at the Fed. "The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them," Warsh told CNBC in July. "So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy." In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank. After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision. Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official. In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent. There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers. Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names. CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James "Jim" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention. Jump to

A Dublin-based Chinese businessman has been jailed for seven years and nine months over a money-laundering operation connected to an international €10 million “zombie” iPhone fraud. Chengwen Guo (43), who was described in court as the “Irish representative of a transnational crime organisation”, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to theft and money-laundering offences on dates between 2021 and 2022. Guo, of Ivy Exchange, Parnell Street, Dublin, owned a number of mobile phone shops called Murray Mobile, with eight stores in locations including Blackrock, Dundrum, Sutton Cross, Ranelagh and Newbridge. Guo has one previous conviction for having a false passport at Gatwick Airport in the UK, for which he received a custodial sentence of 13 months, the court was told. The court heard three sums of money seized in January 2022 included €6,515 found in an Audi Q7 car registered to Guo; €143,245 at his home address; and €20,700 at Murray Mobiles on Main Street in Dundrum, Dublin 14. Three Rolex watches were also found when gardaí searched his Parnell Street apartment in Dublin. His Audi has yet to be seized, the court heard. Judge Martin Nolan described Guo as “a very energetic man” who had engaged in “very substantial criminal misbehaviour”. “This man deserves a severe custodial sentence,” said Judge Nolan. The judge said it was “white-collar deviance”. The judge said “there was a gap there” and “the situation was found out”. The court was told the fake or “zombie” phones from China were exchanged under warranty for genuine iPhones which were then sent to countries outside of the EU for resale. The court heard 10,158 phones provided to Guo were last active mostly outside Ireland. The total retail value of the Apple products was €10,262,617. Det Sgt Robert Madden of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau told the court that representatives from Apple Corporation were in court for the hearing. The scheme operated on the basis of the Apple warranty on its phones. The fraud involved sending in fake iPhones for repair and then claiming a replacement under Apple’s one-year warranty scheme. These fake phone components would come from China and would be assigned the EMEI number of a genuine iPhone when sent for repair. The replacement genuine iPhones would then be sent to Hong Kong for resale to countries outside the EU. The court heard Guo also sold counterfeit Apple products such as power chargers, charging cables and phone cases in his shops. In July 2021, counterfeit Apple goods, including 15 damaged iPhones and sim trays, were found after a package was sent to Ireland addressed to “Johnny Cheng” – which the court heard was a name the defendant used in Ireland for its simplicity rather than his Chinese name – at Murray Mobile in Main Street, Dundrum. Gardaí commenced an investigation and searches of all eight Murray Mobile shops took place on January 10th, 2022. Last month, Guo’s co-accused, who was an employee of Fonfix, a tech repair business in Sandyford, south Dublin, was jailed in the same court. Lukasz Lupa (45) of Kukukcza, Wagrowiec, Poland was given a 4½-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of facilitating a criminal organisation on dates between June 5th, 2019, and September 3rd, 2021, under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006. Lupa had claimed he did not know what he was doing was illegal and received little financial benefit for his part in the warranty fraud. Det Sgt Madden said Apple realised that the number of units Guo was sending in was unusually high. He told Eoin Lawlor SC, prosecuting, the phones would not power on and a diagnostic could not be performed on them. The phones were submitted without proof of purchase in the name of a company that runs a legitimate business and was not at fault, the court heard. Guo received brand new phones and was getting €30 to €40 per unit. Diana Stuart SC, defending, told the court in mitigation that Guo has four children. One is in boarding school in the UK and one is in boarding school in Ireland. He also has a child in university in Edinburgh. His wife’s day-to-day living expenses amount to €1,000 a week, Ms Stuart told the court. Judge Nolan said the appropriate global sentence was one of seven years and nine months.

Title: Mother killed in attack near her Cork home had ‘inbuilt generosity’, funeral told

Mother of four Stella Gallagher had an “inbuilt generosity” and was always giving of herself and helping others, mourners at her funeral mass have heard. Her brother-in-law, Alan Gallagher, spoke with emotion as he delivered a eulogy to mourners, led by Ms Gallagher’s husband, Brian, and their daughter and sons, Ciara, Conor and Mark, at her funeral mass in Cork city on Tuesday. Ms Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her 63-year-old husband suffered serious injuries when they were attacked near their home at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough, Cork, on November 17th. Alan Gallagher told mourners at a packed Our Lady of Lourdes Church how he had asked his brother, niece and nephews what memories they had of Ms Gallagher and they said: “Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family.” He said: “Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them, whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip. “She had an inbuilt generosity and was always doing things for others or giving them things. If you mentioned in passing you liked something, the next time you saw her she’d have bought them for you or baked them for you or whatever. “It was the same when Stella was cooking food. When cooking for two people, she cooked enough for six. If you mentioned you had to go into town later, she’d get her car keys and offer to drop you in.” Mr Gallagher recalled the great pleasure and joy his sister-in-law derived from her involvement with the Togher Community Garden and the Cork Health Education Project Choir, based in nearby Blackrock, with whom she sang. “Stella was an excellent baker, and got pleasure from giving you scones or sourdough bread or apple tarts and she’d come in after losing track of time in her garden, delighted to be able to present you with her harvest of blackcurrants or potatoes or beetroot or whatever was in season. “Stella seemed to know the name of every flower and every tree, and on a recent visit to JFK Arboretum in Wexford she was like a child in a sweet shop. “We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will.” Celebrant Msgr Gearóid Dullea told mourners when people were confronted with death they experienced a maelstrom of emotions, and he said the shock and sadness over Ms Gallagher’s death spread far beyond her family and the community in Ballinlough. “Stella’s shocking death has brought a great pall of darkness, not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families, but also on so many others – Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle and over many friends.” Taoiseach Michéal Martin, who lives nearby in Ballinlough and spoke last week of how devastated the Gallagher family must be, was represented at the funeral his Aide de Camp, Comdt Joe Glennon. Ms Gallagher’s eldest son, David Gallagher (25), of Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, is due to reappear at Cork District Court on Wednesday. He was charged last week with his mother’s murder and with assault causing harm to his father, Brian Gallagher, at Shrewsbury Downs on November 17th.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. But White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly seen by advisers and allies of Trump as the frontrunner, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” Hassett appears to agree with Trump’s view of the economy, including that interest rates need to come down. He told Fox News during an interview on Nov. 20 that he would “be cutting rates right now” if he were the Fed chairman because “the data suggests that we should.” Hassett has also criticized central bankers for losing control of inflation. Fed officials, meanwhile, have been split on whether to cut interest rates further after two consecutive quarter-point cuts at the September and October meetings, down to the 3.75% to 4% range. Markets rebounded after New York Fed President John Williams said Friday there is room for “further adjustment in the near term” to interest rates. Traders are currently betting on 83% odds of a quarter-point cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, according to CME FedWatch. But Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan on Friday called for holding rates “for a time,” and Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she was “hesitant” about the next policy move since “restrictive policy is very appropriate right now.” Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said she’s approaching the December meeting “cautiously.” But Fed Governor Stephen Miran has said he would vote for a quarter-point cut if that meant the difference in getting lower rates. He has previously dissented in favor of a larger cut. Meanwhile, Bessent said he is hoping for the next chairman to bring the role into a new era. “I think we’ve got to kind of simplify things,” he said Tuesday. “I think it’s time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.” Advertisement

Title: Larry Page becomes second richest person in the world after Alphabet share rally — What's his net worth?

Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person in the world, just after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. thanks to a bumper and ongoing rally in Alphabet stocks. Larry Page on Monday dethroned Oracle's Larry Ellison to snatch the position, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Shares of Alphabet climbed 6.31% on Monday at close after a report said Facebook-parent Meta Platforms was in discussions to use Google's AI chips in its data centers from 2027 and rent chips from Google Cloud by next year. Alphabet stock price today continued its rally to touch an all-time high at premarket trading on Tuesday, rising over 3%. As per Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, the net worth of Larry Page stood at $267.5 billion on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison of Oracle slipped to the No.3 position with a net worth of $250.5 billion. Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world, with his net worth hitting a massive $473.2 billion. On Monday alone, Larry Page's net worth climbed by $8.7 billion as per Forbes, thanks to the rally in Alphabet shares. The rally in Page's personal wealth over the past five years is impressive too, going from $50.9 billion in 2020 to $144 billion at the beginning of 2025. By the years end, he touched the quarter-trillion dollar mark. Larry Page is the co-founder of Google, one of the world's most recognised and valuable companies. Page founded the company with Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998, and used to be the CEO of Alphabet — the parent company of Google. Larry Page vacated the CEO office in 2019 but continued to remain a stakeholder at the company, which explains the meteoric surge in his wealth. At Google, he was the CEO till 2001. Shares of Google parent Alphabet have rallied almost 70% this year, outperforming other megacaps and bringing it close to the prized $4 trillion market capitalisation. Alphabet climbed 3.7% in premarket trading, bringing the search giant closer to a $4 trillion valuation. The rally came after the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions of dollars on the search giant’s artificial intelligence chips. Meta is in discussions to use the chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, according to the Information, which cited an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Apple Reportedly Cuts Dozens of Jobs Across Its Sales Division

Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Apple Reportedly Cuts Dozens of Jobs Across Its Sales Division

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. Apple is reportedly cutting dozens of sales jobs to eliminate redundancy, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the development. While the exact number of jobs eliminated is unclear, affected employees were notified in the last couple of weeks. Unlike layoffs at other tech giants, those at Apple have until Jan. 20 to find a new position within the company or leave with a severance package, the report adds. Since Apple's primary goal is reportedly to improve the way it presents its products to businesses, schools, and governments, eliminated roles include account managers serving these institutions, as well as employees who manage product demos and briefing centers for them. "To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles," an Apple spokesperson tells Bloomberg. "We are continuing to hire, and those employees can apply for new roles." One of the hardest-hit teams worked with the US Defense and Justice Departments, Bloomberg reports. They were already facing a tough time with the recent government shutdown and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) spending cutbacks before that. Several weeks ago, the iPhone maker also cut 20 sales jobs in Australia and New Zealand. Sources tell Bloomberg that some of the laid-off workers claim the company is just trying to offload its sales responsibilities to third-party resellers. Meanwhile, multiple tech behemoths have announced mass layoffs lately. Verizon laid off over 13,000 workers last week; Amazon confirmed 14,000 job cuts late last month; and Intel announced plans to reduce its headcount by 15% in June.

Title: Nvidia Shares Fall Sharply Amid Talks Of Meta Mulling Use Of Google Chips

Shares of Nvidia Corp. plunged nearly 7% during early trade on Tuesday following reports that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is considering using chips designed by Google. The slide put the stock on track for its biggest monthly decline since the market rout of 2022. The share price has fallen about 15% month to date. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. gained as much as 2.6% higher, after a more than 6% rally on Monday. The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. The company released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, this month. A Google-Meta deal would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia's chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms. Graphics processing units (GPUs), dominated by Nvidia, were initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, particularly for video games and visual effects. However, their ability to handle large data sets and computations made them ideal for training AI models. In contrast, TPUs are specialised microchips, known as application-specific integrated circuits, designed specifically for a particular purpose. Last month, Google signed a deal with Anthropic PBC to supply up to 1 million of its specialised AI chips in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. Meta's capex of at least $100 billion for 2026 suggests it will spend at least $40-$50 billion on inferencing-chip capacity next year, as per a Bloomberg report.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Ondo Finance Puts $25M Into YLDS Tokenized Fund

Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:50:53Z

Quick Facts: Ondo Finance just injected $25M into YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund. YLDS will join an exclusivist portfolio which also includes assets from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. It’s a textbook signal that serious capital is leaning further into tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and crypto-backed lending as a core part of modern market infrastructure. The winners are likely to be the tools and tokens that sit directly on those flows. So, as interest for RWAs grows, the best crypto to buy next focuses less on hype and more on who is building the plumbing. With that lens, three projects stand out in the current market: Best Wallet Token ($BEST) as a next-gen wallet layer onboarding everyday users, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI-plus-Web3 content economy play, and XRP ($XRP) as the institutional cross-border backbone to fuel efficient crypto transfers. As tokenized treasuries, yield-bearing stablecoins, and onchain credit markets expand, the bottleneck is no longer just liquidity – it’s UX and security. Best Wallet steps in to solve this issue with a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. The $BEST token provides in-app utility for holders using this wallet layer. For example, $BEST unlocks first-stage presale access in the Upcoming Tokens portal. Here, early buyers can check vetted presales with a simplified purchase flow, effectively turning the wallet into a vetted deal-launchpad for emerging opportunities. Economically, the presale has already raised over $17.4M with $BEST sitting at $0.025995, signaling meaningful traction at seed-stage valuations. Based on Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at $0.072 by the end of 2025. That makes up for a 175% ROI potential for EOY investment. In a favorable market context, the numbers can go higher, especially if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. Note that the presale only has three days left, so slots are running out. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. While DeFi chases yields, the $85B content-creation industry is quietly shifting toward models where creators actually own their output and audience data. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) targets that gap by merging Web3 payments with AI-native tools, giving creators both lower platform fees and more control over monetization. The presale has already raised over $1.3M+ at a token price of $0.057025, suggesting early conviction in the thesis that creators will follow better economics. Given that the project is planning to onboard the top 2,000+ highest-earning creators, we expect SUBBD to see massive post-launch adoption. From a growth-sector perspective, SUBBD is a leveraged bet on AI + creator monetization rather than just number-go-up memetics. As onchain finance broadens, attention remains the most scarce resource – SUBBD is building rails to tokenize it. Buy $SUBBD from the official presale today. On the institutional side of this market shift, XRP ($XRP) sits in a privileged position. XRP is designed specifically for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning for financial institutions, settling transactions on the XRP Ledger in around 3-5 seconds with minimal fees suitable for high-volume flows. $XRP is also a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap and a leading asset in the blockchain-based payments sector, making it a more mature, lower-volatility way to express a view on the continued growth of onchain settlement rails. The project’s profile lines up directly with the kind of tokenized treasuries and yield-bearing stablecoin activity Ondo’s move highlights. As more traditional finance players look for instant, global settlement of tokenized assets, they need enterprise-grade infrastructure, which Ripple has spent years building – from compliance tooling to bank integrations and payment corridors. In November 2025, Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation to expand institutional XRP use and deepen its footprint in payments. Find $XRP on Binance today. This is not financial advice.

Title: AMD rumored to hike price of GPUs by 10% – so it could be a case of grab a Black Friday deal now, or feel the pain later

Buy now or regret it? Rumors of price hikes are mounting up… When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you're thinking about buying a graphics card, there have been further whispers from the grapevine that price hikes could be coming due to the spiking cost of video memory – meaning Black Friday may be the best chance to get a good deal on a new GPU for some time. TechPowerUp highlighted (via VideoCardz) that analyst Dan Nystedt on X flagged a (paywalled) report from UDN, which claims AMD has told its graphics card-making partners that prices are set to rise. AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025 The article suggests that AMD is hiking prices by 10% across its entire Radeon product line due to the rising cost of video RAM (VRAM) modules. Obviously, take that with a whole heap of seasoning, but we have seen multiple reports in recent times about the rising cost of memory – for RAM chips and storage alike – being a very real phenomenon. So, it seems like the situation is worsening for graphics cards when it comes to VRAM, at least on AMD's side. GPUs use VRAM to speed up their performance – it's much quicker than relying on the PC's system memory, as VRAM is right there, on the board, and swift to access – and some graphics cards pile a lot of the stuff on. When AMD sells graphics chips to a board-making partner, the practice is to bundle the video RAM modules with it – these are the two main components in a graphics card, of course. With the cost of RAM increasing by a considerable amount, the price of those bundles is increasing, with AMD charging its partners more. Of course, that cost won't be absorbed by the card maker, but will be passed on to the consumer who's buying the product. Therefore, Radeon GPUs are likely to get around 10% pricier on the shelves as the impact of this filters through the supply and production chain, but obviously, as noted, we need to be careful around rumors and a single report – it might be untrue. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That said, given a lot of recent speculation about how GPU prices might rise, the evidence is mounting, and there's an increasing feeling that if you do want to buy a graphics card in the near – or even middle-term – future, Black Friday could offer the best prices for quite some time. (There's a tempting Sapphire RX 9060 XT deal on the boil for one thing). And if you're thinking that price hikes might apply more to high-end graphics cards with lots of VRAM, think again – this will hit more affordable GPUs just as much. Indeed, there's even been a suggestion that some cheaper (mid-range) graphics cards are going to be canned, as those models that pack more VRAM relative to their price bracket (principally more affordable 16GB offerings) are set for disproportionate cost increases – hikes that may not make much sense for the product. I'd take that with even more seasoning, and the same holds true for the rumors about Nvidia delaying RTX 5000 Super refreshes due to VRAM supply issues. But still, all this very much adds to the general vibe of buying now rather than waiting, which is currently gripping the GPU market. ➡️ Read our full guide to the best graphics card1.

Title: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-21shares-crypto-custody-shift
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:37:56Z
Full Content:
Standard Chartered will provide digital asset custody for 21Shares, signaling deeper expansion into crypto by traditional financial players. Update (Nov. 26, 2025, at 8:30 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares and Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody. Major bank Standard Chartered announced fund manager 21Shares has selected it as its digital asset custodian, potentially moving away from a crypto-native partner. According to a Monday announcement from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph, the bank will provide crypto custody services to 21Shares, which offers multiple exchange-traded crypto products. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank’s global head of financing and securities services, said the collaboration allows them to “to extend our expertise into the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem.” However, 21Shares already had a crypto-native custody partner. In late June 2024, the fund manager partnered with crypto-native custodian Zodia Custody to hold its assets. Zodia Custody was co-founded by Standard Chartered in 2020 and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, indicating that the bank wanted to avoid direct involvement in crypto at the time. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, said that the company views Standard Chartered’s appointment “as a positive sign of the industry’s continued maturity.” He also explained that “Standard Chartered’s custody offering employs Zodia Custody’s underlying technology and risk frameworks.” The move comes as more traditional financial institutions roll out crypto services, often with reputational advantages over crypto-native competitors. Still, Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that this is not a shift from existing partners. Instead, “adding Standard Chartered simply expands our multi-custodian model.” He said: Byas-Perry also said that “21Shares continues to work with leading crypto-native custodians.” He explained that the fund manager chose Standard Chartered “because of their global reputation, regulatory footprint, and risk-management standards” and added: Byas-Perry explained that “some institutions prefer working with names they already know, while others rely on crypto-native specialists.” Still, he believes that 21Shares’ “job is to support both.” Standard Chartered had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication. Related: BlackRock quietly accumulated 3% of all Bitcoin. Here’s what that means Standard Chartered said 21Shares will work with its newly established digital asset custody service based in Luxembourg. The announcement follows the bank’s mid-July launch of a trading service that allows institutions and corporations to trade major cryptocurrencies. 21Shares’ global head of product development, Mandy Chiu, said the collaboration is “an important milestone in our continued mission to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem.” She pointed to the bank’s reputation in traditional finance as an advantage. Other major banks have taken similar steps. In September, US multinational financial services firm US Bancorp reentered the crypto space by relaunching its digital asset custody services aimed explicitly at investment managers. This follows the company’s launch of its custody service in 2021, which was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable regulations. Mid-August reports also note that Wall Street giant Citigroup is weighing plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and payment services. In July, Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, was also reported to be planning to allow its clients to store cryptocurrencies — amid a broader trend in the nation. Related: US Federal agencies outline key risks for banks eyeing crypto custody That trend has stirred debate within the industry, as crypto-native institutions face intense competition. In October, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at crypto financial services platform Uphold, said that large Bitcoin (BTC) wallets moving their assets into ETFs is “another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit.” The comment follows Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, saying that the company had already facilitated more than $3 billion worth of real Bitcoin to ETF conversions. He added that holders recognize “the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: BlackRock’s $400 Million Bitcoin Move Sparks Liquidity Alarm | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as markets enter an unusual phase where large players are repositioning and liquidity is tightening. Against this backdrop, the timing of one major transfer has raised fresh questions about what might be coming next for Bitcoin. BlackRock quietly moved 4,471 BTC to Coinbase Prime, hours before the PPI report. The move comes as its flagship Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, logged record monthly outflows. BlackRock just deposited another 4,471 $BTC($390.8M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/3CqgyHozVC The timing has ignited a new debate: Is the world’s biggest asset manager preparing for a deeper US liquidity shock? Arkham data shows the same wallet has fallen from a $117 billion peak to $78.4 billion, losing more than 30% of its value over the past month. The transfer occurs at a time of increasing stress across Bitcoin markets, with analysts like Crypto Rover noting that BlackRock’s move could exacerbate selling. Meanwhile, the timing ahead of the US PPI has also raised concern. Meanwhile,VanEck’s Matthew Sigel sees the Bitcoin price’s ongoing struggle as primarily a macro dynamic, calling it an “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon. “…The driver: tightening US liquidity and widening credit spreads as AI-capex fears collided with a more fragile funding market,” he stated. This aligns with recent stress across equities, credit, and rate-sensitive assets. Traders are watching whether the November PPI print, due just after the BTC transfer, signals further tightening. However, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood argues the current liquidity pressure is temporary. “The liquidity squeeze that has hit AI and crypto will reverse in the next few weeks,” she said. The Ark Invest executive cited a 123% surge in Palantir’s US commercial business, calling it evidence that enterprise adoption is accelerating despite macro headwinds. The blockchain activity comes as BlackRock’s IBIT posts its worst outflow month on record, over $2 billion this month. Analysts highlight it as the biggest withdrawal wave since launch. “…After months of steady inflows, the outflows reflect rising caution as Bitcoin falls ~22% over the past month and 7% year-to-date,” wrote Walter Bloomberg. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pushed back on the panic, stressing that context is being lost. According to the analyst, the majority of investors are sticking around despite the outflows. That’s bc it never had outflows bf! All told the “record” is 3% of aum. The real story (that you def won’t see in ALL CAPS let alone in the media at large) is 97% of investors are sticking around despite not starting the -35% fire. https://t.co/2p0c5gJIji He also highlighted the collapse in short interest, ascribing plummeting IBIT short interest to traders who tend to short into strength and cover in downturns.

Title: Private Assets to Be Half of Industry Revenues by 2030, PwC Says

The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, PwC found. November 25, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Private markets will generate more than half of the money-management industry’s revenues by 2030, an increase that reflects the intensifying competition among firms to expand in private debt and equity and infrastructure, according to PwC. “The winners won’t be those who gather the most assets, but those who rewire the fastest,” Albertha Charles, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC UK, said Monday in a report that surveyed 300 global firms and investors. The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, exceeding the totals for traditional actively managed investments and for passive products, the consultancy found. In 2024, private assets accounted for 44% of total revenue, with traditional investments making up most of the industry total, according to PwC. Still, private markets have become increasingly crowded. Many traditional fund houses — including Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd. and State Street Corp. — have acquired or partnered with private-markets firms recently to gain a foothold. BlackRock Inc. has spent more than $25 billion since the start of 2024 to grow in private credit and infrastructure and compete with the likes of Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc. and Ares Management Corp. Related:Rowan Says People ‘Lost Their Minds’ Over Private Credit Fears The asset management industry is also facing unrelenting fee pressure on traditional stock, bond, money-market and multi-asset funds, with almost 60% of institutional investors surveyed by PwC saying they’re likely or very likely to replace a manager solely for cost reasons. As a result, fees are expected to decline across active and passive strategies, even while costs remain stubbornly high. “Traditional cost-cutting has barely made a dent,” PwC said. “Diversifying into new asset classes and expanding into new markets add cost and complexity.” Fast forward five years, though, and technology will help drive profits in an industry with ever-narrowing margins, according to PwC. “Asset managers see AI integration and automation as the most important actions they’re taking today to transform and future-proof their business models for 2030,” the firm said in the report.

November 25, 2025 09:12 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.This report provides an overview of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation in the financial services industry. It examines the forecasted size of the AI market, delving into specific types of AI spend (such as generative AI, computer vision, and agentic AI). The report lists different ways of utilizing AI to combat fraud, cyberattacks, evolving regulation, bad user experience, growing volumes of transactional data, and new attack vectors. It provides new case studies of innovative uses of AI within the industry, while providing company profiles of the leading AI adopters and specialist vendors across the insurance, banking, payments, and wealth management industries.AI adoption in financial services has ramped up significantly in the last few years. Financial services firms have long adopted generative AI tools for customer service and improved decision making, yet sustained direct profitability remains far off. The recent boom of agentic AI investment has necessitated financial services companies to reconsider all of their AI pilots, to govern deployments like product launches: require return on investment gates, scale what demonstrably pays, and sunset what does not. Financial services firms must adopt AI to improve cybersecurity and fraud prevention in the face of adaptive cyberattacks, new attack vectors, and rising insider threats.Report Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: 1.

Title: BitMine Bags 70K ETH As PEPENODE Mining Meme Coin Nears $2.2M in Viral Presale

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Ethereum treasuries are back in the spotlight. BitMine Immersion Technology just snapped up another 69,822 $ETH in a single week, lifting its stash to 3.63M $ETH (roughly 3% of the entire circulating supply), and boosting combined crypto and cash holdings to $11.2B. The timing is spicy. $ETH has dropped close to 30% over the past month, dragging the value of BitMine’s treasury down from over $12B to near $10–11B before the latest rebound. Yet BitMine keeps buying, effectively doubling down on an ‘own the network’ thesis while its stock trades under pressure like other crypto-treasury plays. It’s the same tension playing out in Bitcoin land. Large $BTC treasuries have seen their market caps slump relative to the value of the coins they hold. And yet, while some $BTC has bled off, the drumbeat of acquisitions continues. This ongoing trend generates a weird split: corporate balance sheets hoarding blue-chip crypto, public equity multiples compressing, and retail investors left wondering whether to buy the coins, the stocks, or something else entirely. That’s where high-yield narratives like PEPENODE start to look interesting, particularly for meme coin hunting retail traders. Instead of owning a listed treasury at a discount, you effectively buy into a mine-to-earn meme ecosystem with direct token exposure, aggressive staking yields, and gamified virtual mining mechanics. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is built as a mine-to-earn meme coin on Ethereum, but it doesn’t ask anyone to plug in an ASIC. Instead, the project unveils a fully virtual mining simulator where holders use $PEPENODE tokens to buy miner nodes and upgrade digital facilities. Here, you’re building out customizable server rooms that generate simulated hashpower and rewards inside a web app dashboard. The idea is simple but clever; virtual mining rewards put in a meme coin wrapper and accessible from any basic Ethereum wallet. No rigs, no cooling fans, no angry landlord. PEPENODE also leans into the meme economy. The roadmap includes rewards not only in $PEPENODE itself but also in some of the best meme coins like $PEPE and other community favorites. These rewards will go to the top leaderboard players once the full game is live. On top of the gameplay, the presale already offers staking, not at a whopping 589% rewards for early participants, with emissions distributed over two years. It fits the project’s pitch: reward early backers aggressively while the mine-to-earn ecosystem spins up. For anyone watching BitMine push toward a validator-heavy future with its planned US-based staking network, PEPENODE feels like the retail, gamified interpretation of the same meta, just with memes, frogs, and a leaderboard instead of a Nasdaq ticker. Check PEPENODE’s official website for more. While treasuries like BitMine and the big Bitcoin holders wrestle with stock prices that occasionally drift below the value of their underlying crypto, $PEPENODE is still in pure token-issuance mode. That puts new buyers roughly in line with recent analyst models. Our $PEPENODE token forecast sees a potential high of $0.0077 for 2026 if the mine-to-earn game launches on schedule, exchange listings land, and crypto sentiment stays constructive. From today’s presale price, that implies a theoretical upside of roughly ~560% into 2026 under optimistic conditions. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE to join now. Instead of paying a premium or small discount for a listed treasury stock, whose upside is tied to multiples and macro flows, you’re taking on a high-risk, high-reward crypto with high-APR staking, decent upside potential, and optional exposure to multiple meme assets via the virtual mining rewards. Instead of just parking tokens and waiting for TGE, early buyers can stake immediately, then later deploy those same tokens into nodes and upgrades once Phase 3 of the roadmap kicks in. The result is a presale that behaves less like a static raise and more like a soft launch of the game economy. Explore the PEPENODE presale while early. This is not financial advice. Crypto and presale investments are highly volatile; never risk capital you cannot afford to lose.

Title: 'Shocked, stunned' - locals gather for Gallagher funeral

The funeral mass of a 59-year-old woman who died after an attack near her home in Ballinlough in Cork city earlier this month has heard that she brought "goodness and beauty to this world". Family, friends and members of the local community gathered at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough today for the funeral mass of Stella Gallagher. Her husband Brian Gallagher, who was also injured in the attack, was at the mass along with the couple's adult children Ciara, Conor and Mark. Brian Gallagher was among the pallbearers who carried the coffin out of the church at the conclusion of the service for burial at St Michael's cemetery in nearby Blackrock. Alan Gallagher, a brother-in-law of Stella Gallagher, said a few words on behalf of his brother Brian during the requiem mass. Mr Gallagher said Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family. "When I asked them what some of their good memories of Stella were, they looked back at me and said they were all good. She was a joy to be around and great fun. She was game for anything and would go anywhere and have a good time." Mr Gallagher emphasised that Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them. "Whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip." Mr Gallagher also recalled the activities that made Stella "really light up with joy" including singing, gardening and baking. "We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will." Mr Gallagher closed his eulogy with a few lines by American short story writer Raymond Carver. "And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the Earth." Meanwhile, Monsignor Gearóid Dullea, co-parish priest in Ballinlough, told mourners that the death of Stella had left her loved ones "broken hearted" and "bewildered". He stated that her "shocking death" had brought a "great pall of sadness" not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families but also on the wider community. "Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle, her friends and the Togher Community Garden and her fellow singers in the SHEP choir. Stella’s death has shocked us, stunned us and shaken us. "Stella was deeply loved as wife, as mother, as sister, as daughter-in-law, as sister-in-law, as aunt, as cousin, as friend. She was a positive person, often humming a song, with a quiet religious faith," he said. Offertory gifts included apples representing Stella’s love of gardening, sourdough signifying her enjoyment of baking, sheet music arising of her fondness for music and a gift box symbolising her generous and giving nature. Monsignor Dullea celebrated the mass alongside Fr Gerard Dunne and Rev Alan Marley, both of whom were representing University College Cork. Taoiseach Micheál Martin was represented by his Aide de Camp, Commandant Joe Glennon. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Share this article Alphabet stock (GOOG) surged around 4% in premarket trading on Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped 3% following a report that Meta may tap Google’s AI hardware. According to The Information, Mark Zuckerberg’s company is exploring a multiyear purchase of Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) in a bid to diversify its AI hardware supply and reduce its reliance on Nvidia. The talks reportedly include renting TPUs as early as next year and deploying them more broadly by 2027. The news pushed Alphabet shares higher overnight, extending Monday’s 6% rally. According to Yahoo Finance, the stock reached a fresh all-time high and is on track to reach $4 trillion in market capitalization. Alphabet’s performance has been strong throughout the month, with shares up around 22%, boosted in part by Berkshire Hathaway’s investment. Warren Buffett’s company acquired 17.8 million Alphabet shares, worth approximately $4.3 billion, in the third quarter of 2025, its first major move into a leading Big Tech name.

Title: Can artificial Christmas tree companies spruce things up for next year?
URL: https://www.retaildive.com/news/holiday-shopper-tariffs-artificial-christmas-trees-retail/806082/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T12:00:00Z

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. No one wants to put tariffs on Christmas, says the National Tree Company CEO. But what happens when all of your raw materials are made outside of the U.S.? If you celebrate Christmas, there’s a good chance you are putting up a tree this year. There’s also a high probability that you are rockin’ around a fake tree. Convenience, safety, durability and cost-effectiveness contribute to 83% of households selecting an artificial tree for the season, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. And the U.S., as it turns out, has a much heavier artificial tree representation than most of the world. “About 15 to 20 million are bought every single year,” National Tree Company CEO Chris Butler said. “It’s a huge industry.” This segment of the holiday market has been impacted by a year of roller coaster tariffs, retail pullback and an uncertain consumer base. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about, ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas,’” Butler said. But, as he points out, “Zero percent of our industry is made in the U.S.” Holiday-focused companies are responding by moving production to different countries, implementing price changes, conducting promotions when possible and advocating to the government. Not just for 2025, but for Christmas seasons yet to come. The National Tree Company knows trees. Specifically, artificial ones. As one of the largest domestic wholesalers of the product, shoppers can buy directly from the company’s website, but also through large retailers including Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Macy’s and Lowe’s. As far as artificial tree consumption goes, the U.S. sports an average of one and a half trees per household, with the average purchase cycle being between five and six years. And all of the raw materials to make those trees come from China. The National Tree Company started to move its production out of China about 18 months ago for diversity and flexibility of its supply chain. The company currently sources from parts of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Vietnam, resulting in around 60% of its goods coming from outside of China this year. “When the tariffs came out, no one was thinking about ‘Let’s put tariffs on Christmas.’” Chris Butler CEO, National Tree Company So when tariffs were announced this spring, the company was expecting it, but they weren’t expecting the tariffs to be so heavy on countries other than China. “It was a bit of a shock to the system all the way around, because we were looking at 50% tariffs across the board, pretty much going from zero,” Butler said. When tariffs on China reached 145% this spring, almost all artificial tree production across this segment of the industry stopped for about 30 days. When levies on China were reduced, production started up again, but at a lower rate, Butler said. Additionally, many companies started building their supply chain sites outside of China at the same time. “It’s not difficult to set up a new factory in different countries, but once you do that, you still need the raw materials from China,” Butler said. “There was a slowing down of the supply chain this year, and hence why we think there’ll be somewhat of a shortage of supply.” The National Tree Company was able to be flexible when tariffs went back to 30%, in part because the business had been steadily investing in its supply chain systems. Even still, it was “100% by far the most challenging year ever,” Butler said. There may be better news going into 2026, however, when it comes to supply chains and tariffs. “I think it will start to stabilize,” Lauren Beitelspacher, professor of marketing at Babson College, said in emailed comments. Yet, “retail is always fraught with disruption,” Beitelspacher said. “The ups and downs are normal.” The big unknown for specialty retailers and big-box stores alike this year has been consumer sentiment. Tariffs, inflation, layoffs and a sudden suspension of SNAP funding have all contributed to an unsteady foundation for many holiday shoppers. Stores weren’t exactly sure how to gauge inventory for the season. Over half of holiday orders were placed by the end of May, about two months earlier when compared to 2024, according to Deloitte’s 2025 Retail Holiday Buyer Survey. Retail buyers paused shipments of some orders due to the trade environment or even canceled orders they determined would be unprofitable. The National Tree Company saw retailers “fall back somewhat because they were unsure of the consumer demand and consumer sentiment for this holiday season,” Butler said. Holiday shortages loomed over this Christmas season even as early as July, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. A 90-day reprieve in tariffs during the summer didn’t solve problems, according to the nonprofit group, because most Christmas decor items, including trees, lights, ornaments and garlands, are manufactured overseas with long production lead times. Now that retailers are in the throes of the season, some shoppers are pulling back on purchasing those exact items. Nearly 30% of people in the U.S. are decreasing their decorating budgets this year, according to a survey from Rocket Mortgage and Redfin. More than half (56%) of the segment that is pulling back say it is because they are trying to save money, while 44% named economic uncertainty as the reason behind the change. But there are still deals out there to be had. “If you’re in the market for a tree, buy now, buy early, buy multiple,” Butler said. “Despite the price increase from the tariffs, there are absolutely going to be deals. Because us — as well as everybody else — is seeing softness in demand. So there’s definitely going to be deals.” Butler also leads the Christmas Trade Group, a 10-member organization that collectively brings in over $1 billion annually and represents over 1,000 employees. He recently was in Washington, D.C., meeting with the Senate Finance Committee as a way to provide education on their businesses and garner insights into tariffs going forward. “2025 is done,” Butler said. “So what we’re trying to do is ‘save Christmas’ for 2026. Both from a supply chain perspective, in terms of securing supply in the right areas, as well as from a cost perspective, to keep the costs lower.” “We want to maintain the affordability of the holiday,” he said.

Title: Novo Nordisk phase 2 trial with amycretin reports significant weight loss and HbA1c reduction in type 2 diabetes

November 25, 2025 06:24 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 25 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced positive headline results from a phase 2 clinical trial with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes. This marks the first evaluation of amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes, further demonstrating Novo Nordisk’s commitment to advancing innovation in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is a unimolecular agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and amylin receptors, intended for once-weekly subcutaneous administration and once-daily oral administration. The trial investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin and once-daily oral amycretin compared to placebo in 448 people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor as standard of care. Approximately 40% of all participants were using an SGLT2 inhibitor before initiating the trial. The trial was a combined multiple ascending dose study, investigating six subcutaneous doses from 0.4 mg to 40 mg administered weekly, and three daily oral doses of 6 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg, with a total treatment duration of up to 36 weeks. When evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment1 from a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.8%, once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin achieved dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c of up to -1.8% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving HbA1c <7% and ≤6.5% was up to 89.1% and 76.2% respectively. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%, people treated with once-daily oral amycretin achieved dose-dependent improvements in HbA1c of up to -1.5% by week 36. The proportion of people achieving an HbA1c level of <7% and ≤6.5% with once-daily oral amycretin was 77.6% and 62.6% respectively. By comparison, people treated with placebo achieved HbA1c improvement of -0.2% and -0.4% with subcutaneous and oral amycretin, respectively. The estimated improvements in HbA1c were all statistically significant versus placebo, confirming the primary endpoints of the trial. From a mean baseline body weight of 99.2 kg, subcutaneous amycretin achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -14.5% compared to -2.6% in people treated with placebo. People treated with the highest dose of subcutaneous amycretin were on the final maintenance dose for a duration of 4 weeks. Similarly, from a mean baseline body weight of 101.1 kg, people treated with oral amycretin also achieved statistically significant weight loss of up to -10.1% compared to -2.5% in people treated with placebo. For the higher doses of amycretin, irrespective of administration route, no weight loss plateau was observed at week 36. In the trial, subcutaneous and oral amycretin appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile, consistent with other incretin and amylin-based therapies. The most common adverse events with amycretin were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate in severity. “We are very encouraged by the phase 2 data with amycretin in people with type 2 diabetes - the first time amycretin has been evaluated in this population. The data further validate the potential best-in-class profile of amycretin” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “Amycretin is built on the complementary biology of GLP-1 and amylin, and we are looking forward to bringing amycretin into an extensive phase 3 development programme across multiple indications in 2026”. Based on the results, Novo Nordisk is now planning to initiate a phase 3 development programme with amycretin for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2026. About amycretinAmycretin is a unimolecular, long-acting GLP-1 and amylin receptor agonist under development by Novo Nordisk to provide an efficacious and convenient treatment for adults with overweight or obesity and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. Amycretin is developed for oral and subcutaneous administration. About the Phase 2 trial in T2DThis trial is an interventional, multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel, double-blind (within arms), placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. The phase 2 trial investigated the safety, efficacy and PK properties of once-weekly subcutaneous and once-daily oral amycretin in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.0-10.0 %) on a stable dose of metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor. In the trial, close to two-thirds of the participants were male across both routes of administration. The trial consisted of nine active treatment arms. Participants received increasing doses of once-weekly subcutaneous amycretin (0.4 mg, 1.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) in six groups, and oral amycretin (6 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) in three groups for up to 36 weeks. The primary objective is to determine and characterise the dose-response relationship of subcutaneous and oral amycretin on change in HbA1c from baseline to week 36 in participants with type 2 diabetes. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight (%) from baseline to week 36. About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

Title: Amazon CTO Werner Vogels just released his 2026 tech predictions. He’s most optimistic about ‘personalized learning’ and ‘renaissance developers’

Good morning. Several years ago, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels began sharing predictions on how technology would likely impact our lives the following year. In the past, he has foreseen the impact of digital technology in sports, AI assistants in developer productivity, machine learning embedded in production lines, and ‘fem tech’ in women’s health. As CTO since 2005, he occupies a unique perch to see—and even shape—what’s next. He also has a vested interest, of course, in embracing the technologies that his company creates. But these predictions are worth taking note of as these trends—if they materialize—will affect wide swaths of the economy. So what’s he forecasting for 2026? I spoke with Vogels about the thinking behind this year’s predictions. Among other things, he admits that technology tools from AI to military drones can obviously harm or help, depending on the intention of the user. But he’s an optimist, especially about the potential for personalized learning and software developers. And how does he see the mission of the CTO—a role that can cover everything from being the person who manages data centers to the founder focused on product? “I actually think CTOs are horrible managers. You should never put a CTO in charge of people,” he argues. “VPs of engineering wake up in the morning, thinking ‘Do I have the best team in the best situation? Can I shield them from politics and stuff like that?’ The CTO thinks about, ‘What’s the next technology that we should be building?’ Actually, that was my role for many years within Amazon. Then you become a technology provider, and then your role changes again. You have to understand how your customers are actually using your technology.” As for what excites him most: “Especially in Africa, I’ve met so many motivated engineers that don’t want to come to the U.S. They don’t want to go work for a large company. They want to solve the problem in their country. I love that. That’s where the real progress lies.” Click here for our full interview.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Google challenges Nvidia’s chips Shares of Nvidia dropped following a report that Meta is in talks to buy billions worth of AI chips from Google, suggesting the search engine company’s chips are ready to compete with Nvidia’s bestselling versions.

Tim Cook’s possible successors Since Apple CEO Tim Cook turned 65 recently , speculation has intensified about his possible successors. John Ternus, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue and Greg ‘Joz’ Joswiak are all reportedly in the running and oversee different parts of the company. The Big Short investor compares Nvidia with Cisco The Big Short investor Michael Burry wrote in his first Substack post that Nvidia is the equivalent of Cisco during the dot com bubble: significantly overvalued and a harbinger for when the AI bubble will pop. Novo Nordisk’s slump continues U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk fell more than 5% on Monday, largely due to the drug developer’s announcement that semaglutide, the core ingredient in its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, did not slow cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s patients. The company has lost almost half of its value since the year started. Is robot-driven unemployment already here? Amazon cut 14,000 jobs in October, and multiple sources now predict another round of layoffs in early 2026 as the company doubles down on AI and robotics. Both blue-collar and white-collar employees are growing anxious about who might be next—and what the future looks like if there aren’t enough jobs left for humans.

Title: India shouldn’t build AI models: The prize lies in using what exists to innovate and generate value

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that it was eliminating 14,000 management positions because artificial intelligence (AI) tools had rendered those middle-management roles redundant. Amazon isn’t the only one—Microsoft, Google and IBM have all announced AI-related layoffs. According to a 2023 report by Niti Aayog, 1.5 million Indian jobs in the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors alone are expected to be at high risk by 2031. McKinsey believes that as many as 69% of tasks in India’s IT services industry can already be automated with existing AI technology, suggesting that as many as 3-4 million jobs in the IT and BPO sectors could be at risk in the near to medium term. Our instinctive response has been to try to catch up—to build AI capabilities so that we can replace the jobs being lost by upskilling displaced workers with the technology that displaced them. We have announced AI education initiatives, established new AI research centres and funded GPU clusters and data centres that we believe these newly trained engineers will be able to use for building AI applications. But this strategy is unlikely to be effective. Firstly, India will not be able to bridge the skills gap by simply retraining its existing workforce. Unlike the IT industry, which has a broad base, AI has an inverted pyramid and is staffed in exactly the opposite way that a BPO centre is staffed. As a result, even if we manage to reskill all those in the traditional IT industry, only a small fraction of those reskilled IT workers will be needed going forward. What’s more, unlike the US, which boasts of 30 years of AI research infrastructure and top universities that attract global talent, and China, which is investing billions in AI research and already has a massive pool of strong STEM graduates, India currently produces fewer than 500 AI PhDs annually. Even if we increase this 10-fold, we will still be playing catch-up in a field where first-mover advantages matter enormously. The trouble with competing in the race to build better AI models is that it requires us to compete upstream in the AI value chain in a market already crowded by players with significantly more capital and hardware infrastructure, which places them ahead in the game. As noble as it might seem for us to fight the good fight, there are other areas in which Indian investments in time and resources are likely to yield better results. When the automobile disrupted traditional urban mobility and transport dynamics, the real opportunity was not in making cars, but in the novel ways in which they could be used for business and the new liberties that arose from being able to use these machines for things that were not possible earlier. When Apple invented the smartphone, it did not just create a revolutionary communication device, but also made it possible for brand new businesses (such as ride-hailing, food delivery and digital payments) to emerge. Every technological transformation creates ripples of opportunity downstream that offer new avenues for entrepreneurship. This suggests that the AI opportunity lies not in competing with big AI labs to build better models, but rather in discovering all the various ways in which AI can be deployed to create value. This, in turn, suggests that instead of competing with countries that are at the cutting edge of developing new foundational AI models, India may be far better off figuring out how to use AI to do things that would not have been possible previously. One of the clearest signs of this downstream potential is how dramatically AI has already lowered barriers to creative endeavours. Already, to write a story or create an image, a musical composition or a software feature, all you need to do is describe what you want and AI will execute it. Even just a few years ago, filmmaking required large crews, expensive equipment and a budget that ran into millions. AI has made it possible to create visual effects, voice actors and music scores, with film editing done and other technical skills deployed at a fraction of that cost. Similarly, music production used to require studio recording, mixing and mastering skills. Today, with AI, almost anyone can generate a score, create vocal effects and mix tracks. Just as the world saw in the case of every other technological transformation that created new jobs and industries downstream of the actual disruption it caused, AI too will birth business opportunities that are not even conceivable today. If we really want to address the disruptions that AI will cause in the job market, we should focus our energies on enabling as many of our people as possible to figure out how to use AI and do all we can to make it possible for our young entrepreneurs to leverage this new technology in as many new and interesting ways as they can imagine. The next three to five years will be a period of intense experimentation, when AI-assisted business models will be tested, refined and scaled. India’s entrepreneurs have a rare early-mover advantage—not in building the models themselves, but in discovering what those models make possible. If we invest our energy downstream, in imagining the new possibilities that are opening up, we will be able to harness the real opportunity that AI offers. Our best response to the AI revolution is not to build better intelligence, but discover the many ways in which it can be put to use. India needs to make the most of this opportunity.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?" Huang said he strongly disapproved. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do." Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday. Have a tip?

Time Published: 2025-11-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
November 25, 2025 05:00 ET | Source: Jiayin Group Inc. Jiayin Group Inc. SHANGHAI, China, Nov. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jiayin Group Inc. (“Jiayin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JFIN), a leading fintech platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Third Quarter 2025 Operational and Financial Highlights: _______________________1 “Loan facilitation volume” refers to the loan facilitation volume facilitated in Chinese Mainland during the period presented.2 “Repeat borrower contribution” for a given period refers to the percentage of loan facilitation volume in Chinese Mainland attributable to repeat borrowers during that period.“Repeat borrowers” during a certain period refers to borrowers who have borrowed in such period and have borrowed at least twice since such borrowers’ registration on our platform until the end of such period.3 “90 day+ delinquency ratio” refers to the outstanding principal balance of loans that were 91 to 180 calendar days past due as a percentage of the total outstanding principal balance of loans facilitated through the Company’s platform as of a specific date. Loans facilitated outside Chinese Mainland are not included in the calculation.4 Please see the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below and the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” set forth at the end of this press release. Mr. Yan Dinggui, the Company’s Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “In the third quarter, we anchored our strategic focus on fortifying operational resilience and advancing prudent risk management. Despite the uncertainty in the macro environment, we reached our previously stated guidance of RMB32.2 billion in loan facilitation volume and RMB490.6 million in Non-GAAP income from operation. We have actively engaged with our financial institution partners to adapt to regulatory changes, while advancing our AI technologies and refining operational work flows, collectively elevating the quality and efficiency of our facilitation services. These efforts lay a robust foundation for sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we remain committed to further consolidating our competitive edge in core domains, ensuring the Company stays at the vanguard of fintech innovation while delivering enduring, stakeholder-centric value.” Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Net revenue was RMB1,470.2 million (US$206.5 million), representing an increase of 1.8% from the same period of 2024. Revenue from loan facilitation services was RMB1,220.7 million (US$171.5 million), representing an increase of 10.4% from the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher loan facilitation volume, partially offset by service fee adjustments. Revenue from releasing of guarantee liabilities was RMB151.8 million (US$21.3 million) compared with RMB251.7 million in the same period of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average outstanding loan balances for which the Company provided guarantee services. Other revenue was RMB97.7 million (US$13.7 million), compared with RMB87.5 million for the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the contribution from referral fees. Facilitation and servicing expense was RMB286.5 million (US$40.2 million) compared with RMB419.1 million for the same period of 2024. This was primarily due to decreased expenses related to financial guarantee services. Allowance for uncollectible receivables, contract assets, loans receivable and others was RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million), representing a decrease of 87.1% from the same period of 2024, primarily due to decreased allowance for oversea loans as a result of disposal of Nigeria entities during 2024 and growth slowdown of receivables from loan facilitation business. Sales and marketing expense was RMB544.2 million (US$76.4 million), representing a decrease of 1.1% from the same period of 2024. General and administrative expense was RMB72.4 million (US$10.2 million), representing an increase of 29.0% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in share-based compensation. Research and development expense was RMB108.7 million (US$15.3 million), representing an increase of 13.3% from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in expenditures for employee compensation and related benefits. Income from operation was RMB456.9 million (US$64.2 million), representing an increase of 46.5% from the same period of 2024. Non-GAAP income from operation was RMB490.6 million (US$68.9 million), compared with RMB326.5 million in the same period of 2024. Net income was RMB376.5 million (US$52.9 million), representing an increase of 39.7% from the same period of 2024.

Title: Gen Z Redefines Work as Flexible Pay Gains Ground

With inflation and changing government policies prompting widespread uncertainty, 6 in 10 American workers are facing pocketbook challenges while lacking the steadiness and predictability of a salaried job.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ The latest installment of PYMNTS Intelligence’s “New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report” series, breaks down how consumers earn income. The study is based on a census-balanced survey of 2,117 U.S. adult consumers, 62% are employed. Among those workers, 43% say their primary source of income is an hourly wage, and another 15% say it is from other non-salaried pay models such as gig work or contract fees. Gen Z workers especially are working outside of fixed-salary roles. Nearly 3 in 4 get their income in other ways, with 51% earning hourly wages, 9% earning contract or consulting fees, 7% earning income from gig or platform work and 5% earning commission-based pay. More Americans are relying on part-time jobs to make ends meet. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employees working full-time dropped by 0.5%, or 695,000 people, between 2023 and 2024. The number of part-time workers jumped 3.7%, or just over 1 million people, during the same period. Relatedly, the rise in gig work can be seen in the expansion of major platforms catering to independent contractors and freelancers. In the third quarter of 2025, Uber said it had 9.4 million drivers, up from 7.8 million the year before and 7.4 million in the second quarter of last year. DoorDash grew total orders by 21% year over year in Q3 to 776 million. Lyft reported record-high gross bookings of $4.8 billion in the third quarter, a 16% year-on-year spike. Even companies outside the dedicated gig platform space, such as UPS, are using the gig model. But as more consumers rely on hourly, project-based and gig work to make ends meet, rather than the stability of a fixed salary, they may find it harder to weather an uncertain economic environment. Because of the Trump administration’s global “reciprocal” tariffs regime, Americans face the highest import levies in 90 years. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Recent PYMNTS data shows confidence slipping, especially among lower-income workers. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, often described as a pessimist, sees the threat of a U.S. recession continuing to loom as the new year approaches. Two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including 42% who see their money fly out the door the month it comes in, an 18% jump since August. It is not as if these workers can simply leave their jobs for more steady, reliable work, with the number of job openings unchanged at 7.2 million in August. What’s more, many of the skilled jobs that often come with fixed salaries are shrinking. While economists are sharply divided over the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs, some recent research suggests that white collar roles — those traditional salaried positions — will be most impacted. While some businesses tout how AI will enable them to introduce operational efficiencies and reduce their workforces, companies also downsize for reasons not related to the technology. October saw a 175% year-over-year increase in layoffs, with Amazon planning to eliminate 30,000 corporate jobs and Target slashing its corporate roles by 1,800. Workers have been nervous about these reductions for some time. A PYMNTS Intelligence survey last year found that 58% of consumers believed generative AI posed a risk to high-skilled jobs in tech. More than half deemed it a risk to mainstream office-based occupations, and 52% said it jeopardized roles for qualified education workers. As go changes in the labor market, so go spending and consumption patterns, deepening the connection between income instability and personal financial well-being.

Unprecedented stress is hitting the US labor market for college graduates, who now represent a record 25.3% of the unemployed. Recent data shows over 1.9 million degree holders are jobless, with their unemployment rate climbing to 2.8%. This surge, particularly impacting younger workers, signals a significant slowdown in white-collar hiring, potentially driven by AI and automation.

Title: Crypto ETF flows: BTC sees $151M outflows as ETH and SOL funds thrive
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-etf-flows-btc-sees-151m-outflows-as-eth-and-sol-funds-thrive/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T07:59:48Z

The cryptocurrency sector remains weak as bearish sentiments prevail. Indeed, recent price drops, muted trading activities, and worries about short-term recoveries have seen many investors adopt a defensive bias. Exchange-traded funds flow data reflects this uncertainty, with Bitcoin recording massive withdrawals as altcoin products hold steady. Let us find out more. BTC spot ETFs had a rough session on Monday, with net outflows totaling $151 million, according to SoSoValue. That signals deteriorated interest in these financial products, which have played a key role in institutional crypto adoption. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out as it posted positive ETF flows of $15.49 million on Monday amidst the broader retreat. On the other hand, BlackRock has struggled lately, with iShares’ outflows surpassing $2.2 billion so far in November. Meanwhile, the mixed ETF outflows come as the Bitcoin price experiences notable downward pressure. The bellwether crypto is trading at $88,190, down from late last month’s high above $115,500. While investors remain more conservative about Bitcoin, Ethereum thrived. Data shows Ether ETFs attracted $96.67 million in inflows yesterday, with BlackRock’s ETHA dominating at $92.61 million. Ethereum seems to thrive as Bitcoin struggles, as narratives like the latest attacks on Strategy by JPMorgan magnified uncertainty in BTC-based financial products. Institutions are seemingly migrating to Ethereum, possibly indicating renewed trust in its unique role in powering scaling solutions, decentralized apps (dApps), and support for new infrastructure. ETH is changing hands at $2,925 after gaining 3% the past 24 hours. It lost more than 2% the past week. Solana held its ground, attracting net inflows of $57.99 million on November 24. The altcoin has seen positive ETF flows since its debut, highlighting steady institutional demand. For instance, Bitwise’s Solana spot exchange-traded fund surpassed $500 million AUM last week. Solana experienced amplified institutional interest due to its robust network that prioritizes scalability, speed, and security. The team spent the past years rewriting Solana’s reputation, darkened by previous network outages. Now, the blockchain exhibits a thriving developer community, booming app usage, and Solana-based tokens. With these factors, Solana has carved a unique lane in the blockchain industry. SOL is trading at $138 after soaring 5% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin lost nearly 30% of its value over the past month. Meanwhile, Solana inflow confirms investors looking beyond price performance while prioritizing long-term potential. Meanwhile, the latest ETF flow statistics highlight a split market. Investors are now exploring crypto offerings beyond Bitcoin. Institutional investors are no longer treating all cryptocurrencies the same. They’re now evaluating every project based on solid catalysts, narratives, and momentum.

Title: What happened to crypto market today – Mild recovery, but where is smart money?

Rebound on bid support, smart money still on the sidelines. Despite a mild rebound, extreme fear shows that broader capital hasn’t entered the crypto market today, keeping smart money cautious. Bullish signs like rising whale holdings and institutional interest in DOGE/XRP ETFs indicate the market still has upside potential. The crypto market today registered a mild rebound. Bitcoin [BTC] retested $88,000, sparking debate over whether it has bottomed or if selling pressure is still weighing on the market. Ethereum [ETH] followed, climbing back above $2,800. All in all, has the market turned bullish? On the macro side, nearly $50 billion flowed into the crypto market over the last 24 hours. Notably, $30 billion of that went straight into Bitcoin. That’s 60% of inflows, a sign that traders are still favoring BTC over altcoins, keeping this cycle BTC-led. The result? The Altcoin Season Index slipped by 3 points to 39. In short, the minor rebound of the crypto market today isn’t broad-based. The inflows seemed to be too concentrated, making it premature to call a market bottom yet, with the TOTAL index already down 0.38% intraday. Source: TradingView (TOTAL/USDT) Simply put, the overall market participation has been cautious. BlackRock, for example, has been selling aggressively, moving 2,822 BTC and 36k ETH into Coinbase Prime. On the ETF side, inflows for both BTC and ETH have been flat, showing that big money isn’t jumping in yet. Reinforcing this, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up just 2 points to 12. However, it’s still in “extreme” fear, matching market positioning, with 95% of 24-hour liquidations in the crypto market today coming from longs. Despite bearish signals though, the crypto market today did see some signs of optimism. On the institutional front, Grayscale’s Dogecoin [DOGE] and Ripple [XRP] ETFs grabbed attention, reinforcing confidence in digital assets. Backing this trend, a prominent analyst challenged the idea of a market top. For one, 560k BTC flowed off CEXs, pushing reserves to an eight-year low. Meanwhile, whales holding over 10k BTC hit a five-month high – A sign that even in a risk-off environment, buying pressure didn’t quite disappear. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In short, the crypto market today jumped on bid support. Alas, with institutional catalysts still missing, inflows concentrated in BTC, fear at extreme levels, and the Altcoin Season Index slipping, broader capital hasn’t entered yet. This is keeping smart money on the sidelines for now. So, while the crypto market today sparked some hope, it’s too early to call a bottom. The bright side – Bullish signals may be still intact, driving the rebound, with a market top nowhere in sight.

Title: TJX Wins Without An RMN; Unlearning To Crawl

The X Factor Big-box department and clothing stores are getting hammered. So why is TJX, the parent company of discount chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, crushing it right now? That’s a question recently mulled by Bloomberg writer Amanda Mull. For one, TJX has a few fortuitous tailwinds. Manufacturers over-acquired raw goods earlier this year to stock up for tariff-related price increases. That’s ideal for TJX, which buys products cheaply when other companies overproduce. But, also, TJX is not a retail media player whatsoever and cares way more about in-store sales than it does about ecommerce. In-person is simply a more exciting shopping experience, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. And that, he said, is something the competition lacks, excitement. Consumers are therefore “very open to trying us,” Herrman said. Other retailers have reshaped their store footprint around ecommerce warehousing and buy-online, pick-up-in-store fulfillment. Stores, in turn, become less appealing, sometimes as a direct result of retail media. Who remembers the Walgreens-Cooler-Screens fiasco? Don’t Crawl On Me Two roads diverged in a yellow wood: One leads to a partnership with OpenAI, the other to blocking OpenAI’s bots. In contrast to Walmart’s headfirst dive into agentic shopping, Amazon recently updated its robots.txt file to block more OpenAI bots from crawling its site, Modern Retail reports. ChatGPT has been providing more referral traffic for some retailers, like Walmart and Target, but Amazon prefers shoppers to purchase from it directly, rather than via ChatGPT. A primary incentive? Ads, of course. Amazon’s advertising business generates roughly $56 billion a year, according to Modern Retail, and depends on shoppers browsing its site. (People can bypass ads when they’re shopping via ChatGPT.) And so, for now, Amazon has been leaning into its own agentic shopping tools instead. Still, Amazon hasn’t fully ruled out future partnerships with third-party agents. During the company’s most recent earnings call in late October, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to “find ways to partner” with these companies in the future. Bipartisan Haterade You know you’ve messed up as a company when politicians are reaching across the aisle to try and figure out what your problem is. Sens. Josh Hawley (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D) have asked the FTC and SEC to investigate Meta’s reportedly fraud-filled ad ecosystem, according to The Guardian. In a joint letter, the senators cited recent reporting by Reuters that Meta is involved in one-third of all scams in the US and made $16 billion (or 10% of its overall revenue) from fraudulent and scam ads in 2024. This isn’t the first time Hawley and Blumenthal have teamed up against Meta. In April, they announced an investigation into Meta’s alleged collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party to build censorship tools. And, last month, they introduced a bill to Congress that would require AI chatbot companies to enforce stricter age verification measures. Basically, any time Meta makes headlines for something egregious, expect these guys to respond with world-class hater energy. Speaking of which, a newly released legal brief suggests that, in 2019, Meta halted internal research when findings suggested that people who stop using Facebook report feeling less depressed. It should be fun to see what the senators make of that. But Wait! There’s More! Foreign content creators are making bank off America’s polarized political climate.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Pragmatism, not idealism, will determine the fate of Google’s ad tech empire

More from the series → After months of testimony and a final day of unusually pointed questioning, Judge Leonie Brinkema used the closing arguments phase of the U.S. Department of Justice v. Google to give the clearest indication yet of how she is weighing up an appropriate remedy after ruling the defendant a monopolist earlier this year. After Friday’s proceedings, she has now retired to her chambers to mull over a decision over the coming weeks, but for many, a complete divestiture of Google’s ad exchange or ad server (i.e., the entity formerly known as DoubleClick For Publishers within Google Ad Manager) appears increasingly unlikely. During closing arguments, the judge repeatedly steered the discussion away from theory and toward hard practicalities, indicating that pragmatism, more than pure ideals, will (likely) drive the final outcome. This is because Brinkema’s questions consistently pressed the DOJ on implementation timelines, commercial feasibility, and the (what many courtroom attendees perceived as) a lack of concrete detail in its structural remedy plan. “Time is of the essence,” she said at one point, citing the rapid pace of technological change in advertising and AI. Any remedy, she stressed, must be “concrete” and must account for the “commercial reality” of execution. That framing dominated the morning. While DOJ attorney Matthew Huppert reiterated the government’s preference for a structural remedy — divesting AdX, open-sourcing auction logic, or potentially forcing a sale of GAM — he conceded DOJ was “not dogmatic about the details.” But when pressed on specifics, including whether a structural remedy could be implemented during an inevitable appeal, the DOJ offered little. Judge Brinkema, noted that behavioral remedies “could go forward whether there is an appeal pending or not,.” She added, “[Divestiture] is a dramatic change,… [it] would most likely not be as easily enforceable while an appeal was pending.” Google’s Karen Dunn capitalized on that hesitation. Dunn argued the DOJ “did not meet the heavy burden required for a divestiture,” arguing that witnesses for the defense asserted that Google’s proposed remedies would address their concerns. She further outlined Google’s opinion that the DOJ failed to prove behavioral remedies were insufficient; that a technically and commercially workable buyer existed; and that divestiture would restore competition or avoid harms to consumers. During rebuttal, DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood conceded that a buyer has not been identified –although Digiday sources have relayed how loose-lipped attendees at this year’s Advertising Week New York voiced their intentions to take a look at the DFP – while the defendant argued a sale would be “messy, risky and long, with no guarantee of success.” What the ruling will likely look like Taken together, Brinkema’s questions point to a strong likelihood that she will opt against ordering a divestiture — at least not immediately. Her emphasis on timelines, enforceability during appeal, technical feasibility and the need to avoid abstract reasoning suggests she is leaning toward a behavioral-first remedy, potentially supplemented with guardrails or phased requirements. A ruling is expected “likely next year,” she said — most likely in Q1 or Q2 of 2026, based on her remarks. Settlement? Appeal? Hw long will this drag on? Brinkema remarked that she “could see a settlement” that makes sense, though she acknowledged the widening gap between the parties and the existence of “looming settlements” in other ad-tech cases. Realistically, the chance of an agreed resolution appears low. An appeal, however, appears inevitable. Google has signaled as much, and Brinkema repeatedly referenced the complications of crafting remedies that must survive scrutiny. A full appellate cycle could take 18–30 months, pushing any structural remedy (if ordered) well into 2028. In other words, the case may be nearing its first final judgment, but the industry is only entering the next chapter. “We’re entering an odd moment in AI where a huge number of “AI companies” are basically wrappers on top of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or open models like Mistral and Qwen. They don’t own the tech, the data, or the infrastructure — yet they’re being valued as if they do.” – One Digiday source casts a healthy dose of cynicism among the AI hype-cycle Sources suggest Amazon’s latest round of mass layoffs cut headcount in its advertising division by up to 20%, though staff there are paid through the last week of January, making it difficult to establish exact numbers. A new pitch deck making the rounds at agencies drives that point home. Google boss Sunar Pichai warns ‘no company immune’ to AI bubble bursts The most powerful chief executive in the industry says the quiet part out loud. The EU considers cracking down on Big Tech’s cloud power Cloud infrastructure is increasingly part of the consideration of advertisers and their supply chain, and that’s not lost on regulators. Advertisers see now value in news, but Google knows society will pay Richard Gingras, Google’s longtime news policy lead, he continues to push back on the Google-owned web argument, in conversation with Ricky Sutton and Alan Chapell. Yahoo is testing 6 AI agents for advertising, leaked slides show Yahoo hopes to capitalize weariness over Google’s market leadership and the escalating standoff between Amazon and The Trade Desk to further its marketshare of its demand-side platform. Agencies, ad-tech companies and publishers are racing to test AI media agents. Not all those tests are successful — even some that are. The e-commerce giant has quietly blocked more OpenAI-related bots from crawling Amazon.com, according to updates in its publicly visible robots.txt file. Amazon, Disney and Reddit have each expanded their interactive ad formats lately.

Title: Apple eliminates dozens of jobs across its sales organization

Update font size. Reset Apple is cutting dozens of enterprise sales positions as part of a restructuring aimed at simplifying how it sells to businesses, schools, and government clients. The eliminated roles include account managers and staff who ran Apple’s dedicated briefing centers used for institutional meetings and product demos. A company spokesperson confirmed the changes, saying the move will allow Apple to reach more customers, and that impacted employees are eligible to apply for other open positions inside the company. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ Apple confirmed on Monday that it’s reshuffling the division, without giving specifics. “To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles,” a spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. “We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.” It’s unusual for Apple to make cuts across an organization, and the layoffs came as a surprise to those affected. The move is especially notable because revenue has been growing at the fastest clip in years. Apple is on track to generate sales of nearly $140 billion in the December quarter, smashing its previous record. Employees who lost their jobs have until Jan. 20 to secure another position within the company or they’ll be terminated with a severance package. Apple is advertising sales roles on its jobs website and told laid-off workers they could apply for them. Internally, the company is positioning the layoffs as part of an effort to streamline its sales workforce and eliminate overlapping responsibilities. But some of the affected workers said the move was driven by an effort to shift more sales to third-party resellers, which the company refers to as the channel. Some organizations prefer to work with those indirect sellers, they said, and the change helps Apple lower internal costs like salaries. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: When a company decides a different go-to-market model will be more efficient or scalable, certain positions can become superfluous. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. November 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Big Law made one fortune helping private equity lure large investors. Now it’s minting another helping the industry attract small ones. Law firms that have long advised private equity giants on mergers and acquisitions — and often bill more than $1,000 an hour for their services — are joining the industry’s latest treasure hunt: prying open America’s 401(k)s. The lawyers’ lucrative, if unglamorous, task: setting up funds that promise to bring private equity’s rarefied style of investing to everyday people, even as some big institutions pull back from these investments. For the financial-industrial complex — bankers, asset managers, lawyers, financial advisors, record-keepers — the incentive is obvious. All told, nearly $13 trillion is sitting in 401(k) accounts and other defined-contribution retirement plans. Tapping into that trove could help plug gaps left by deep-pocketed pensions and endowments. “More and more people are realizing there’s a lot of money in this,” said Phil Troyer, of counsel at Endeavor Law in Overland Park, Kansas, who specializes in compliance in the retirement-plan industry. Financial advisors say average investors should tread carefully when weighing whether to add private assets to their retirement mix. There’s no guarantee future investment returns will justify the industry’s high fees. Related:DOL Drops Legal Defense of Biden Fiduciary Rule Lawyers, however, can bill today. Legal fees for the structuring and paperwork of a simple private-markets fund for retail investors can sometimes be as much as $1.5 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Ongoing legal work can amount to hundreds of thousands a year. Wall Street lawyers say they’ve never seen anything quite like this. Fund specialists — who once set up far less lucrative mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and were snubbed by some of the big firms — are now so coveted that pay can stretch into seven digits, people close to the firms say. Ho-hum legal work like going through fund regulations and preparing prospectuses suddenly looks like a growth business. And so big-name law firms like Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Kirkland & Ellis are stepping up and looking for talent in an area that, until recently, was far from being a priority. They’re helping the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. set up funds aimed at retail investors. A lawyer at one prominent firm said he recently received 25 inquiries in a single week from private-markets firms looking to get into the 401(k) market. Related:J.P. Morgan Wealth Head at Center of Senator’s Epstein Inquiry Private equity players and their lawyers have been laying the groundwork for this moment for years. Since 2020, the number of semi-liquid private-market funds — which allow periodic cash redemptions — aimed at retail and private-wealth investors has doubled, to roughly 380, according to Preqin. Now, the push is accelerating after President Donald Trump gave the industry a green light to go after the 401(k) market. This year, Apollo, Ares Management Corp., Blackstone, Blue Owl Capital Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, Neuberger Berman and Partners Group all announced new funds for the masses. More are on the way. Simpson Thacher, which advised KKR on its famous 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, has done legal work on more than 50 funds since it started building a retail team in 2014, according to people familiar with the matter, including for Blackstone, Apollo, KKR and TPG Inc. The law firm advised on a new partnership between Blackstone, Vanguard Group — the great popularizer of low-cost index funds — and Vanguard’s longtime partner Wellington Management Co., and a similar tie-up with Capital Group and KKR to bring private-market funds to the masses. To handle the new business, law firms have been shelling out for legal talent. In the past decade, Simpson Thacher has expanded its team for retail funds from a handful of people to include 21 partners and 125 lawyers. Related:Florida Advisor Pleads Guilty to $94M Scheme Targeting Venezuelans Kirkland & Ellis has expanded its unit to about 60 people from fewer than five a half-decade ago and advises at least 60 clients on their retail funds, according to people familiar with the matter. Recent clients include Ares’ Strategic Income Fund and Neuberger Berman’s Private Markets Access Fund. In July it said it’s advising Blue Owl on a strategic partnership with retirement, employee benefits and investment management firm Voya Financial Inc. to develop private-markets products for defined-contribution retirement plans. Two other white-shoe law firms, Davis Polk & Wardwell and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, have been hiring in this area, too. Rajib Chanda, the partner who set up the Simpson Thacher’s retail practice, Kirkland & Ellis partner Erica Berthou and Cleary Gottlieb partner Jeff Karpf each said their firms are following client demand. Davis Polk didn’t respond to requests for comment. Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

Title: Epic CEO: "RAM price increases will be a real problem" — as OpenAI et al. blow up RAM prices, threatening affordability of everything from Xbox to TVs and laptops

The AI fad is destroying the affordability of RAM, as demand from OpenAI, Google, and others blow up prices. Why is this happening? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Gamers can't seem to catch a break, although this latest goldrush is going to impact far more than just gamers this time around. After years of dealing with the crypto craze blowing up GPU prices, the artificial intelligence fad being pushed by companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others, is now having a serious impact on the affordability and scarcity of RAM. For those who don't know, RAM (random access memory) is used as temporary memory storage used to store and access data on a short-term basis. Simplified, you can think of it as your computer's short-term memory, and is designed for on-demand rapidity so apps and games can run instantly. You can find it in basically any "smart" device, from TVs to phones to laptops, to Xbox consoles and gaming PCs. In just a few weeks, the general price of consumer-grade DDR5 RAM has increased in some cases by as much as 110%, with products like Micron's Crucial Pro 32GB DDR5 kit effectively doubling in price in the space of a month. And things might only get worse. Speaking on X, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney described the scale of the problem, as government-backed companies like OpenAI outbid consumer manufacturers on RAM fabrication priorities. RAM price increases will be a real problem for high-end gaming for several years. Factories are diverting leading edge DRAM capacity to meet AI needs where data centers are bidding far higher than consumer device makers. https://t.co/VgO2OG4oOrNovember 24, 2025 Indeed, companies like OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and others are striking massive deals with RAM manufacturers such as Samsung and SK Hynix to supply their data centers. Artificial intelligence is the tech fad du jour, with governments and shareholders seemingly convinced that the technology is critical for national security (and also lowering firm's costs by offloading tasks to clankers robots instead of humans). True or not, it's the main driving force behind these price increases. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. OpenAI and others are being given massive loans and subsidies (often paid for by taxpayers) and require absolutely enormous quantities of electricity, processing, and also memory capacity. Backed by nation states and the full force of Wall Street hype, manufacturers of consumer-grade goods like laptops, video game consoles, and TVs typically already endure thin margins — they cannot outbid the likes of OpenAI on data center component purchasing. Some manufacturers have stockpiled RAM specifically to avoid price increases on their products in the interim to try and weather the storm. There were some rumors that Xbox Series X|S consoles, which have recently endured price increases, would be rapidly exposed to further increases as a result of this. Sources tell me that Microsoft does have a healthy supply of Xbox, Surface, and other RAM-using stock for the time being. But of course, those stocks will not last forever — for any manufacturer. Indeed, the current wave of AI hype doesn't seem likely it will die down any time soon. Once any existing consumer tech supplies dwindle for any manufacturer, products like Xbox and PlayStation consoles, television sets, laptops, and more, could start to see serious price increases over time. The volatility between AI demand and tariffs is why we didn't get the Xbox Ally prices until the very last minute, and why we still don't have the Steam Machine prices either. Things are just generally crazy right now, to use industry terms. The first to feel the pinch will be anyone who is buying RAM standalone to upgrade their PCs or existing laptops. The world only has so much capacity to produce RAM, meaning demand will likely exceed supply for the foreseeable. Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron control some 90% of the market together. Consumer tech manufacturers will bid for chips from these companies directly for their own products. And given the out-sized purchasing power from companies like OpenAI, flooded with investor cash, us peasants will have to endure the scraps for the time being. It's just another thing for the pile of reasons to hate this big AI fad — destroyed livelihoods, greenhouse gasses, electricity prices, layoffs, stolen water supplies, toxic chemicals, turbo-charged false information industry, mental health degradation, and now rapidly ballooning consumer goods prices.

The gloom that has hung over Wall Street in recent weeks showed signs of dissipating on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up about 2.4% in recent trading, leading the major indexes higher after lagging during Friday’s rally. Big tech shares and many of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks were among Monday’s top gainers, with chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) each up more than 7% and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the green. Dip-buying retail investors may be partly responsible. Money poured into S&P 500 exchange-traded funds last week while the index slumped, according to a UBS note, while ETF inflows as a percent of assets under management climbed to their highest level this year—both signs, the analysts wrote, of individual-investor optimism. And inflows into leveraged funds accelerated throughout the sell-off, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, another potential sign of retail's confidence. There are signs of improving investor sentiment, particularly among retail investors, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Retail investor behavior often reflects market sentiment, or vibes, as they usually lack the detailed market data and sophisticated algorithms of institutional investors. Sentiment is itself one of the main drivers of stock market returns. Stocks sold off last week as concerns about an AI bubble and uncertainty about the trajectory of monetary policy weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 lost nearly 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%. Equity positioning turned underweight—indicating caution—for the first time since July, according to Deutsche Bank. Chief among investors’ concerns was whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Signs of a weakening labor market argue for a cut, while evidence that inflation is accelerating well above the Fed's 2% target could drive caution. Rate-cut expectations jumped all over the place last week. The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.

The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.

By Brendan Hesse and Jon Bitner on November 24, 2025 at 11:06AM PST GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Best Buy's Black Friday sale kicked off last week, bringing some massive deals to Nintendo games, hardware, and accessories--but some of the best deals are for Amiibo figures. The retailer has big deals on select figures, and has even restocked a several older releases. Some of the best savings are for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo, which are steeply discounted to just $10 each (normally $30). Similarly, the recently released Street Fighter 6 Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly Switch 2 Amiibo figures are all 50% off at $15 (normally $30). Best Buy also has several hard-to-find characters in stock at their original $16 MSRP--undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections, as well as preorders for upcoming figures like the Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo. Below is a list of all Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: $10 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $10 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $10 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

Time Published: 2025-11-24T18:37:20Z

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.

Title: Wall Street Just Upgraded NVDA, AMZN, and MP Again

Investing Bernstein, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still one of the top stocks to own, according to analysts at Bernstein. The firm, which reiterated an outperform rating on NVDA, says the data center opportunity is still significant and still early, with further upside likely. Remember, NVDA just posted EPS of $1.30, which beat estimates by four cents. Revenue of $57 billion, up 62.5% year over year, beat by $1.91 billion. Data center revenue of $51.2 billion was up 25% quarter over quarter, and up 66% year over year. Analysts only expected NVDA to post EPS of $1.25 on $54.83 billion in sales, which would be a 56% jump year over year. Moving forward, Nvidia expects to generate $65 billion in revenue, which would be above expectations of $61.98 billion. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. In most years, Amazon is a no-brainer stock to buy and hold for the holiday rush. In fact, except for 2022, the e-commerce giant has historically pushed higher heading into the holidays, which we expect to happen again this year. Part of the reason for that is that, according to Adobe Analytics: Also, analysts at BMO just upgraded MP Materials (NYSE: MP) to an outperform rating, noting that the dip is a buying opportunity. Remember, with China’s tight control over rare earths and U.S. demand soaring, rare earth stocks are again center stage. And, as noted by CNBC, “Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.” All of which is fueling upside in MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass mine in California. Two, the U.S. Department of Defense announced it was buying $400 million worth of MP’s preferred stock – positioning itself as the company’s biggest shareholder. And three, MP signed a $500 million deal with Apple, which agreed to buy rare earth magnets from it.

You get a yacht, and you get a yacht When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Analyst estimates of Valve's annual revenue is already around 6% higher than the whole of 2024, meaning it is on track to surpass $17 billion by the end of the year. While this number is already staggering, it is even more impressive in context of how many people the company employs, with likely less than 400 staff members working at the gaming giant. Steam's owner Valve is one of the few independent gaming companies of its size, and this means that despite how much money it makes, it's able to hold its cards close to its chest. This is where analysts help us out, with Alinea Analytics estimating that the company has already earned more than $16.3 billion in the first 11 months of this year. Steam has generated $16B+ in revenue so far this year (@alineaanalytics estimates)That's already up 5.7% from 2024's final total!Taking Valve's cuts into account (and 100% cuts of its own juggernauts CS2 and Dota 2), Valve itself has made over $4B+ this year from Steam. pic.twitter.com/PlMCjDEEgDNovember 13, 2025 Despite Valve's momentous revenue, it only has a few hundred employees. The last time employee information was made public was in 2024, when court documents from 2021 that weren't properly redacted were discovered. As reported by The Verge, the company claimed to have just 336 employees on the payroll, but has likely expanded due to the launch of the Steam Deck. Working with estimates, Valve likely earns $40 - 50 million per employee, blowing companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft out of the water. The Xbox parent company makes the most of the three (I'm sure in no small part due to its history of mass layoffs), but it isn't even close to big daddy Valve at just $18 million per staff member. Valve has been aware that it's on to a winning formula since at least 2012 when it wrote some industry-standard-breaking statements in its still available employee handbook. Not only does the book inform employees that "100%" of their work will be "self-directed projects", but that their pay will be directly correlated with what they produce. "Valve pays people very well compared to industry norms," the book states. "Our profitability per employee is higher than that of Google or Amazon or Microsoft, and we believe strongly that the right thing to do in that case is to put a maximum amount of money back into each employee’s pocket. Valve does not win if you’re paid less than the value you create. And people who work here ultimately don’t win if they get paid more than the value they create." While this last statement looks like a way of paying Valve staff less than desireably, the above mentioned court documents showed that the average Valve employee earned $1.3 million per year back in 2021. Might not be the $50 million that Valve is raking in per person, but Gabe Newell needs to buy his yachts somehow, eh? Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Steam Machine price "more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market," confirms Valve – but "ideally we'd be pretty competitive with that and have a pretty good deal."

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Tesla's (TSLA) stock popped 7%, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 Monday after CEO Elon Musk posted on social media over the weekend that the company plans to build more AI chips than all others combined. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) jumped over 5% to an all-time high, extending their recent gains amid excitement about the tech giant’s Gemini 3 AI model launched last week. Centene (CNC), Elevance Health (ELV), and Molina Healthcare (MOH) shares all rose following reports President Trump would back a health care proposal extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Carvana (CVNA) shares surged nearly 7% following an upgrade to "outperform" from "neutral" by analysts at Wedbush, who called the vehicle retailer the “new used car king.” Novo Nordisk (NVO) sank after the drugmaker said its latest drug trial was not effective in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's.

Title: AMD to raise graphics card prices by at least 10% in 2026 — price surge attributed to ongoing AI-related DRAM supply crisis

Rising memory prices blamed as GPUs look set to become more expensive in 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After weeks of hints and speculation, it's now (almost) official: AMD has told its supply partners that it will raise graphics cards prices by at least 10% in the new-year due to rising memory prices, as per analyst Dan Nystedt (via UDN). This is reportedly the second time AMD has raised its prices in recent months, though the first was kept internal and just ate into AMD's margins. This time though, it's passing it on to the partners, who will in turn pass it on to consumers. AMD has notified supply chain partners it will raise graphics card prices 10% across the entire product line due to rising memory chip prices, media report. It will reportedly be AMD’s 2nd such price increase. $AMD $NVDA #Semiconductors https://t.co/pi2hsmmhCANovember 24, 2025 The subject of graphics card pricing has been a contentious one for a number of years now. Prices and power draw have risen generation upon generation, and cryptocurrency-induced shortages have occasionally spiked demand and the cost of a new GPU in turn. 2025 started with something similar, though that seemed to be more down to deliberately constrained supply — or perhaps a shift of Nvidia and AMD's focus to AI. That's only become more apparent throughout the year, and as data centers the world over ate up GPUs, CPUs, memory, storage, and anything else they could get their hands on (including entire power plants), prices for most components have risen in turn. None quite so much as memory, though, which has jumped close to 200% per stick in recent months, and that shortage is now making its way into other industries: most notably, graphics cards. PowerColor recently warned that GPU price rises were coming, and AMD seems to have now confirmed it to its suppliers and board partners. In the translated text, UDN's sources claim it'll be by at least 10%, suggesting that could be the floor of AMD's potential price rises. However, Mr Nystedt suggests that 10% is the figure, so we'll have to wait and see how it shakes out or for an official announcement from AMD, to know for sure. This is unfortunate timing for AMD which has struggled to get the price of its flagship RX 9070 XT even close to its recommended retail price throughout the year. It just managed it this week, hitting $599 for the first-time since release as part of Black Friday. But that seems likely to be incredibly short-lived. Not least because that's a decent deal for a great graphics card. AMD is unlikely to be alone in its GPU prices rises either. Nvidia is expected to have delayed the launch of an RTX 50 Super series of graphics cards because of memory shortages, and unlikely to lose profit on its graphics cards when selling to gamers since it makes so much selling them to data center developers. If you're keen to get ahead of the price rises and want to buy a graphics card before the end of the year, here's our list of the best graphics cards out there right now.

Title: Jeff Bezos' Grim US Economy Prediction Is Coming True
URL: https://www.moneydigest.com/2034736/jeff-bezos-grim-us-economy-prediction-coming-true/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
It's hard to turn around without encountering a grim financial prediction these days, and many well-known figures in the finance sphere have had something to say about it. Between the budgetary impact tariffs have on families, the rising cost of groceries, and a higher cost of living for most Americans, even some of the wealthiest people in the country are feeling uneasy. While the economy may not ever be grinding too hard on Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, that doesn't change the fact that he made a grim economic prediction that is now coming true. In a 2023 interview with CNN, Bezos warned, "The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down. You're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy." While this observation may not have predicted the sweeping job losses due to 2025's DOGE job and budget cuts, the labor market has hit a brick wall. Per analysis by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, hiring frequency is the lowest it's been in 14 years. The company's November 2025 reporting stated the United States had cut more than 1 million jobs by October 2025, the highest layoff total since the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing in 2020. However, Bezos' fortune-telling didn't stop there. Bezos warned consumers and small business owners to "play the probabilities" by cutting big spending. He suggested it might be preferable to have some cash reserves, rather than new gear or appliances, if things get even worse — advice that still rings darkly true in 2025. Bezos did not predict economic recession, but his interview confirms the complex nature of what was to come. Even so, in his CNN interview, he clearly pushed risk aversion across the board, saying, "Try to reduce some risk in your business or your life." Bezos floats near the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and despite being one of the richest men in the world, the advice he gave feels applicable to people in many economic classes. For business owners, Bezos warned, "Maybe delay some capital purchases. Do you really need that new piece of equipment? Maybe it could wait a little bit," before going on to say that even small precautions like that delay could be what keeps a business afloat amid economic turmoil. Investors in the market have seen wild volatility in 2025, making Bezos' words seem relevant to pretty much all financial sectors. However, the market bursts as much as it sags, and both small and large investments could have significant weight on many individuals' financial situations. Bezos's suggestion that small business owners avoid risky business also goes against much of what he's done to build his own empire. Bezos is obsessed with taking risks, and he's preoccupied with absorbing competition. In fact, part of why Amazon is so massive is the amount of investment the company made in taking over so many competitors in its path. Americans spend a ton on Amazon every month, so listening to Bezos' business advice might make sense. However, he founded Amazon out of a garage, as a bookselling operation. He's now backing an AI company to program proteins. That doesn't happen without risk. Bezos has been accused of underpaying workers, sneakily underpaying himself, and doing everything to avoid taxes. It takes more than greed and avarice to succeed, but a close look at Bezos's early history shows a degree of strategy beyond using brutish amounts of cash to buy up everything around him. "Take as much risk off the table as you can for yourself," Bezos insisted at the end of his CNN interview. Frugality and austerity may work for surviving the toughest of economic times, but no one knows an individual business better than the owner. Penny pinching too heavily can be the reason a small business fails, rather than thrives. Not purchasing a desperately needed new appliance like a fridge could mean a lot of food and energy goes to waste, and money would go along with it. Everyone must try to best weigh their own economic decisions with their own reality. For some, it might work out to follow some of Bezos' actions rather than his words. After all, if you invested in Amazon 20 years ago, you would be very wealthy now.

Wall Street funds, including BlackRock , have been cutting MicroStrategy exposure because the original “high-beta Bitcoin proxy” trade has broken down and the risk/reward on MSTR now looks worse than just owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. A mix of aggressive dilution, leverage, governance concerns, and looming index/mandate issues has turned what was a clean proxy into something closer to a complex, quasi-closed-end Bitcoin fund with rising structural risks.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin may dip below $80K before the Fed ends QT on Dec 1. Market liquidity shows early signs of improvement. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement. Hayes believes that this could probably lead to a Bitcoin BTC $87 595 24h volatility: 0.3% Market cap: $1.75 T Vol. 24h: $65.32 B price recovery, while staying confident that liquidity conditions would improve after the US Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1. Crypto industry veteran Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin may continue to trade below the $90,000 level in the near term. He also flagged the possibility of one final BTC price move toward the low-$80,000 range. However, he believes the $80,000 level is likely to hold as support. minor improvements in $ liq:– fed qt stops dec 1, this wed will prob be last fall in b/s– us banks increased lending in nov we chop below $90k, maybe one more stab down into low $80k's but i think $80k holds. might start nibbling, but leave the bazooka until the new year — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 24, 2025 Despite the pullback, Hayes indicated he is considering small accumulation but plans to delay larger purchases until early next year. Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement, while highlighting two key developments. The first is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to halt quantitative tightening on December 1. The other big improvement is that U.S. banks increased lending activity in November. Both hint at greater liquidity, which could benefit risk-on assets like BTC and digital assets. In a similar prediction, market research firm Swissblock noted a sharp decline in its “Risk-Off Signal,” indicating that the most intense phase of selling may have passed. The firm added that any remaining weakness is likely to appear as a smaller, secondary wave, potentially signaling seller exhaustion. This ultimately signals a shift towards buying momentum ahead. As per data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded US$1.94 billion in outflows last week, extending the four-week total to US$4.92 billion. This marks the third-largest continuous outflow period since 2018. Bitcoin accounted for the largest share, with US$1.27 billion exiting the asset during the week, amid the BTC price correction. However, the report noted a partial reversal on Friday, when the asset saw US$225 million in inflows. Last week, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF saw record outflows, leading the pack. The early trading hours on Monday, November 24, show that the fund continues to bleed further. BlackRock just deposited another 2,822 $BTC($243.59M) and 36,283 $ETH($101.72M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/cAFKd0xDCY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 24, 2025 Ethereum ETH $2 933 24h volatility: 1.2% Market cap: $354.37 B Vol. 24h: $22.78 B also faced significant pressure, with US$589 million withdrawn.

In early 2021, an army of retail traders made massive bets on meme stocks and briefly melted down the market. Trading volume swelled to such a huge extent that popular brokerage Robinhood had to halt buy orders for stocks like GameStop for a few days in order to escape a liquidity crisis. At the time, the situation led to claims of a conspiracy, but the reason for the meltdown was more mundane: Wall Street’s creaky infrastructure could not settle trades fast enough. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and others called for an overhaul, and since then there has already been progress, as stock trades now settle a day sooner than in 2021. But the financial industry is also pushing ahead with a more radical solution: turning stocks into digital assets that can be traded and settled instantly on a blockchain. It is not just crypto firms and fintech players leading this charge for “tokenization.” Big banks like J.P. Morgan are also using blockchains to facilitate trades in certain assets and, in doing so, transforming the financial ecosystem more broadly. Already, tokenization—which Tenev has described as a “freight train” poised to eat Wall Street—has brought fundamental changes to how stocks and other assets are traded. The potential upsides to tokenization are huge, but significant questions remain over how to implement it. Meanwhile, some fear the coming train could undermine some protections for individual “retail” investors and destabilize a U.S. equities market whose reliability has for decades been the envy of the world. The tokenization wave isn’t the first push to overhaul Wall Street’s under-the-hood operations. In the 1970s, traders confronted what became known as the “paperwork crisis,” which saw stock markets, drowning in orders, shut down mid-week simply to keep up with recordkeeping. Repeated work stoppages finally led to a computer-based solution. “Once upon a time there were leather-bound journals that said who owns all the stock,” explains Robert Leshner, a former economist who now runs the tokenization firm Superstate. “Then, people said, ‘This is too hard, let’s not update anymore,’ so they decided to create a legal fiction that assigned ownership of all the stock to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation,” or DTCC. The DTCC regime, which has been in place for decades, means it’s no longer necessary to record every single share transfer. Instead, the clearinghouse keeps track of the stock held by different brokerages on behalf of their customers and settles up transactions between those brokerages the next business day. Under this system, the brokerages nominally own the stock, but all the rights that attach to it—dividends, voting privileges, and so on—remain with the customers. The system has worked pretty well over the decades, and for those who insist on doing things the old-fashioned way, DTCC means they can still demand physical copies of their shares. (This option is popular with “GameStop truthers,” who believe reverting to paper will thwart a Wall Street conspiracy against retail investors.) Now, though, the current DTCC system of “T+1”—in which the clearinghouse closes out trades the next business day by reconciling accounts among brokerages—has come to feel outdated in an age when so much business is conducted instantly and around the clock. This has prompted companies like Leshner’s Superstate to offer a faster alternative. The startup is working with companies to issue versions of their shares that trade on a blockchain, an arrangement under which the firms don’t have to rely on intermediaries to hold or track their stock. It also means stock trades can be settled instantly, while allowing firms to interact with their shareholders more directly. Outside the U.S., tokenized assets are already helping investors avoid big trading commissions and invest in private companies like SpaceX Other firms are approaching tokenization in a different fashion. Robinhood, for example, doesn’t help firms tokenize their stocks, but instead takes stocks available on the open market and offers them in a blockchain “wrapper” as a sort of derivative. These offerings are currently available only in Europe, where stock owners can buy and sell the “Stock Tokens” alongside assets like Bitcoin. Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

MAGA Liz Wolfe | 11.24.2025 9:30 AM Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. "I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more," the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video: My message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1 — Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025 Greene struck predictably populist America First notes ("Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests") and mapped her disagreements with the president ("H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Until recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a "ranting lunatic." The Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. "I don't see political party lines," said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs. "I don't know what happened to Marjorie," said Trump recently. "Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think." Many of her constituents are still behind her. "I feel like she has stood her ground," Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of "unwavering support" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. "She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times. Scenes from New York: "Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again," argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. "In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'" Q: Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist? MAMDANI: I've spoken about-- TRUMP: That's okay. You can just say yes.

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global low fat cheese market was valued at US$ 121.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 160.1 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2025–2033. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must recognize that vague health claims no longer satisfy consumers; specific nutrient density is the new currency. For instance, Babybel Light has set a strict calorie-controlled benchmark with exactly 50 calories per piece, while Sargento Reduced Fat Sharp Cheddar directly addresses lipid concerns by delivering just 5 grams of fat per serving. Concurrently, protein maximization is reshaping formulation strategies, evidenced by Arla Protein Lite Cheddar slices offering a substantial 20 grams of protein per serving. Similarly, Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese provides a robust 14 grams of protein per half-cup serving. Arla’s innovation extends further, boasting 40% less fat than standard cheddar, proving that consumers demand high functionality without dietary compromise. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/low-fat-cheese-market Beyond macronutrients, sodium reduction has become a precise science within the low fat cheese market. Standard Swiss cheese naturally leads with a low 53 milligrams of sodium per ounce, setting a high bar for processed alternatives. In the cooking segment, Ricotta cheese averages 123 milligrams of sodium per half-cup serving, whereas newer low-salt white cheese formulations in 2024 have reached 400 milligrams of sodium per 30-gram serving. Manufacturers like Sargento are also fortifying these reduced-fat matrices with Vitamin A Palmitate to restore lost nutritional density. These meticulous specifications highlight a shift where every milligram counts in the consumer's decision-making process. Key Findings in Low Fat Cheese Market Global Production Capabilities are Shaping Supply Chain Availability Supply volume acts as the backbone of the growing low fat cheese market, with global cheese production forecast to reach a massive 22.55 million metric tons in the 2024/2025 marketing year. Within the United States, total cheese production was projected to hit 6.55 million metric tons in 2024, providing ample base material for nutritional modification. Specifically, Italian-type cheese production—critical for low-fat mozzarella variants—totaled 499 million pounds in August 2024 alone. Notably, US Mozzarella production accounts for 79.5% of the total Italian cheese category, significantly outpacing American-type cheese production, which totaled 478 million pounds in the same month. Regional production hubs in the low fat cheese market are adjusting their outputs to feed this global appetite. Australia's cheese production is projected to reach 435,000 metric tons in 2024, while New Zealand produced 400,000 tons in the 2023/2024 cycle to meet export needs. Domestically, US per capita cheese consumption reached nearly 42 pounds per person in the 2024 reporting cycle, signaling robust demand. Trends indicate that Mozzarella sticks will see the fastest segment growth through 2034, while Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024. Such volume data confirms that the market is supported by a highly active global production network. Inventory Deficits Signal Tightening Conditions For Market Stakeholders Recent data suggests a tightening of supply that could increase urgency within the low fat cheese market. US natural cheese stocks in cold storage dropped by 33 million pounds in September 2024, a significant contraction relative to expectations. Furthermore, the US$A revised its August 2024 stock figures downward by 6.6 million pounds, compounding the deficit. American cheese stocks specifically fell by 29 million pounds in September 2024. These reductions imply that demand is outpacing immediate storage capabilities, creating potential pinch points for retailers seeking consistent inventory flow. However, contrasting inventory signals present a complex landscape for buyers. Total butter stocks exceeded forecasts by 7 million pounds in September 2024, creating a divergence between fat and protein commodities. Forward-looking projections for December 2024 showed a potential 19 million pound surplus in cheese stocks, suggesting relief may be on the horizon. In related protein sectors, pork bellies stocks dropped 25% in August 2024, while overall US natural cheese supplies ended August 2024 1% lower than the previous month. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must navigate these mixed inventory signals to optimize procurement strategies. Volatile Wholesale Costs are Directly Influencing Retail Margin Structures Fluctuations in raw material costs are currently dictating the profitability of the low fat cheese market. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cheddar block prices traded at US$ 1.79 per pound for the week ending November 15, 2025, showing distinct volatility compared to the US$ 1.50 per pound recorded in January 2024. Meanwhile, Cheddar barrel prices reached US$ 2.005 per pound in August 2024, creating an unusual dynamic where processing cheese cost more than blocks. The price gap between block and barrel cheese stood at 4.75 cents in August 2024, a metric that processors watch closely when calculating margins for shredded low-fat blends. International auctions reflect similarly high valuations for key ingredients. Global Cheddar cheese prices at the Global Dairy Trade auction averaged US$ 4,973 per metric ton in November 2024, while Mozzarella prices averaged US$ 4,607 per metric ton. Additionally, Dry whey prices—often used in protein fortification—averaged 62.6 cents per pound in November 2025. These input costs force manufacturers in the low fat cheese market to balance premium pricing with competitive value propositions. Rising wholesale indices suggest that cost containment will remain a primary challenge for the remainder of the fiscal year. Premium Retail Pricing Reflects Strong Demand For Healthy Variants Retailers are successfully maintaining premium price points, validating the value-add nature of the low fat cheese market. Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese, for example, retails for US$ 6.49 per 16-ounce tub, positioning it as a high-tier option. In the snacking aisle, Babybel Reduced Fat commands approximately US$ 4.99 at major US retailers, while Knudsen Lowfat Cottage Cheese holds a similar price point of US$ 4.99 for a 16-ounce container. These consistent price floors indicate that health-conscious consumers are willing to absorb higher costs for perceived nutritional benefits. Convenience formats further enhance margin potential for retailers in the low fat cheese market. Sargento Balanced Breaks retail for US$ 4.99 per 3-pack unit, capitalizing on the intersection of health and portability. Similarly, Frigo Cheese Heads in the string cheese segment retail for US$ 6.49 for a 10-ounce pack. Even in the meal category, Amy’s Kitchen Light in Sodium Macaroni & Cheese retails for US$ 3.79 per 9-ounce package, while Organic Valley 2% Milk—a key input proxy—retails for US$ 5.99 per gallon. These figures confirm that the market supports robust pricing structures across diverse product categories. Expanding International Trade Volumes are Reshaping Export Demand Channels in Low Fat Cheese Market Export markets are absorbing a significant portion of production, acting as a vital release valve for the market. US cheese exports totaled 42,459 metric tons in August 2024 alone. Impressively, cumulative US cheese exports for the first eight months of 2024 reached roughly 60,146 metric tons above the previous year's baseline. Mexico remains a primary partner, with exports increasing by 2,256 metric tons in August 2024. Within that flow, exports of "Other Cheese"—a category often housing processed and low-fat blends—rose by 1,942 metric tons, highlighting specific demand for versatile formulations. Global appetite extends beyond North America low fat cheese market, influencing long-term trade forecasts. US cheese exports to the MENA region increased by 1,245 metric tons in August 2024. Looking ahead, Japan is forecast to import an additional 6,886 metric tons of US cheddar-type cheeses between 2025 and 2026, adding to a total import volume that exceeded 251,913 metric tons. However, shifts are evident; Cheddar exports to Japan fell by 1,742 metric tons in August 2024, suggesting a pivot toward other varieties. With total US cheese exports for 2024 forecast to hit a record 508,808 metric tons, international trade remains a pillar of the market. Major Market Players Face Intense Competition From Private Label The competitive landscape of the low fat cheese market is defined by a battle between legacy brands and store-brand dominance. Sargento Foods remains a powerhouse, reporting peak annual revenue of US$ 1.3 billion in 2024, with shredded unit sales recorded at 116 million units. However, Kraft continues to lead in volume, with shredded unit sales reaching 266 million units. Despite these massive branded numbers, Private Label shredded cheese—often the entry point for budget-conscious low-fat shoppers—achieved a staggering 1.25 billion unit sales, dwarfing individual branded competitors. Smaller segments show equally fierce positioning battles. Tillamook recorded 42 million unit sales in the natural cheese category, carving out a premium niche. In the shelf-stable arena, Sargento holds the position of the No. 8 seller, while Mondelēz International saw cheese unit sales of 13 million. These metrics illustrate that while brand equity drives revenue, volume in the low fat cheese market is heavily swayed by private label accessibility. Brands must therefore innovate relentlessly to justify their price premiums against generic alternatives. Looking for Country-Level or Section-Wise Data? Customize This Report: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/report-walkthrough/low-fat-cheese-market Product Innovations and Dietary Inclusivity Define Future Growth Vectors Innovation in 2024 has focused heavily on "permissible indulgence" and dietary inclusivity. Arla Foods launched a new line of organic low-fat cottage cheese in February 2024, catering to the clean-label demographic. Similarly, Saputo Inc. introduced LightLife Mozzarella Shreds for foodservice, while Horizon Organic introduced a new organic low-fat cheese product in April 2024. These launches underscore the industry's pivot toward functional, high-quality offerings that elevate the perception of the low fat cheese market. Europe’s market value of US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 further validates the scale of this opportunity. Beyond traditional dairy, allergen-free attributes are expanding the addressable market. Babybel Plant-Based contains 0 grams of lactose, appealing to those with sensitivities, while Bel Brands expanded its dairy-free distribution to major retailers like Costco in 2024. Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024, driven by its versatility in healthy cooking. Furthermore, gluten-free and lactose-free claims were key drivers in Arla's 2024 product expansions. These diverse innovation vectors ensure that the low fat cheese market remains dynamic and relevant to evolving consumer lifestyles.

Title: Strong Earnings Highlight Growing Investor Confidence in Hospitality Automation

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AINewsWire AINewsWire AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AINewsWire Editorial Coverage: Amid persistent inflation, cautious capital markets and uneven industry performance, investors are placing heightened importance on one metric above all: whether a company can deliver credible, measurable earnings improvement. This scrutiny is especially pronounced in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and service robotics, where technological breakthroughs are plentiful but true financial execution is less common. That distinction helps explain why Nightfood Holdings Inc. (NGTF) (Profile) stands out following its most recent quarterly results, which reported an approximately $91.5 million increase in temporary equity. The gain stems from the company’s strategic hotel acquisitions, designed to accelerate deployment of its AI-driven robotics model. According to Nightfood, completing and converting these transactions is expected to materially strengthen the company’s balance sheet and support its progress toward uplisting, marking a significant milestone in its evolution into a data-centric hospitality automation platform. In doing so, the company is emerging as a leader at the intersection of hospitality, artificial intelligence and robotics, alongside other innovators in the AI and automation space, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM). Click here to view the custom infographic of the Nightfood Holdings editorial. Automation Race Sharpens, Financial Performance Becomes True Differentiator As automation reshapes service industries worldwide, the hospitality market has become a real-time testing ground for AI-driven robotics. With wages rising, staffing shortages persisting and hotels requiring 24/7 operational consistency, demand for automated systems capable of handling guest services, logistics and routine workflows continues to climb. Independent analysts point to accelerating adoption. Grand View Research projects the global service robotics sector to expand from roughly $47 billion in 2023 to about $107.8 billion by 2030, propelled by increased uptake in hospitality, logistics, healthcare and retail. For hotel operators, AI-enhanced automation has quickly shifted from “emerging technology” to competitive requirement. Robots are being deployed for food and beverage delivery, restocking, housekeeping support and customer interaction. One industry survey found that 78% of hotel leaders expect to increase technology spending over the next three years, highlighting the sector’s push toward workflow automation, digital guest services and AI-enabled efficiency. These investments are motivated by more than operational convenience. Research indicates that companies integrating robotics into labor-intensive processes can achieve 20–30% cost reductions, especially in repetitive and high-turnover functions. Yet financial markets remain wary of automation firms that lack measurable traction. Despite impressive engineering, many robotics companies remain in pilot phases or prerevenue. In contrast, a smaller set of innovators is beginning to demonstrate tangible balance sheet improvement, recurring revenue opportunities and scaling capability. In today’s macroeconomic climate, quarterly financial performance serves as a vital indicator of credibility and separates viable automation platforms from unproven concepts. Strategic Acquisitions Drive $91.5M Equity Improvement Nightfood reported an estimated $91.5 million improvement in temporary equity for the quarter ending September 30, 2025. This momentum can be directly tied to two major hotel portfolio acquisitions that the company views as foundational infrastructure for its AI-driven Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) strategy. On September 18, Nightfood closed a $31 million transaction for a 155-room Holiday Inn property, describing it as an AI hospitality innovation hub. This location functions as a living laboratory where the company can refine its robotics systems, measure efficiency gains and demonstrate real-world utility. Soon after, Nightfood announced an agreement involving a $52.8 million Hilton Garden Inn portfolio, further broadening its operational base. These hospitality assets are intended not only to support robotics deployment but to eventually convert into perpetual equity, reducing financing costs and strengthening long-term capital efficiency. The dual outcome, operational scale and stronger capitalization, is a key component of the company’s strategy. Unlike robotics firms relying exclusively on external clients, Nightfood’s approach integrates technology into properties it owns or operates. This allows the company to collect performance data, trial new automation tools and capture the economic upside produced by efficiency improvements. It also positions the company to iterate faster, validate commercial use cases and ultimately expand with a more compelling value proposition. Equity Conversion Poised to Lift Shareholder Value Nightfood has stated that much of the newly consolidated temporary equity is expected to convert to perpetual equity upon uplisting, an inflection point that may materially strengthen long-term financial stability. Transforming temporary financing structures into permanent equity reduces uncertainty, improves debt-to-equity ratios and enhances valuation metrics that institutional investors closely monitor. “These transactions enhance our platform with substantial assets, revenue streams and operational capacity,” the company stated. “More importantly, the consolidation of these entities resulted in the recognition of $91.5 million in additional temporary equity, dramatically strengthening our balance sheet.” “Management believes that a significant portion of this temporary equity will convert to perpetual equity upon the company’s anticipated uplisting, further enhancing long-term shareholder value,” the announcement continued. “But beyond the financial impact, these acquisitions are cornerstones of our strategy to build a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem. By combining automation innovation with hard real estate assets, we are creating a unique model where our robotics technology can be deployed, tested, and scaled within our own properties, while simultaneously generating recurring hospitality revenue.” The company further emphasized that converting this equity upon uplisting could help establish a vertically integrated robotics ecosystem, where automation technology is deployed and scaled across company-controlled hotel environments. This model allows Nightfood to test, optimize and commercialize its robotics systems while generating recurring hospitality revenue and building long-term enterprise value. Advancing Toward Uplisting and Institutional-Grade Financial Standards The company’s strengthened financials support its next strategic objective: readiness for uplisting to a national exchange. Such a transition typically requires more rigorous governance, stronger balance sheet fundamentals and enhanced disclosure standards. For AI and robotics companies competing for market share, uplisting represents a powerful differentiator. Access to institutional capital markets is especially valuable for automation platforms that require sustained investment to scale hardware, software and deployment infrastructure. Firms operating solely on over-the-counter markets may face higher capital costs and reduced investor visibility. By restructuring its financial position and pursuing uplisting, Nightfood aims to align itself with companies capable of meeting institutional expectations, an increasingly important signal in an environment where investors are scrutinizing fundamentals more closely than ever. Strengthened Financials Support RaaS Acceleration Nightfood’s improved capital position is intended to fuel expansion of its RaaS platform, a subscription-driven business model that deploys autonomous robots across hotel operations. RaaS allows customers to adopt robotics with minimal upfront cost, while generating predictable recurring revenue for the provider, a useful model in industries facing labor instability. This milestone aligns with the company’s larger plan to transition under its robotics brand and operate as an asset-backed automation enterprise built around scalable hotel-based deployment centers. The company’s vertically integrated approach enables it to deploy robots for delivery, cleaning and operational analytics within its own properties, using these facilities as controlled testbeds for real-world optimization. In addition, strengthening the capital structure enhances Nightfood’s ability to secure future funding and advance its uplisting objectives. By retaining control, Nightfood can iterate more quickly, measure system performance and capture more of the economic gains associated with automation. These hotel hubs effectively function as distributed robotics development and deployment centers. Capital Strength Positions Company for High-Growth Market Expansion The company’s bolstered capital structure provides a runway for growth in the wider commercial automation sector. Service robotics are increasingly becoming mission-critical components of business operations, particularly in environments challenged by workforce shortages. Multiple industry research suggests that companies adopting robotics outperform peers during recovery cycles, due in part to efficiency gains and operating leverage associated with automation. With Nightfood’s expanding hospitality automation hubs and reinforced balance sheet, the company aims to establish a defensible position in this accelerating market. By combining real estate-backed deployment infrastructure, a recurring RaaS model and a strengthened financial foundation, Nightfood is positioning itself to participate meaningfully in the multibillion-dollar service robotics market. As automation shifts from experimental to essential across hospitality and commercial sectors, the company’s financial progress signals not only operational traction but a growing role in shaping the future of AI-powered hotel automation. Global Leaders Accelerate Innovation Across AI Landscape Artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a rapid pace as major innovators worldwide deepen their investments in infrastructure, enterprise-grade platforms and transformative real-world deployments. From large-scale data center expansion to new AI-driven productivity tools and advanced computing rollouts, the latest developments reflect a sector moving quickly into its next phase of global integration. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) will join a joint venture (JV) aimed to support the development of Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading provider of world-class AI solutions for regional and global customers. The company will partner with Cisco and HUMAIN, a PIF company delivering global full-stack AI solutions in the JV. According to the AMD, the three companies will serve as founding investors in the effort, which is expected to begin operations in 2026 with plans to combine HUMAIN’s state-of-the-art data centers with AMD and Cisco technology, delivering modern data-center capacity with efficient power and lower capital expenditures. AMD and Cisco will act as exclusive technology partners to the joint venture, contributing their portfolio of products and services to its development of up to 1 GW of AI infrastructure by 2030. Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA) announced the general availability of Pega Infinity '25, the industry’s first agentic enterprise transformation platform to deliver trustworthy, predictable AI agents at scale. New features empower organizations to reimagine legacy systems, automate work with reliable AI agents and boost productivity. According to the company, enterprise leaders modernizing legacy systems with AI are finding most agentic AI solutions fall short, with new MIT research revealing that 95% of enterprise AI initiatives fail. Pega Infinity takes a fundamentally different approach, harnessing AI’s creative potential while promoting dependable execution for enterprise-grade reliability. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) is working with Arizona State University (ASU) to make it the first Division I NCAA football program in the nation to deploy a fleet of AI PCs during the 2025-26 off season. Piloting this technology will give coaches, players and staff a competitive edge on and off the field, transforming how the team recruits, prepares and engages its fan base. ASU is deploying a fleet of Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Gen 1 PCs, powered by the Intel vPro(R) platform, to its football program to evaluate how on-device AI can help the team work smarter and optimize their performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) plans to expand its investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States by an additional $100 billion. Building on the company’s ongoing $65 billion investment in its advanced semiconductor manufacturing operations in Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC’s total investment in the U.S. is expected to reach $165 billion. The expansion includes plans for three new fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major R&D team center, solidifying this project as the largest single foreign direct investment in U.S. history. These advancements illustrate how rapidly the AI ecosystem is expanding and how diverse its applications have become. As these initiatives move from planning to full deployment, they will help define the capabilities, competitiveness and global reach of AI technologies in the decade ahead.

Title: Average rents at almost €4,000 a month in Ireland’s priciest area

Landlords in Foxrock, Co Dublin, are commanding the highest average rents in the State at almost €4,000 a month, latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. Renting a home in the south Dublin neighbourhood in the first quarter of this year would set a household back an average of €3,718 a month, said the CSO. Areas in south Dublin had the top 10 highest rents at the start of the year, with Goatstown in second place (€3,104 per month), followed by Dalkey, Killiney, Glenageary, Sandymount, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, where average rents were €2,547. Outside Dublin the highest rents were in Greystones and Delgany, both in Co Wicklow (€2,331 and €2,077 per month), Bishopstown, Co Cork (€2,043) and Barna, Co Galway (€1,961). Across local authority housing, there was a 6 per cent increase in rents on average over the 12 months to September 2025. The rental figures, drawn from Residential Tenancies Board statistics, are among a wealth of information collated on the CSO’s housing information hub, including property prices, housing commencements and completions, planning permissions and vacant dwellings numbers. Property prices continued to increase this year compared with last, though by almost twice as much outside Dublin (9.4 per cent) as in the capital (5.3 per cent). On new homes, the number of dwellings granted planning permission was down 13 per cent – from 8,513 units in the third quarter of last year to 7,447 in 2025. However, the number of dwelling completions was up 13 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, standing at 24,325, compared with the same period in 2024. There were 177,600 people working in the construction industry. Among these, 67 per cent mainly worked on new housing developments or renovations. Average hourly labour costs for the sector were €34.22 in third quarter of this year, up from €30.85 in the second quarter of last year. Data shows that home heating fuels of choice are changing. As of the third quarter this year the most common main heating fuel across all dwellings was gas (35 per cent), followed by heating oil and electricity. For homes built since 2015 however, the most common heating fuel was electricity. Homes constructed from 2020 to the third quarter of this year were 93 per cent electrically heated, with 6 per cent using gas and less than 1 per cent using oil. Statistics on building energy ratings (BERs) show Kildare had the highest proportion of A-rated homes (28 per cent), followed by Meath (27 per cent) and Dublin county (27 per cent), while the lowest were in Leitrim and Cork city (both 5 per cent). The highest proportions of G-rated dwellings were in counties Roscommon and Leitrim (11 per cent). [ ‘I don’t think Balbriggan was ready for this amount of people’: The challenges facing a Dublin commuter townOpens in new window ] In the Dublin postal districts, the highest proportions of A-rated homes were in Dublin 18 which includes Foxrock, Sandyford and Stepaside (43 per cent), Dublin 13 including Sutton and Howth (31 per cent), and Dublin 20 including Chapelizod and Palmerstown (28 per cent). The lowest level of A ratings in the capital was 7 per cent in Dublin 7, which includes Cabra, Phibsborough and Smithfield. In the last three months of 2023, the estimated national vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent based on low to zero electricity consumption in a dwelling. The local authorities with the highest vacancy rates this period were Leitrim (8.5 per cent), Roscommon (6.5 per cent) and Mayo (6.4 per cent).

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are pointing to a higher open for major indexes to kick off the holiday-shortened trading week; market participants are growing increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month; bitcoin regained some ground over the weekend after weeks of declines; U.S. officials are in Europe for tariff negotiations; and Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares are sinking following the results of its latest drug trial. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher this morning after experiencing significant volatility last week amid growing concerns about the possibility of an AI bubble. Stocks rose on Friday after a Federal Reserve official suggested support for an interest rate cut in December, but the three major indexes each posted big losses for the week. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.7% and 1%, respectively. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and will have an abbreviated trading session on Friday, but there are plenty of earnings reports and economic data in the next few days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs for all sorts of loans, was at 4.04% recently, down slightly from Friday's close and trading at its lowest level in nearly a month. Gold futures and crude oil futures were down slightly. Market participants now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate next month, after New York Fed President John Williams on Friday said that there may be "room for a further adjustment". Traders are now pricing in nearly a 75% cut at the Fed's Dec. 9-10 policy meeting, up from around 40% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data. The Fed trimmed its key fed funds rate at each of the past two meetings—in September and October—amid rising concerns about the health of the labor market. Fed officials recently have been divided in their views about whether another cut is warranted, amid ongoing concerns about inflationary pressure. Stocks tied to cryptocurrencies are gaining ground in premarket trading Monday, as bitcoin trades above the lows it hit at the end of last week. Bitcoin was at $86,000 recently, down from an overnight high of around $88,000 but up from Friday's level near $81,000, which was its lowest level since April. After trading as high as $125,000 in early October, the digital asset has tumbled in recent weeks as investor risk appetite waned amid concerns about the AI trade and uncertainty about the Fed's next move. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, were up nearly 2% recently. Shares of bitcoin miner Mara Holdings (MARA) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) were up nearly 3%. American officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are in Europe Monday for a new round of trade negotiations. Ahead of the meeting, European Union officials said that they did not expect to reach a deal to lower tariffs on steel and other goods in the first day of talks, per Bloomberg. As of their last agreement earlier this year, the U.S. currently has a 15% tariff on most goods coming into the country from the E.U., along with a 50% tax on a range of products made with steel and aluminum. Shares of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NVO) are down sharply this morning after the Ozempic maker's latest drug trial's results disappointed. The company had been looking to determine whether semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, could also slow the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. The trial's goal was to slow the decline by at least 20%, CNBC reported, but Novo Nordisk said Monday that although the drug did improve unspecified "biomarkers" related to Alzheimer's, it did not slow the progression of the disease itself. Analysts had been uncertain of how likely the trial was to achieve its goals, and about whether demand for Ozempic and Wegovy are still growing. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-traded shares were down more than 10% ahead of the opening bell.

Title: Crypto is getting punched in the face again—but this is no 2022

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. It’s getting ugly out there. On Friday, Bitcoin’s latest swoon saw it fall to $82,000, marking a drop of around 32% from its all-time high of $126,000. That high came just last month, but it now feels like a distant memory as exchanges liquidate over-leveraged traders, and retail buyers curse the day a cousin gave them that tip about Bonk coin. So just how much lower will prices drop? There’s a good chance that $82,000 is not the bottom. While prices have rallied in the last few days, with Bitcoin trading around $86,000 on Monday morning, it’s easy to envision scenarios where it drops to $70,000 or lower. A jolt of dour macro-economic news or a major scandal (more on that in a second), and we could be right back in Crypto Winter. As for how we got here, it’s pretty clear that Oct. 10 was the catalyst for the current malaise. That was the day that saw around $19 billion of forced liquidations—underscoring the perils that go with allowing crypto cowboys to leverage their positions by as much as 100x. That wipeout, in turn, spooked the many institutional investors that rushed into the sector amid the euphoria that came with President Donald Trump’s favorable regulatory policies. It turned out that it was just as easy for them to rush out again. The crypto industry’s painful financial month, one of its worst on record, is also bad for its already-tarnished reputation. Longtime haters will be keen to jump in with the familiar narrative that crypto is little more than a nest of fools and swindlers, and that it’s the Sam Bankman-Fried era all over again. That view, however, is mistaken. The crypto collapse of 2022, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $16,000, was indeed touched off by a wave of fraud. The villains included not only Bankman-Fried, but figures like stablecoin scammer Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky, who ran a “trusted” centralized platform for crypto deposits. Conversely, there is no major scandal driving crypto’s current woes—though we could, of course, see some nasty stuff get exposed if prices keep falling. All of this, though, can make it easy to overlook just how much bigger the crypto industry is today, and how much its underlying infrastructure has matured. Sure, some institutional investors have gotten cold feet about buying tokens, but there are a lot of very big names—think BlackRock and now Citadel Securities—which have made clear they are in for the long haul. The fact of the matter is that blockchain technology is simply superior to the legacy software that most of the financial system relies on, and Wall Street is ready for an upgrade. This process is just beginning, and it will ensure ongoing adoption of marquee crypto projects like Ethereum and Solana. It also won’t be long until DeFi systems become interwoven with the broader financial system. As my lawyer pal Marvin Ammori noted, the daily trading volume on the DeFi exchange Uniswap is equal to a month of trading volume on Kalshi, which is being treated as the hottest thing in town. The bottom line here is that crypto is taking its lumps right now, but things are not as bad as they seem. The downturn will serve to wash some of the worst grifters out of the industry, and force those left to step up and prove they are building something of value. This will happen but it could be a while before we see Bitcoin at $126,000 again. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Another TradFi convert: Citadel Securities, the market making giant owned by mega-billionaire Ken Griffin, is investing $200 million into Kraken. The deal suggests Citadel, which had previously avoided crypto, sees a future in tokenization. (Fortune) SPACs smacked: A bid by Pomp to take his DAT public through a reverse merger got rebuffed when the partner vehicle called off the deal on the grounds it was bad for shareholders. Other would-be crypto SPACs are also facing skepticism—a far cry from 2021 when the gimmick was widely used to enrich insiders at the expense of retail investors. (Bloomberg) Jamie debanks Jack: Strike CEO Jack Mallers complained on Twitter that JPMorgan Chase terminated his accounts over unspecified “concerning activity,” leading crypto figures Bo Hines to complain that the outspoken Bitcoin maxi had been debanked. (Decrypt) Dirty money bonanza: A major global news investigation found at least $28 billion worth of criminal funds from pig butchers, North Korean hackers and others have flowed into Binance, OKX and other exchanges in the last two years, in part from ask-no-question storefronts. (New York Times) DePIN drone network: The sector known as decentralized physical infrastructure has been in the dog house since the Helium debacle. Now a drone-tracking startup wants to build out its network by selling $949 sensors and paying out a new type of token for contributing to its network. Sure, but why not just use stablecoins instead? (Fortune) Former JPM exec and noted ‘permabull’ Tom Lee takes the main character crown this week for his bullish or perhaps delusional assurances that everything is great, even as his leading Ethereum DAT is badly underwater. Points for staying on message, Tom. The timeline is suddenly full of McDonald’s memes—a mainstay of bear markets as crypto bros joke about being so ruined they have to sling fries. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Saudi Aramco Weighs Raising Billions Of Dollars From Its Biggest Disposals Yet
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/saudi-aramco-weighs-raising-billions-of-dollars-from-its-biggest-disposals-yet
Time Published: 2025-11-24T12:28:49Z
Full Content:
Saudi Aramco is considering plans to raise billions of dollars by selling a range of assets, people familiar with the matter said, deals that could rank as its most significant disposals ever. The firm is weighing the sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals as part of the plans, the people said, declining to be identified as the information is confidential. Banks have been asked to pitch for roles on feasibility studies for the disposals, which could fetch more than $10 billion, they said. Aramco is eying options including raising fresh equity from the deal, the people said. It could also pursue a structure similar to the recent $11 billion lease transaction with a group led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners for assets linked to the Jafurah gas project, they said. That sale drew interest from firms around the world and bankers have since pitched several asset disposal plans given increasing demand from investors, one of the people said. Aramco’s terminals business is seen as a lucrative asset and the company could kick off a formal sales process as soon as early next year, the person said. At the same time, the oil giant is considering selling part of its real estate portfolio, some of the people said. Those assets will also likely be worth billions of dollars and will be seen as attractive at a time when the kingdom is advancing plans to allow foreign ownership. Discussions are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made. Representatives for Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Aramco’s main oil storage and export infrastructure is located at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and the company has similar terminals on the Red Sea. Internationally, the firm owns stakes in product terminals in the Netherlands and leases crude as well as product storage at main trade hubs in Egypt and at Okinawa in Japan. Oil prices have dropped by roughly a fifth this year and while that decline has somewhat been tempered by higher output, Aramco has delayed some projects and looked to sell assets to free up cash for investments. The deals now being considered would mark a step up from previous transactions that were focused on stakes in pipeline infrastructure. The world’s biggest oil exporter is a lynchpin of the Saudi economy. Revenue from energy sales and the firm’s hefty dividend payouts help support the kingdom’s expensive economic revamp, some elements of which have been hamstrung by growing costs. Meanwhile, Aramco is continuing to invest in big-ticket projects like Jafurah, which is set to start production this year and reach full capacity in 2030.

Company dividends are a crucial part of a stock’s total return. These ETFs track firms with strong records of quarterly payouts. The Daily Upside Staff squad@thedailyupside.com The old proverb that warns against judging a book by its cover dates at least to ancient Rome, and it applies to subjects far beyond its literal meaning, including investments. It’s easy for retail investors to grow mesmerized by the surface-level performance of hourly, daily or even annual, ups and downs of the market. While those shifts tell more than the cover story, it’s still only part of the story, and dividends can be another critical indicator of, and contributor to, value. Over the past century, payments comprising a portion of cash proceeds from operations have made up 31% of the S&P 500’s total return on a pro-forma basis, according to S&P Global Research. (The statistic includes hypothetical returns for some periods, since the index itself wasn’t created until 1957.) During some decades, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividends have made up more than half of returns, and thanks to the miracles of compounding, they can drive investors’ gains exponentially higher. Compound for Pound Including dividends, the S&P 500’s return from January 1930 to February 2025 would have been 9,584 points, compared with just 278 points excluding the payouts, according to the data. Investors seeking to take advantage of such multiples don’t have to find high-dividend stocks on their own: A number of exchange-traded funds offer simplified access. They’re not all created equal, however. The following list highlights six funds that pair attractive price-to-earning ratios with holdings known for dividend quality, ranked from lowest to highest. While there’s only one ETF on the market that focuses solely on dividend aristocrats, companies that have raised dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, each of the funds offers access to firms with a strong payout record: Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? Despite concerns ahead of the busiest season for retailers, projections show Americans are ready to open their wallets. Nvidia faced “the tough task of meeting high earnings expectations and high skepticism around AI capex,” per analysts at Bank of America. Bitcoin has so far fallen 20% from its 2025 peak this cycle; in previous bear markets, it fell as much as 30% to 40%. The cult hero/curiosity has launched a social media broadside against the AI trade that has fueled this year’s market rally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick warned of an equities drawdown on Tuesday at a summit in Hong Kong. Metsera on Tuesday called Novo Nordisk’s new $10 billion offer “superior” to rival Pfizer’s bid of $8 billion. The company has been one of the top beneficiaries of Trump administration policies, with US revenue climbing 68% year-over-year in Q2. Still in the “early innings of its growth story,” Robinhood has morphed from an app with crowdsourced stock advice to a financial ecosystem. Life is notoriously tough for those on the bottom rung of the Wall Street ladder, where weeks can stretch up to 100 hours. Disclosures by two regional lenders last week set off a mini-panic about bad loans on the books of small and medium cap banks. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Evoke phase 3 trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in Alzheimer's disease progression

November 24, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 24 November 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced the top-line results from the 2-year primary analysis of evoke and evoke+ phase 3 trials in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The two trials were randomised, double-blinded, enrolled a total of 3808 adults and evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide compared to placebo on top of standard of care. The decision to pursue an Alzheimer’s disease indication with semaglutide was based on real-world evidence studies, pre-clinical models as well as post-hoc analyses from diabetes and obesity trials. The evoke and evoke+ trials did not confirm superiority of semaglutide versus placebo in the reduction of progression of Alzheimer’s disease, as measured by the change in Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to baseline. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer’s disease-related biomarkers in both trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression. In the evoke trials with patients aged 55-85, suffering from mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, semaglutide appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with previous semaglutide trials. To date, more than 37 million patient-years of semaglutide exposure have occurred across diverse patient populations. “Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer’s disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide’s potential, despite a low likelihood of success. We are proud to have conducted two well-controlled phase 3 trials in Alzheimer’s disease that meet the highest standards of research and rigorous methodology,” said Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. “We sincerely thank all participants and their caregivers for their meaningful contributions. While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities.” The 1-year extension period in the evoke and evoke+ trials will be discontinued based on the efficacy results observed in the overall study population. Topline results from the evoke/evoke+ trials will be presented at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) conference on 3 December 2025, and full results at the 2026 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Conferences (AD/PD) in March 2026. About Alzheimer’s diseaseAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all dementia cases worldwide. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually worsen over time. Each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that can slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and reduce the overall burden on people affected and on society. About Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of BoxesThe Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) is a global measure of cognition and function obtained by interviewing both patient and care partner, commonly used staging tool for Alzheimer’s disease in research settings. It measures six areas covering cognition and function, where each area is scored between 0 (no dementia) and 3 (severe dementia). The summary score of the six areas (maximum score of 18), referred to as sum of boxes (CDR-SB) has been applied to clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease to track progression and assess disease severity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, the change in CDR-SB for semaglutide compared to placebo was measured from baseline to week 104. About the evoke/evoke+ studiesEvoke and evoke+ are large-scale trials investigating the disease-modifying potential of semaglutide in people with Alzheimer’s disease. They are global, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled confirmatory phase 3 trials investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg versus placebo in early-stage symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. The trials included men or women aged 55–85 years with MCI (defined as CDR global of 0.5) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (defined as CDR global score of 1.0) with confirmed amyloid positivity. In the evoke and evoke+ trials, 1,855 and 1,953 people respectively, were randomised 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo for 156 weeks (104-week main treatment phase and 52-week extension). About semaglutideSemaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist marketed under the brand names Ozempic® and Rybelsus® for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy® for the treatment of chronic weight management.

Title: Chatbots To Checkout: How AI And BNPL Are Rewriting Holiday Shopping

ByCatherine Erdly, Contributor. By the time peak holiday shopping deals land in inboxes this year, a lot of shoppers will already have a digital co-pilot. Some will be asking AI tools to shortlist gifts, while others will be planning Buy Now, Pay Later repayments before they ever hit “buy.” Christmas 2025 is shaping up to be the most digitally assisted festive season yet, with software influencing how people decide what to buy and how to pay for it. What’s new isn’t just the technology, but the way people are using it. Convenience, confidence, and control now sit at the center of the holiday journey. Shoppers are happy to let algorithms shoulder some of the work—as long as they keep their hands on the steering wheel. That appetite for digital backup isn’t hypothetical; it’s already showing up in the numbers. Checkout.com’s latest research finds that 46% of UK consumers would be open to using an AI agent to help with their Christmas shopping, and those who are interested would allow an average “trust threshold” of £200 for the AI to spend on their behalf. In fact, 42% of respondents admit to already using tools like ChatGPT for gift ideas. Jenny Hadlow, chief operating officer at Checkout.com, believes this could mark a real turning point. “Every year there’s a new trend shaping how we shop for Christmas, and this year, agentic AI could transform how we find, choose and buy our festive essentials,” she says. “The real potential of agentic shopping lies in its ability to navigate the vast landscape of options—comparing deals, scanning holiday sales, and optimising for the best consumer outcomes, from price to personal preference.” That doesn’t mean the concerns have disappeared though. Checkout.com’s research highlights fear of losing control, missing the personal touch, and worries about fraud and privacy as the main reasons people hesitate to let AI do more. When asked what would build trust, shoppers point to secure systems, easy returns and refunds, spending limits they can set themselves, and instant purchase alerts. In other words, they want AI to filter the noise and surface smarter choices—not to make opaque decisions in the background. Beyond fully “agentic” systems, AI is already reshaping how people research products long before they reach the checkout. Jen Pollard, Senior Analyst at Visualsoft, believes that generative AI shopping, like Shopify-ChatGPT Instant Checkout and Google AI search, “may have an early impact.” However, Pollard is hesitant to label this shopping season as “transformational” and is instead leaning more towards “experimental.” But Klaviyo takes a different stance, describing Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2025 as the first truly “AI-fueled” holiday shopping season. The company reports that more than half of consumers say they’ll use AI tools to compare deals or plan purchases. Instead of one frantic sales day, Klaviyo sees spending spread across a 16-day window that begins roughly 10 days before Black Friday. Shopify’s Global Holiday Retail Report points in a similar direction. The company finds that 64% of shoppers expect to use AI for at least one task in their holiday journey, while 88% of businesses are investing in AI-driven discovery tools. At the same time, 73% of consumers still value human interaction somewhere in the process. Even as more shoppers rely on AI tools and digital wallets, they still anchor decisions in trust, loyalty, and connection. Research from LoyaltyLion shows that 71% of Gen Z and Millenials say they feel more emotionally connected to brands through loyalty programs, while Antavo’s data suggests roughly seven in ten shoppers join those programs primarily for rewards, discounts, or cash back, with a meaningful share also motivated by personalized offers and perks like free shipping or early access. For smaller businesses, that blend of automation, loyalty, and humanity is particularly important. Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association, argues that artificial intelligence has moved from buzzword to practical tool. “AI is no longer a distant concept requiring huge investment or technical expertise,” he says. “It’s readily accessible, often affordable, and increasingly user-friendly. For independent retailers, this is transformative.” He also stresses that AI should sit alongside human service, not replace it. The strongest model is “AI plus human”: digital tools handle stock management, basic queries, and marketing, while staff focus on personalized service which keeps people coming back. If AI is changing how people decide what to buy, BNPL is quietly changing how they decide when and with what means to pay. Clearpay’s Festive Insights Wrapped report finds that more than a third of shoppers are planning to use BNPL this season to give them extra flexibility, with adoption strongest among Gen Z and Millennial consumers. Their motivations are mostly pragmatic. Clearpay reports that 63% of those who plan to use BNPL cite convenience as a key reason, 58% point to reliability, 52% to flexibility, and 51% to speed. Many shoppers are not trying to expand their overall budget; they are looking to smooth out the impact of big-ticket purchases or spread the cost of multiple family commitments over several paychecks. Rich Bayer, CEO at Clearpay, sees that as a defining pattern for 2025. “The festive season is always a special time, but 2025 brings fresh financial challenges for many households,” he says. “What we’re seeing is a pragmatic approach; people are still planning to celebrate, but they’re planning earlier, being practical with their budgets, prioritising self-care, and turning to tools like BNPL to help them manage their spending responsibly.” However, that pragmatism doesn’t eliminate risk. Used thoughtlessly, BNPL can still encourage overspending or lead to missed payments and fees. As BNPL becomes standard at checkout, retailers and providers will both be judged on how transparent they are with shoppers. This holiday season, AI, BNPL, and one-click checkout are no longer nice-to-haves; they’re must-haves as the modern-day consumer expects smart recommendations, flexible ways to pay, and a checkout that feels instant. But even still, shoppers gravitate toward brands they recognize, clear terms at checkout, and real humans when something goes wrong. The retailers that will stand out aren’t the ones with the flashiest tech, but the ones that combine digital speed with transparency, loyalty, and a human tone, making holiday shopping feel both effortless and genuinely worth returning to.

Title: Crypto treasuries facing $130 billion value reckoning as ETFs reshape market

EFT impact and "crypto-per-share" focus redefine corporate treasury strategies in the crypto market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investors long paid premiums for Digital Asset Treasury firms, seeing them as practical substitutes for holding Bitcoin when direct access was limited. That approach worked when regulated channels were scarce and corporate balance sheets offered the closest approximation to holding the asset itself. But according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the conditions that once supported those valuations have fundamentally changed. In a valuation framework released on Nov. 23, Hougan argued that the $130 billion sector now faces a structural shift. While the forces pushing DATs below the value of their crypto holdings, illiquidity, operating costs, and execution risk, are constant across the model, the factors that can lift valuations above parity are limited and uncertain. The natural state of a passive treasury, he wrote, is a discount. Hougan’s analysis challenges the assumptions that fueled the rise of companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet Inc., which built investment cases around holding large quantities of Bitcoin. His model treats spot-value parity as the starting point and subtracts three predictable valuation drags. The first is illiquidity. Bitcoin held inside a corporation cannot be redeemed directly by shareholders, and the friction between ownership and access typically results in a discount. Hougan described this gap as the price investors assign to delayed or constrained delivery of the underlying asset. The second is operating expense. Public companies incur recurring costs, including compensation, audits, custody arrangements, and legal services. Those expenses reduce net asset value on a continuous basis, meaning a dollar of Bitcoin held by a corporation is inherently worth less than a dollar held directly. The third is execution risk. Investors must account for the possibility that management will misallocate capital, misjudge markets, or face regulatory setbacks. Because the probability is non-zero, markets generally factor this risk into pricing. Hougan wrote: “Most of the reasons they should trade at a discount are certain and most of the reasons they might trade at a premium are uncertain…Expenses and risk compound over time.” Taken together, these factors form the baseline markdown that applies to most DAT structures before any upside levers are considered. The downward pressure on DAT valuations has intensified with the expansion of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds. Before ETF approvals, corporate treasuries served as the primary entry point for institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure without the custody complexity. That scarcity allowed some DAT stocks to trade well above their underlying holdings. The introduction of spot ETFs removed that structural advantage. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and other issuers now offer low-fee products that track Bitcoin and ETH directly, with intraday liquidity and daily creations and redemptions. Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth, called spot ETFs “DAT killers,” arguing that they closed the regulatory arbitrage that once justified premium pricing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that ETFs perform the same function as DATs “with good tracking,” providing cleaner exposure while avoiding the overhead of a corporate structure. He acknowledged that some institutions can hold only equities or bonds, which gives companies like MicroStrategy residual appeal. Still, he noted that this group is “not enough for a bunch of them to thrive.” With the premium model eroding, Hougan argues that a DAT’s valuation now depends on its ability to increase crypto per share. Only four strategies reliably support that objective: issuing debt to buy more crypto, lending assets for yield, using options strategies, and acquiring assets at a discount. Issuing debt is historically the most powerful tool, particularly when credit markets are favorable and Bitcoin is appreciating. If the asset consistently outperforms the interest burden, shareholders can achieve accretive gains. But the strategy relies on timing, balance-sheet strength, and access to capital markets. Lending, structured products, and options generate incremental returns but introduce counterparty or strategy risk. Mergers and acquisitions can increase scale, lowering financing costs and expanding the set of transactions a DAT can pursue. Hougan said “scale matters” because larger firms can access cheaper capital and better deal flow. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expects these pressures to accelerate consolidation. “We’re in the early innings of what DATs will become,” he said, predicting that surviving firms will evolve into operating companies that buy private crypto businesses and generate revenue rather than relying solely on treasury appreciation. Considering this, Hougan concluded: “Going forward, I think there will be more differentiation. A few will execute well and trade at a premium, and many will execute poorly and trade at a discount. This model is one way to think about which is which.” The move toward more disciplined valuation coincides with losses across Bitcoin treasury stocks. Research from 10X Research estimates that retail investors lost about $17 billion in recent months as markets repriced corporate holdings. The firm attributed these losses to the collapse of what it described as “financial alchemy,” where share issuance created the appearance of expanding upside until volatility erased the effect. Data from CryptoRank indicates sector-wide dispersion. Treasuries with high operating costs, limited scale, or large sell-side overhangs have underperformed, while firms focused on crypto-per-share expansion have been more resilient. Taken together, these shifts suggest that DATs must now compete directly with ETFs on cost, liquidity, and transparency. The period in which corporate balance sheets commanded automatic premiums is no longer supported by market structure. For the largest players, the challenge is proving they operate businesses rather than functioning as static balance-sheet vehicles. Firms that cannot offset expense drag or grow crypto-per-share are likely to trade at structural discounts, while those adopting active strategies may retain a valuation advantage. As ETFs capture a larger share of institutional flows, the market is sending a clear signal: simply holding Bitcoin is no longer enough. A DAT must demonstrate it can generate value beyond its treasury, or its equity will reflect the underlying arithmetic. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The hottest job on Wall Street right now isn't a trader or dealmaker. It belongs to the human minds who specialize in building the digital ones. Bank chiefs have been touting how adopting artificial intelligence at scale will help employees work smarter and cut costs, and they're putting serious money behind those AI ambitions. Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon said in October that he wished the firm's $6 billion annual tech budget was even higher, while Bank of America dedicated $4 billion this year to "new technology initiatives," according to the company. A chunk of that investment is directed at building out battalions of tech professionals to realize those strategies. However, the demand for that talent is driving salaries for technologists who specialize in AI — from rank-and-file engineers to executive and C-suite tech strategists — to soar at banks, according to insiders. "There's certainly not enough people" to keep pace with hiring demand, said recruiter Ryan Bulkoski, the global head of the AI, data, and analytics practice at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles. Recruiters and executives across financial services companies told Business Insider the result is a full-blown talent war pitting Wall Street banks against hedge funds, private asset managers, and Silicon Valley startups. The senior-level or C-suite AI leader who can steer corporate strategy "is the hottest job in the market" right now, forcing financial services firms to cough up "stretch offers," Chris Connors, a principal at the compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, told Business Insider. "If you are a high-caliber talent, you are more desirable than virtually every other role in the market," Connors added, noting that some firms have extended special, non-standard awards to lure top-tier talent or prevent them from leaving. Competition across the industry is fierce, as hedge funds and other asset managers have even issued incremental equity or long-term awards, Connors said — they often range from $500,000 to $1 million, typically vesting across three to four years. Some firms have offered "significant upfront sign-on grants," often in excess of $200,000, delivered off the bat as cash or equity, he said. For banks, especially, it has created a conundrum — how to extend big-ticket offers while adhering to their often rigid, standardized compensation bands. Hiring managers are forking over "some uncomfortable hiring packages" which are vaulting recipients into "a completely different stratosphere," Bulkoski explained, noting that top compensation packages for senior-level AI leaders are reaching the high seven- and even eight-figure range. "Nobody's leaving for less than 30%" pay increases if they're coming from companies where they're already "heads-down and doing well," he said. "No one's going to move for the historical 10, 15, or even 20% bump in compensation." AI hiring in the financial services industry grew in 2025 to 10 times its level at the start of January 2022, according to an analysis by workforce data provider Revelio Labs. To assemble the data, Revelio examined finance job postings for roles like "AI engineer," "machine learning engineer," and "computer vision engineer," among others. Six of the largest US banks — including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley — have collectively posted more than 2,000 AI roles in the past 12 months, Revelio's data showed. That surging demand for AI talent is driving paychecks higher. The average salary for AI professionals in finance, excluding C-suite roles, had risen to about $180,000 from $142,000 in 2020. That increase of more than 25% puts them on par with what conventional tech firms tend to pay for these roles, Revelio said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment. "What we have seen with banks over the past few years is they've had to really reframe and reimagine those comp ranges, especially for a lot of this type of talent," Ben Hodzic, head of North America at the recruiting firm Selby Jennings, told Business Insider. That's especially true as they're coming up against multistrategy hedge funds and high-frequency systematic trading firms that are "paying whatever they need to pay to get people," he said. But money alone isn't enough, insiders said. These technologists also want something else: power. Insiders said the AI race has elevated the voices of technology chiefs at banks and asset managers, giving them a perch at powerful tables that steer firms' overall strategy. Bulkoski said that, for prospective AI chiefs, wielding greater levels of influence in the boardroom alongside other C-suite leaders is an appealing prospect unto itself. "It could trump another number on the sheet," he said. The nature of the work is attracting a broad swathe of professionals eager to exploit the breach. "Go on LinkedIn and look at the number of people who just changed their title from data scientist to AI scientist," Bulkoski said. "It's kind of unbelievable." Candidates for senior-level roles are skewing younger, he continued. Some AI-savvy talent in their early- to mid-20s are pulling high-six to seven-figure offers, he said. To suss out who is a fit and who isn't, Bulkoski said his team assesses "whether they have a real track record" of constructing original AI or machine learning products at scale, and if they can channel that knowledge into creating commercial or operational value. "Most are in the early phases of developing executive maturity," he said, "but the best of them can already influence senior leaders by grounding every conversation in architecture, data, and measurable impact." With access to the board and stepped-up influence and responsibility, some Wall Street insiders are betting they can offer something Big Tech companies generally can't: a steadier, more clearly defined climb up the professional ranks. With tech firms consolidating and fears of an AI bubble mounting, recruiters say some technologists are increasingly drawn to the stability and hierarchy that the financial services industry is known for. "There's been a lot less volatility with jobs in the finance industry compared to the tech industry," said Selby Jennings' Hodzic, adding that finance offers a more well-worn, clearly defined pathway. He said Wall Street had been insulated from the kind of mass layoffs that have roiled Big Tech. Amazon, for instance, cut about 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025. Recruiters say the flames fanning the talent war aren't dissipating anytime soon, and that the next phase of the hiring race is already underway. "In 2025, it's almost like Gen AI is in the past," Bulkoski said. "We're actually now working on searches that have 'agentic AI' in the title." Jump to

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature” — Max Planck Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with an essay by SEPP director David Legates rebutting a claim that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. TWTW discusses a version of uncertainty proposed by John Ridgway. TWTW discusses Ross McKitrick’s paper of a statistically acceptable way of climate fingerprinting. Then, TWTW discusses an essay and a speech by two commentators on UK energy policy. TWTW closes with an effort by the UNFCCC to impose censorship. ********************* General Patterns v. Specific Details: NOAA research scientist Nadir Jeevanjee claims that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. As evidence, he offers five forecasts for which the early simple models in a lab of the U.S. Weather Bureau were accurate. The laboratory became the NOAA-financed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton. Jeevanjee claims that the report by five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D., Judith Curry, Ph.D., Steven Koonin, Ph.D., Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) published by the Department of Energy in July 2025 claimed that the complexity of current global climate models as the primary reason why the models cannot be trusted. Jeevanjee gave five major examples why current models can be trusted. Writing for the Cornwall Alliance, climatologist David Legates rebutted each example. As posted in WUWT, Legates states [the graph is not shown here but is in the text, boldface added]: Okay, let’s revisit history—because those who can’t remember history correctly are destined to get it wrong. First, we need to get one fact correct. The recent Department of Energy report did not simply cite the complexity of climate models as the primary reason they cannot be trusted. It goes into detail as to why current climate models cannot be trusted: namely, they cannot reproduce current conditions. For example, models are not capable of determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. As shown in this graph from the DOE report, they tend to ‘run hot,’ or overstate surface warming. [graph not shown here] They also overstate warming of the tropical troposphere, and their simulation of stratospheric cooling is inconsistent. With regards to the tropical troposphere, the excessive warming was noted as a problem in the first United States National Climate Assessment and has been noted in every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report since. This problem has become more extreme over time—i.e., simulations from later models, despite decades of ‘improvements’ costing billions of dollars, deviate farther from observations than earlier models—and its spatial extent now encompasses the entire globe. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. It concludes, ‘it is this track record of success that gives us confidence in interpreting the changes we’re seeing now, as well as predicting changes to come.’ It then lists five forecasts the early models made that underscore how well even those early models could reproduce Earth’s climate. Now, let’s give credit where credit is due, but let’s not reward models for getting the basics of climate correct. In other words, models should not be praised for figuring out that the Poles are cold and the Equator is warm. They should not be given credit for simulating the Hadley Cell circulation or demonstrating that oceans have a moderating effect on climate, for examples. These basic premises of climate are obvious and must have been a product of the simulation; otherwise, the models would have been discarded before they were even published. So, let’s test the article’s evaluation of the models. Forecast number 1: early models correctly simulated surface global warming from increased carbon dioxide. Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise. Way back in 1896, Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) showed that an increase in carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures. The question always has been, and still is, how much should the temperature rise from, say, a doubling of carbon dioxide? Early models argued that the temperature rise would be between 2.0 and 3.5 degrees Celsius. These numbers are actually closer to reality than estimates provided by later model simulations, but they are still higher than data-driven estimates using historical and paleoclimate data. Verdict? Early models would have been discarded if they had simulated cooling or had no effect. That they simulated warming from increased greenhouse gases is no proof of their reliability. Forecast number 2: the models predicted stratospheric cooling from adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This should also have been relatively obvious. If outgoing terrestrial radiation is being intercepted by more carbon dioxide at the surface, and some of it is radiated back to the surface, then less will reach the stratosphere and, consequently, the stratosphere should cool. Again, the question that demands an answer is, ‘How much cooling?’—and even current climate models cannot simulate this correctly or consistently. Forecast number 3: Arctic amplification. The Conversation suggests that it was surprising that the early models accurately predicted that rising carbon dioxide concentrations would warm the Arctic more than the Tropics. But that was no surprise at all. Given a warming planet, the Arctic will warm faster than the Equator due to six factors. Therefore, a greater warming of the Arctic was obvious to climatologists even before the first climate model was created. That models simulate it is no big feat. Forecast number 4: land-ocean contrast. The article notes that the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ‘led to a slew of insights, including the observation that land generally warms more than ocean, by a factor of about 1.5.’ While this may sound impressive to the uninitiated, climatologists have long known the moderating effect of the oceans, again due to their high specific heat. Consider San Diego and Dallas, at about the same latitude of 33 degrees north. The annual temperature range in San Diego is about 8 degrees Celsius, while that in Dallas is about 22 degrees—a factor of almost three. Extending any transect to both coasts indicates that the annual temperature range—and the diurnal temperature range, for that matter—increases with distance from the coast. To anyone who understands the Earth’s climate, the central Plains have a much greater temperature range than either coast, for example. So, why would this have been a novel finding back in 1979? Any competent climatologist would have known this, so it must have been a basic component of any climate model worth its salt at the time. Forecast number 5: delayed warming of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. This issue arises from the supposedly novel fact that the Arctic has a greater warming signal than that of the Southern Ocean. But why is that surprising? The change in albedo is not as great in Antarctica, since there is little land area exposed by melting snow and ice, while there is much in the Arctic. Sea ice dynamics differ considerably in the Southern Hemisphere, and the loss of sea ice isn’t as dramatic to warming Antarctica. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is bounded by a hemisphere of ocean, which has a moderating effect on the climate as mentioned earlier. Thus, important contributions to Arctic warming are not present in the Southern Ocean, and so we would have expected the Southern Ocean to be different from the Arctic. The take-home message? If early climate models missed any of these supposed climate novelties, climate modeling wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. What early climate modeling showed was that the basics of climate could be replicated with simple mathematical approximations. But that’s the basics. The details are that climate is still very complex, and while the general patterns can be simulated accurately, specific details as to how climate varies spatially and how it is likely to change under various scenarios are still a far-off challenge. The article concludes: ‘Climate models have their limitations, of course. For instance, they cannot predict regional climate change as well as people would like. But the fact that climate science, like any field, has significant unknowns should not blind us to what we do know.’ I agree, but I would also note that we were not blind to these facts before the advent of climate models. Syukuro Manabe deserves credit for demonstrating that the basics of climate can be reproduced with a rudimentary computer program run on early computers. But the fact remains that current model simulations still deviate significantly from real-world observations. And let’s not lose sight of the fact that early climatologists understood quite a bit about how the Earth’s climate works. Yes, there were climatologists before the climate modelers, and they knew an awful lot about the Earth’s climate. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Uncertainty: As David Legates writes above, the global climate models are highly inconsistent and generally greatly overestimate the warming of the atmosphere. Modelers often dismiss criticism of the inconsistency and the overestimate as the result of “initial conditions.” If the initial conditions are accurate, part of the inconsistency in modeling results can be attributed to initial conditions, but the overestimates may be from the use of the wrong data to detect the greenhouse effect. In two essays posted on Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. and one in Climate Scepticism (English spelling) John Ridgway addresses the issues of uncertainty. In the second essay posted in Climate Etc. “Natural Selection of Bad Science. Part II,” Ridgway discusses “Distinguishing Two Dimensions of Uncertainty” by Craig Fox and Gülden Ülkümen. The issues arise from the fact that modeling is not measurement and the efforts to attach probability estimates on a range of modeling results are without any foundation in classical probability and statistics. For example, if modelers state the results are a of range of 1.5 – 4.5°C, they don’t have a sound statistical basis for attaching probabilities to these estimates. In a long post on Curry’s website, Ridgway address this issue and efforts to minimize it. He states: “…the problem didn’t go away, and we now live in a world where it is common practice for climate scientists to confuse epistemic and aleatory uncertainty by trying to treat the spread of model outputs as if dealing with a measurement problem that can be characterized using probability distributions. It’s possible that some climate scientists are simply unaware of the issue, but many others deliberately ignore it because they recognize the expedience of pretending that the epistemic uncertainties involved can be analyzed as if they were aleatory.” [Boldface added.] Here Ridgway introduces terms that may be from philosophy: “epistemic uncertainties” and “aleatory uncertainties.” Epistemic uncertainty arises for a lack of knowledge (incomplete understanding in a model) and possibly could be resolved by gathering more data or better data. Aleatoric uncertainty arises because of the unpredictable, random nature of the physical system (randomness and noise). This uncertainty cannot be resolved by more and better data. The distinction is useful because it may be helpful to address issues that arise when global climate modelers dismiss criticisms of the inconsistency of their work as resulting from “initial conditions.” For example, turbulence is a vexing problem in fluid dynamics that no one has solved. Turbulence can be considered an aleatory uncertainty, it is random. In climate modeling, turbulence will produce different results with different initial conditions. However, the use of surface-air temperature data for modeling is not an aleatory uncertainty. It is the wrong data to use if one is forecasting the influence of greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere. Further, surface-air data is subject to many other human influences that have no relationship with greenhouse gases, such as the urban heat island effect, roadways, runways, landscape changes, etc. The variation between surface-air temperature trends and atmospheric temperature trends cannot be dismissed as aleatory uncertainty, random. The differences are epistemic, lacking appropriate knowledge. Yet the appropriate knowledge exists but is ignored by the global climate modeling community. There is no justification for saying the difference is the result of initial conditions. Under Problem number 1: The converted meteorologist in “More on the Uncertainty Monster” Ridgway writes: “’Internal variability, part of the natural variability of the climate system, can be estimated from high-resolution simulators, but it is only a tiny part of total uncertainty. Over centurial scales, it is negligible compared to our combined uncertainty of the behavior of the icesheets, and the marine and terrestrial biosphere.’ As a consequence, the road to improved forecasting is markedly different for the two challenges. For meteorology, improvement is traditionally gained by using simulations of greater fidelity and granularity, powered by extra computer and physical perturbation ensembles of increasing size. For climate science, the solution lies more in gaining a greater understanding of the complexities and feedbacks involved and how they operate in the long term. The distinction is essentially that which exists between variability and incertitude, and hence between the aleatory and epistemic approaches. However, there is always a danger that an individual steeped in the traditions of the former may not be able to fully adjust when engaged in the latter. If Monte Carlo simulations and similar stochastic sampling techniques have proved immensely effective within their realm, the temptation might be to believe that the realm of the epistemic could be similarly tamed. One individual who may fit this description is Professor Tim Palmer, an academic who has done as much as anyone in pioneering and finessing the techniques that underpin modern-day weather forecasting. In his book, The Primacy of Doubt, these successes are described in chapters such as ‘Chaos, Chaos Everywhere,’ ‘The Geometry of Chaos,’ ‘Noisy, Million-Dollar Butterflies’ and ‘The Two Roads to Monte Carlo.’ However, in the chapter ‘Climate Change,’ he states the following when discussing climate change multi-model ensembles: ‘This provides a natural ‘ensemble of opportunity’ to study climate change. It is an example of the so-called multi-model ensemble mentioned in Chapter 5. Each model differs from the others in the precise computational techniques used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, and, more importantly, in the parameterization formulae for unresolved processes.’ There is nothing in the above to suggest that the aleatory sampling techniques he had described in Chapter 5 (Monte Carlo simulation) are anything other than fully applicable to the ensembles he now describes. And yet, Chapter 5 was predominantly about the modelling of variability, whereas now we have moved on to matters of incertitude, as characterized by models of varied structure. Just to reinforce the suspicion that Palmer sees nothing wrong with the adoption of aleatory methods to treat such epistemic uncertainty, on page 121 he reproduces a histogram showing the various estimates of climate sensitivity resulting from an ensemble of differently structured models. Over this he fits a probability distribution curve, seemingly unconcerned that this takes no account of the histogram’s decidedly non-stochastic representation of the space of possible model structures. This is precisely the normative practice to which I have referred above, and yet there is no hint in his book that he sees it as a pragmatic (albeit sub-optimal) expedient, or as a probabilistic treatment adopted only for the benefit of the policymakers. Indeed, he goes on to justify its legitimacy by reference to the concept of the ‘wisdom of the crowds.’ But this is a concept that only applies when the crowd acts entirely independently and is statistically representative. Of course, neither of these conditions apply to the currently available ‘crowd’ of climate models.” Ridgway identifies a major problem with the ensemble method advocated by Tim Palmer and widely used today – the method mixes different types of uncertainties some of which can be resolved with better data while others cannot. Additionally, Palmer writes some ideas of what his technique can resolve that are farfetched. Ridgway writes: “Armed with an ensemble of such models, Palmer sees great potential in tackling the epistemic uncertainties appertaining to our shared future: ‘Of course, such a digital ensemble twin would not only be able to tackle the socioeconomic problems of climate geoengineering, it should be able to provide credible estimates of future migration, future conflict, future health risks, future food supplies, the future health of the oceans and so on.’ Of course? It is far from obvious to me that a reliable ‘model of global society’ can be created by extending a stochastic model designed to forecast the outcome of a system’s variability.” Under “Problem number 2: The denial of subjectivity” Ridgway writes about “Personalist” interpretation of uncertainty that has no bearing in physical science. Physical science deals with verifiable, objective properties independent from one’s individual beliefs. The essays are useful in identifying types of uncertainties, some of which may reduce with more data or the use of appropriate data. Other uncertainties, such as turbulence, probably cannot be reduced even with better and faster computers. The knowledge does not exist. Additionally, our understanding of the formation and dissipation of clouds is lacking. For Ridgway’s essays, see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and for aleatoric uncertainty see https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/aleatoric-uncertainty ********************* Climate Fingerprinting: Ridgway discusses Extreme Event Attribution (EEA) where probabilities are assigned that increasing carbon dioxide (global warming) increases the probability of a particular event (usually a natural disaster) occurring. Earlier, Allen and Tett (1999) claimed that the work satisfied the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem and the estimates are BLUE, [the Best (minimum variance), Linear, Unbiased, Estimator] for the calculation of the coefficient of the desired variable. Writing in the same Journal, Climate Dynamics, Ross McKitrick (2022) showed that the method did not produce BLUE results; the results were not unbiased and consistent estimates of the desired coefficient. A major problem is the lack of consistency of the error term, heteroscedasticity. In discussing Ross McKitrick’s latest work, John Robson writes: “A lot of observers including us have long suspected that the IPCC’s knack for always finding CO2 responsible for everything was probably an artifact of dodgy statistical practice rather than real-world effects. [Ross] McKitrick’s new analysis confirms our suspicions and adds to the evidence that in the real world outside climate models CO2 is not the control knob on global climate and natural variability matters a lot more than we’ve been told. And confirms our suspicions that far from being ‘settled,’ rigorous and, oh yeah, ‘simple,’ climate science neglects basic tools of the trade from the statistical to the testing of hypotheses to try to disprove them not to confirm them at all costs.’ See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* In the Mire: In “Fixing the electricity system” Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch addressed a main problem in the UK – the high and increasing cost of electricity to consumers and industry. His essay begins with [boldface added]: “The UK has the highest industrial electricity prices in the developed world, despite paying only average prices for gas. Independent research shows that years of high energy costs have made the cost-of-living voters’ top concern, fueling public anger and political polarization. Yet even sceptics of the renewables agenda often misunderstand the core problem. Cutting subsidies alone will not lower prices. As Octopus Energy and E.ON told Parliament’s Energy Security and Net Zero Committee, even if gas prices halved or fell to zero, electricity bills would still rise. But why? The reason lies in so-called ‘non-commodity costs’ – the cost of managing a grid rather than of generating the power. Because renewables are weather-dependent, spatially diffuse, and often located far from where power is needed, and moreover because they undermine the economics of the gas-fired fleet – vital for when the wind is not blowing – these costs are soaring. Energy experts, including Professors Dieter Helm and Gordon Hughes, have argued that such system costs are now the main driver of bills and – unlike with thermal power systems – will keep rising as more renewables are added. Cancelling subsidies might bring short-term relief, but, as long as intermittent generation grows, balancing and capacity market costs will escalate. Britain cannot reduce the cost of living, revive productivity, or restore economic growth without fixing its electricity system. To do this, UK politicians must confront not only subsidies, but the physical and contractual structures that make energy permanently expensive.” Energy consultant Kathryn Porter had a similar, grim question “How do we keep the lights on with 12 GW net firm capacity at risk of retirement by 2030?” in a speech to the Institution of Power Engineers. Paul Homewood summarizes key points with: “A total of 56 GW, facing peak winter demand of 48 GW. That capacity cannot be guaranteed 24/7, so 50 GW is more realistic. Moreover that 7 GW of batteries, plus 2.7 GW of pumped storage can only supply for an hour or so – enough to meet peak demand, but worthless for longer periods. As a result, we are already totally dependent on imported power at the times when wind power cannot meet demand. But the real value of Kathryn’s analysis is that she has identified how much gas power capacity we could potentially lose in the next few years. Not only is 12 GW at risk of closure by 2030, but another 6 GW could go by 2035.” See links under Questioning European Green. ********************* Literacy Through Censorship: The 30th Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) concluded November 21, a new threat has emerged to modern civilization – UN censorship. Jo Nova links to a November 12 UN press release that states: “The Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change today launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, establishing shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues. The Declaration commits signatories to promote the integrity of information related to climate change at international, national, and local levels, in line with international human rights law and the principles of the Paris Agreement. Drafted in collaboration with civil society members of the Global Initiative Advisory Group, the Declaration has been endorsed by ten countries so far – Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Uruguay. ‘Climate change is no longer a threat of the future; it is a tragedy of the present,’ said President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Belém. ‘We live in an era in which obscurantists reject scientific evidence and attack institutions. It is time to deliver yet another defeat to denialism.’” Charles Rotter has additional views on the subsequent: “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change.” See links under Censorship. ********************* Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year. A paper in Nature Communications, Earth & Environment states: Over the past three decades, satellites have provided continuous, accurate measurements of sea level on near-global scales. Here, we show that since satellites began observing sea surface heights in 1993 until the end of 2023, global mean sea level has risen by 111 mm. In addition, the rate of global mean sea level rise over those three decades has increased from ~2.1 mm/year in 1993 to ~4.5 mm/year in 2023. If this trajectory of sea level rise continues over the next three decades, sea levels will increase by an additional 169 mm globally, comparable to mid-range sea level projections from the IPCC AR6. The reported satellite estimates are inconsistent with tidal gauge measurements taken at geological stable locations. Ole Humlum reports: “Tide gauges along coasts indicate a typical global sea level increase of about 1-2 mm/yr. Coastal sea level change rate last 100 year has essentially been stable, but with periodic variations.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science.

[SEPP Comment: Regulators have labeled isolated land (no running water) with a perched water table (a layer of saturated soil that forms above the main water table due to an impermeable layer) as “Navigable Waters of the United States.”] Trump proposes to narrow Endangered Species Act protections By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 19, 2025 “If these rules had been in place back in the 1970s, the bald eagle, the gray whale might not be around today, and if they go into effect now, they will drive animals extinct, and that means a lonelier world,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity. [SEPP Comment: The comment is bunk. In the 1970s there were plenty of bald eagles in British Columbia and Alaska.] Energy Issues – Non-US American-Japanese Pact Signals Ascent of Energy Realism By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Nov 18, 2025 Britain faces threat of blackouts from ‘nuclear planning paralysis’ By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 21, 2025 It’s a bit late to panic now! There is only one answer to the problem of looming blackouts – begin immediately on a large-scale rollout of new CCGT power stations. If we do that, of course, there is no economic value in building any further wind and solar capacity, so AR7 and future CfD rounds need to be cancelled. Labour net zero levies now main driver of rising energy bills By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 18, 2025 It’s Official–Mad Miliband’s Plan Will Push Up Electricity Prices By £265 A Year By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 20, 2025 Energy Issues – Australia The $16B Quest for a Spine By Alan Moran, Quadrant, Nov 15, 2025 UN tells Australia (but not China) that digging up our own gas might be a breach of “international law” By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Nov 15, 2025 The UN, which we fund for some reason, is telling us we can’t drill for gas on our land and are being very naughty. They’ve sent a Special Rapporteur, Astrid Puentes Riano, to join three cases in Federal Courts in an amicus curiae role. She is here to cast a spell and see if she gets lucky and scores some shake-down-money in reparations. It was only a few months ago the International Court of Climate Justice (ICJ) declared that nice weather was a “human right”, thus supposedly allowing the whole world to sue everyone else, ad infinitum for bad weather. Energy Issues — US Rising Electricity Prices: The Missing Link By Jonathan Lesser, Real Clear Energy, Nov 20, 2025 The reality is that many factors are contributing to rising electricity rates, especially the rapid increases that households and businesses have experienced over the last five years. But the various studies have overlooked a key factor: the changing mix of generating resources, as traditional fossil fuel and nuclear plants have been replaced by wind and solar ones. When Energy Is Done Right, a Rising Tide Will Lift All Boats By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Nov 18, 2025 As China launches an AI Manhattan Project, US AI Support is buckling under High Energy Prices By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 Developing the technology alone is not enough. The USA didn’t start the current AI push. The University of Toronto developed the critical breakthrough which made the current AI revolution possible in 2012. But aside from some Canadian islands of research excellence, Canada is not a serious player in the AI race. Canada’s obsession with green energy and moribund economy gave the USA the edge – an edge the USA is now in danger of losing to China. Amping Up Datacenter Demagoguery re: Rising Electricity Costs By Paul Steidler, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 Energy Department reorganizes, a move it says will help it align with Trump priorities By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 20, 2025 Link to old organizational chart: Department of Energy By Staff, DOE, Sep 3, 2022 Click to access DOE_Organization_Chart.pdf Link to new organizational chart: Department of Energy By Staff, DOE, Nov 20, 2025 Click to access Organization-Chart-11.20.2025-2.pdf An organizational chart released to the public no longer lists the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. According to the department, this office will be renamed as the newly established Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. Legalize Natural Gas! (New York Gov. Hochul gets a message) By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 19, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Who knows? Someday New York politicians may decide it is time to use the vast quantities of natural gas under their feet in the Marcellus shale in western New York?] At The New York Krazy Klimate Konference, 2025 Edition By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Nov 20, 2025 Washington’s Control of Energy Trump proposes to open up new drilling off California coast and in eastern Gulf By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 20, 2025 President Trump’s proposal greatly expands offshore drilling plans in general, proposing to hold as many as 34 offshore oil and gas lease sales between the years 2026 and 2031. It would replace a Biden administration-era plan that proposed just three offshore lease sales, all in the Gulf of Mexico, between the years 2024 and 2029. Nuclear Energy and Fears A Nuclear Resurgence, But Major Obstacles Remain By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, Nov 20, 2025 Artificial intelligence needs 24-hour, 7-day, always-on power, which intermittent wind and solar can’t provide. Companies that have committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions view nuclear as a zero-emissions source to power AI. Today, natural gas is the preferred onsite electricity source for new data centers in the US. Over 200 gas-fired power plants are in planning or under construction nationwide, including more than 100 new gas plants in Texas alone. Trump administration issuing $1B loan to bolster Three Mile Island restart By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 18, 2025 Fusion Energy Is Happening Now: The Global Race to Commercialization By Brian Babin, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Brian Babin. [SEPP Comment: Where is fusion energy being consistently generated?] Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Research Group: U.S. Exits Coal by 2040 as Solar, Nuclear, Natural Gas Surge By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, Nov 18, 2025 Link to: Energy in Focus 2025 Outlook Report Your free guide to navigating the North American and international energy landscape in 2025. By Dane Gregoris, et al., Enverus Intelligence® Research, 2025 From report: 2025 Will Be the Year of DAC, EVS and Advanced Nuclear Reactors From Proctor: EIR said installed U.S. power capacity is forecast to grow 57% by 2050, with the next quarter-century defined by three eras: rapid solar energy growth (2025–2035), coal replacement (2035–2040), and steady nuclear expansion (2040–2050). [SEPP Comment: Appears to be a promo piece. Question continuation of “rapid solar energy growth” and DAC (direct air capture of carbon dioxide and subsequent storage).] Solar’s Next Chapter: Beyond Incentives By Fox Swim, Power Mag, Nov 16, 2025 The ITC [Investment Tax Credit] may be coming to an end, but the momentum it created endures. The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way. Renewable energy is cheaper and healthier – so why isn’t it replacing fossil fuels faster? By Jay Gulledge, The Conversation, Nov 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation. [SEPP Comment: Another professor who does not understand the importance of reliability in modern society.] Sunnova: Autopsy of a ‘Green’ Failure By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Nov 18, 2025 Led by the toothy Enron-ex John Berger (who made millions of dollars at the expense of just about everyone else, including taxpayers), Sunnova is yet another case study of business failure under political capitalism (versus free-market capitalism). Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles Ever Diminishing Vehicles We’re winning so hard, it hurts By JIT, Climate Scepticism, Nov 18, 2025 [Bernie Kepshire] The final figure shows the total car production in the UK, as reported by the SMMT, whether for domestic supply or export, by month. I think I see a trend there. If you put a line through the data since the ZEV [Zero-Emissions Vehicle mandate] began, the slope is -6500 cars per month per year. That puts the UK car industry as extinct by 2035. Health, Energy, and Climate Counting the Dead: Media Drama Warps Reality By Chuck Dinerstein, MD,, ACSH, Nov 14, 2025 Link to article: Does the news reflect what we die from? What do Americans die from, and what do the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News report on? By Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, Our World in Data, Oct 6, 2025 From Dinerstein: The data exposes a sobering truth: the media landscape no longer reflects the statistical reality of the world but the emotional reality of what captures attention. Headlines reflect not the greatest dangers to our lives, but the strongest reactions of our hearts When the media amplifies the rare and sensational, it warps our collective sense of risk, steering fear and policy toward the exceptional instead of the everyday. From Hype to Evidence: Rethinking Microplastic Pollution in Our Foods By Chuck Dinerstein, MD, ACSH, Nov 17, 2025 Public concern about microplastics has grown rapidly—often outpacing the evidence. The European Food Safety Agency’s comprehensive review shows that while microplastics can indeed be released from food contact materials, the quantities are far lower than many early studies suggested, and most data on nanoplastics are still unreliable or missing altogether. Much of the apparent risk has been amplified by inconsistent testing methods, contamination, and the misidentification of non-plastic residues as plastic particles. This does not mean we should dismiss the issue. It means we should keep it in proportion. The science to date tells us that microplastic release from everyday packaging is a real but limited phenomenon, not a looming public health crisis. A healthy dose of reality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Like those at the Globe & Mail who just wrote “For the health of Canadians, the health care sector must decarbonize now”. Right, that’s the priority. Millions of Canadians have no family doctor, and the population faces some of the world’s longest waits for essential surgeries. Other News that May Be of Interest The Congressional Minerals Mandate By Rich Nolan, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 Why the chemtrail conspiracy theory lingers and grows – and why Tucker Carlson is talking about it By Calum Lister Matheson, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Conspiracies are dramatic and exciting, with clear lines of good and evil, whereas real life is boring and sometimes scary. The chemtrail theory is ultimately prideful. It’s a way for theorists to feel powerful and smart when they face things beyond their comprehension and control. Conspiracy theories come and go but responding to them in the long-term means finding better ways to embrace uncertainty, ambiguity and our own limits alongside a new embrace of the tools we do have; logic, evidence and even humility. BELOW THE BOTTOM LINE Satellite-Borne Mirrors Would Light Up the Skies at Night to Boost Solar Power By Bonner Russell Cohen, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 The orbital dynamics of rapidly moving satellites — orbiting the Earth at a speed of 4.7 miles per second — further undermine the efficiency of “sunlight on demand.” “To a static location on the ground, as computed by astronomers Michael J. I. Brown and Matt Kenworthy, that means each satellite will be within 1000 km [621 miles] of a given location on the ground for no more than 210 seconds (or 3.5 minutes) per orbit,” Siegel adds. “And you’d need thousands of them, all reflecting sunlight to the same location on the ground, to generate any power at all.” COP30 On Fire! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 20, 2025 Video Doctors dance at COP30 to demand a fossil fuel phase-out Video from AP, Via WUWT, Nov 19, 2025 A group of Canadian doctors danced to hip-hop at the U.N. climate talks in Brazil, calling for a global phase-out of fossil fuels. They say clean energy isn’t just a climate issue, it’s a public health one. Friday Funny: COPs 1-30 – A perfect record of failure By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 ARTICLES NO ARTICLES THIS WEEK Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe “Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise.” Conclusion by inference. About as basic a violation of the scientific method as is possible, Sorry David, but in Immediately conceding the central ground of the dispute, the plot has been lost Some here may not forgive me the analogy, but what was done here is as though an atheist in a dispute began with, ‘yeah, the bible is true, but …’ One should study David Dibbell’s video showing the ERA5 Reanalysis Energy Conversion in the Atmosphere, to gain the critical view of increased carbon dioxide. Spoiler alert: the energetic impact of all emitted CO2 is about 10% of the width of the zero-tick, in a energy-dynamic traversing (+/-)10,000 W/m^2. The climatological effect of CO2 is revealed to be indistinguishable from zero. And climate model uncertainty? The physical theory deployed in climate models is critically deficient. A model tuned to speciously reproduce a warming trend will successfully extrapolate the future trend so long as the trend continues. Empirical extrapolations are not predictions in any scientific sense. As Chris Essex long ago noted, tuned parameters are ad hoc conservation laws that have no basis in physics. They impose climate stasis. Ad hoc laws and deficient theory make both simulations of future climate and air temperature projections themselves physically meaningless, no matter model statistical skill in extrapolation. The models are utterly unreliable – a fact already known. Pace David, but in hard ball, one doesn’t concede a home run. Thanks, Pat – I had the exact same issue with Dave’s analysis of ‘Forecast number 1’ last week: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/11/19/just-how-good-were-the-early-climate-models/#comment-4133138 Thanks right back, Frank. So far as I can see, your view is dead-on. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. That is much like claiming that a Volkswagen has an acceleration identical to a Ferrari. It is a qualitative assessment recognizing that both can gain speed over time, but purposely ignores that the quantitative increases over time are very dissimilar. Qualitatively, they share a positive slope; however, quantitatively the accelerations are very different. Alarmists commonly wave their arms around to attract attention, but then fail to provide measurements to support their claims. It is said that mathematics is the language of science. Innumerate claims supported only by poorly-defined ‘lawyer words’ demonstrate that the claims are not supported by science. Something cannot be right and wrong at the same time. One or the other must be right, not both at the same time. The defining characteristic of a change like warming is the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time, which is the instantaneous change defined as the slope or the tangent to the temperature function at a particular time. I would submit that “early climate model forecasts” were not correct. Some were so wrong quantitatively as to be absurd. To claim that they all were correct suggests that those making such a claim never took a calculus class. The collection of early forecasts, all being quite different, serves to prove that nobody knew what they were talking about, even as late as 1988 when Hansen produced several different scenarios, all giving different results based on different assumptions. The only conclusion justified by the qualitative claims is that Earth has been warming for about 20,000 years and will probably continue to for at least a similar length of time. However, quantitatively, warming 1 degree C over the next century is not the same as warming 10 or 20 degrees in the same amount of time. It is sophistry to suggest that they are the same. Xeno’s Paradox has similarly been proven to be illogical by calculus. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

November 24, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. NEW YORK, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide Inc. (“WeRide” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: WRD, HKEX:0800), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Financial and Operational Highlights Global Commercialization - Robotaxis Tier-1 Cities, China Abu Dhabi, UAE Zurich, Switzerland Other Global Cities Global Commercialization – Other L4 Product Lines One-Stage End-to-End L2+ Solutions Management Commentary Tony Han,WeRide's Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In 3Q 2025, WeRide's regulatory and commercial achievements spanning eight countries demonstrated the convergence of advanced technology and global execution capabilities. We've achieved a number of significant milestones, most notably securing the fully driverless commercial robotaxi permit in Abu Dhabi, with our operations there soon reaching unit economics breakeven, a critical milestone that validates our path to profitability at scale. As we progress toward our goal of deploying hundreds of thousands of robotaxis by 2030, WeRide is well-positioned to capitalize on the autonomous driving opportunity. The depth of our technology stack, breadth of our global partnerships, and strength of our regulatory relationships position us to capture significant value as autonomous mobility transforms transportation worldwide.” Jennifer Li, WeRide’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of International, added, “Our Q3 financial performance represents substantial improvement in both growth trajectory and operational leverage. Revenue reached RMB171.0 million, representing 144.3% year-over-year growth, while the 761.0% increase in robotaxi revenue provides strong validation of our technology from both third parties and end users. Our diversified portfolio across products, services, and geographies continues to provide multiple avenues for sustained growth. Our gross margin expansion to 32.9% demonstrates our platform’s improving efficiency as we scale. Our Hong Kong dual primary listing, supported by reputable institutional investors globally, strengthens our balance sheet and establishes WeRide as an attractive public investment opportunity in autonomous driving.” Unaudited Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results Revenues Total revenue grew 144.3% YoY to RMB171.0 million (US$24.0 million) in 3Q2025, compared to RMB70.0 million in the same period of 2024. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue was RMB114.7 million (US$16.1 million) compared to RMB65.5 million in the same period of 2024. The increase of cost of revenue was mainly due to (i) an increase in cost of goods sold, aligned with the sales increase; and (ii) a slight increase in costs of services, affected by an increase in costs of intelligent data services, partially offset by a decrease in costs of ADAS research and development (R&D) services. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit was RMB56.3 million (US$7.9 million) compared to RMB4.6 million in the same period of 2024, and gross margin was 32.9% compared to 6.5% in the same period of 2024. There were certain ADAS R&D service projects in 3Q2024 that incurred higher-than-expected costs, along with inventory write-downs. As no such items occurred in 3Q2025, both gross profit and gross margin recorded a significant YoY increase. Furthermore, certain ADAS R&D service projects with better margin profile further contributed to the increase of overall gross margin in 3Q2025. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were RMB435.8 million (US$61.2 million) compared to RMB895.7 million in the same period of 2024. Net Loss Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per ADS2 Balance Sheet Other Corporate Developments Exchange Rate Information This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.1190 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of September 30, 2025. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company’s management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights. The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company’s management to assess the Company’s operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company’s operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited. The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company’s historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company’s data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Conference Call Information The Company’s management team will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Monday, November 24, 2025 (or at 9:00 PM Beijing Time on Monday, November 24, 2025). Details for the conference call are as follows: Event Title: WeRide Inc.

Title: Let the dancing begin, Pope Alexios (the Infallible), his poor comrades, the Left’s vaudeville, the shop windows and the media

Time Published: 2025-11-24T08:09:43Z
Full Content:
Hello, today we have a journalistic celebration because, whichever way you look at it, we realized from our leader Alexis’ book, which has just come out piping hot, that in the end God does exist and of course so does the Virgin Mary. Apart from the fact that even Tsipras invoked Him in difficult moments (in Mati), we also understood it ourselves from the way we survived after the SYRIZA five-year period. So what the wise people say — “Holy Mary, help” and “God protect us” — somehow… exists, hidden as a wish deep in time, and perhaps it even holds true. To be honest with you, I leafed through the book Ithaca and I’m conveying to you whatever I understood subjectively. Tsipras, it is certain, did not write this book to apologize for anything, or almost anything. If one considers that the pivotal point of his term was the referendum, the negotiation, and its outcome — yet another memorandum worth 80–100 billion euros — for this Tsipras does not seem to repent at all. On the contrary, he considers it the correct political move which benefited the country. Meaning that if you asked him today whether he would do it again, or whether he would “take” the alternative solution the Europeans were offering him from the spring of 2015, he would obviously answer in the affirmative. Nor did I read him admitting mistakes in other critical issues, except for Zoe and Varoufakis, with whom, however, he untangled things early, since the summer of 2015. The one he utterly humiliates, clearly intentionally, is poor Kasselakis, although he does not accept that he “foisted” him onto SYRIZA. And really, if you sit and write that Tyler was asking Betty how they would raise his children with Stefanos when they go to the Maximos Mansion… you understand! Novartis-families Generally speaking I didn’t see him admit to having made a mistake, not even in the historical Novartis frame-up. There he says that “we shouldn’t have taken politicians to their natural judge but to a Preliminary Committee,” as if the Justice system were more controlled compared to the parliamentary majority he fully controlled. Even in his… attempt to make a supposed self-critique about the constant attacks on Mitsotakis’ family, he gives a completely ridiculous explanation regarding his wife, Mareva. Mitsotakis, he says, swept us away into mistakes with his communication mechanisms, resulting in “a state of siege and under the sway of anger, we adopted a tactic of highlighting scandals that concerned not only Mitsotakis but also the business activity of his wife…”. The truth of course is that he cultivated an entire media system to attack families, journalists, political opponents, etc., from the first to the last day of his term. These things of course sometimes go wrong in life — not to say almost always — and today his opponents will be enjoying his misfortunes with popcorn. Small first conclusion Nevertheless the book is very interesting because it is living history, and it will be read whether it enrages you or makes you happy because you are on the Left and nostalgically remember how lovely things were with Dritsas, Tasia, Filis, Zoe in her… right mind, and the rest of the crazy gang who brought us one step before the drachma. The book will get enormous publicity, it will raise limitless dust and disputes on both sides. It will… inevitably also assist the deeply wounded relationship of Samaras with ND, and ultimately it will benefit — gift, once again — Mitsotakis. And lastly: newspapers and shop windows Naturally I will return more analytically after I study the leader’s book, but I want to close today’s commentary with something I read that touches me in the job I’ve done for 40 years. Tsipras recounts his famous meeting with Psycharis in a mutual friend’s house, shortly before taking power. The late Stavros, after starting off with the theory that they had to come to an understanding because DOL always belonged to the… Democratic Camp, told him that at that time (DOL) was facing major financial problems, obviously implying that the new SYRIZA regime could help them. Then Tsipras, according to his own narrative, countered that they (DOL) were politically attacking them, etc. And Psycharis replied with the line: “Look, Alexis… newspapers are like shop-window displays. One time they have summer clothes, one time winter clothes. The shop is the same. The display changes.” What Psycharis told him — in truth, in a very digestible and vivid way — was, is, and I think will be the norm between power and the media, regardless of whether the (transaction) did not flourish at the time. With exceptions, of course, that stand out… Cabinet meeting The Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday was moved to Wednesday afternoon, as the funeral of Nikos Hardalias’ father intervenes. It has several items, from Justice issues regarding inheritances and Environmental provisions concerning spatial planning, and generally K.M. will give the final guidelines to the ministers for the year’s end. A party with a pulse There may not have been many local derbies in ND’s Prefectural and Local Organizations, but Piraeus headquarters mobilized strongly yesterday and counted its members ahead of the elections. The mechanism warmed up a bit; 122,000 people entered the process to pay and register, and indeed at a time when internal party matters are not at their peak. What they retain in ND is that the mechanism showed vital signs ahead of the congress to be held after Easter and of course ahead of the elections. Not to mention that the numbers for ND’s Prefectural elections are larger than the internal elections for the Presidency in other parties. Geopolitical stress tests are coming to the banks The SSM is attempting a closer approach regarding geopolitical risks for European banks. And because measurements in this case cannot be precise, it is virtually impossible for corresponding forecasts to be made. They would cost billions anyway. But although the approach seems somewhat lighter, in the end it becomes an additional headache for the banks. As far as our country is concerned, even without being in a red-hot zone, it constitutes a geopolitical area of increased priority for supervisors. Thus supervision is insistently asking Greek banks as well to “stress” similar data in the exercises they conduct, such as ICAAP for example, which is the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. This is an internal procedure banks apply to assess how resilient they are to adverse scenarios and how effective their risk-management processes are. To prove the point, JP Morgan’s Managing Director Kian Abouhossein raised the issue on Friday at the firm’s London road show, “interrogating” Pedro Machado, member of the ECB Supervisory Board. And he, among other things, answered that the thematic stress test for banks in 2026 will be an “inverse” exercise evaluating geopolitical-risk scenarios separately for each bank and their potential impact on each bank’s solvency. After all, this is the first priority of the SSM for the period 2026-2028: how banks will continue to strengthen their financial resilience in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Overall, discussions with banks, as he said, regarding the management of geopolitical risks continue and include the whole range: identifying these risks and of course taking the necessary actions to make banks more resilient to precisely these conditions. Signatures within the week for Ethniki Insurance The transaction for Ethniki Insurance is expected to be completed within the week. This means that the final signatures will be placed so that Piraeus Bank acquires 100% of the insurance company. And since the “what comes next” is always interesting, developments in the insurance scene around the country’s leading insurance company are expected. It is considered almost certain that sooner or later Ethniki Insurance will cooperate exclusively with its new shareholder. The above developments themselves set in motion the corresponding moves by National Bank to find a new insurance partner. Signing the agreement this week sets a milestone in that direction. The evolution at the level of bancassurance for all parties involved will become known in 2026. The ECB asks for more capital buffers from Revolut The SSM released the results of the stress test on Pillar 2 capital buffer requirements for all major European banks, and the Greek ones have among the lowest requirements, below 3%. National Bank at 2.50%, Eurobank at 2.75%, Piraeus and Alpha at 2.90%. The requirements relate to how banks operate, how they comply with SSM rules and controls. The logic is that those who do not comply are more vulnerable and therefore more capital requirements are imposed on them. There were also banks that saw an increase in their Pillar 2 required capital, such as Revolut, which became a systemic bank last year, but for next year its Pillar 2 capital requirement increased by 80 basis points to 4.50%, the highest among the 105 banks. Turnover party today at the Stock Exchange It is not unlikely that the value of transactions in today’s stock-market session will reach even 1 billion euros, due to the MSCI index rebalancing. We will have an explosive increase in turnover in the Metlen Energy & Metals stock, which is leaving the MSCI Greece Standard to join MSCI Europe, and in addition we have the entry of Viohalco and Cenergy Holdings into the Small Cap. The game professionals have played lately was classic: pressure on the stocks that are leaving MSCI until the rebalancing is completed, and an upward push on the stocks entering the MSCI indices so they are bought at high prices on rebalancing day. All this in a market that is yielding three times more than any other European market (General Index +40.28%, Banking Index +79.67%, FTSE 25 +46.08%) and with heavyweight stocks (e.g. Alpha Bank +123%, Piraeus +82%, National Bank +70%) that are flooding foreign investors’ portfolios with profits as they close out for 2025, right after Black Friday. AKTOR Group ready for a retail bond The AKTOR Group is preparing to issue a series of bonds worth 200 million euros, with a five-year duration, in order to borrow from savers at an interest rate close to 4%. At the beginning of the year, AKTOR had completed a 200-million-euro share capital increase, which was oversubscribed, to finance investments amounting to 2 billion euros. AKTOR is closely observing the success of retail bonds in the Greek market, especially after Greece’s upgrade to investment grade. The 4% for a five-year horizon for a group with a backlog that will reach 6 billion in 2025 sounds attractive. Over the past month, AKTOR Group’s stock has gained more than 11%, and its market capitalization is moving towards the target of 2 billion euros (today €1.89 billion). The difficult equation of the capital increase at ADMIE Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ recent reference from Singapore to the possibility of a capital increase at ADMIE confirms the activity surrounding the capital reinforcement of the operator. The aim is to ensure funding for the large ten-year development program worth 6 billion euros without losing state control, with the state retaining its statutory minority, meaning it must remain at 34%. The government team is fully aware that the ambitious grid interconnection program of the coming years—almost 6 billion euros—cannot move forward solely with own funds and European resources. The entry of new investors is now considered the only way, provided that public control is not undermined. In the background, American pressure appears to play a decisive role in the shareholding developments. Diplomatic sources report that Washington and Athens have repeatedly discussed reducing Chinese influence over energy infrastructure. And it is no coincidence that among the contenders for ADMIE (besides Italian TERNA, which had been mentioned in the past), BlackRock has recently appeared, with market observers speaking of “multi-layered American activity.” Opposite these dynamics stands the Chinese giant State Grid, which with its 24% stake and enhanced rights acquired in 2017 remains a key factor. Sources familiar with the discussions claim that the Chinese do not desire conflict but request a “clear picture” of what the new shareholding structure will entail. The high quorum required for the capital increase essentially makes their consent necessary. According to information, the Maximos Mansion seeks to complete the process within the new year so that the investment momentum is not lost and uncertainty in the markets is not prolonged. The question is whether a formula can be achieved that keeps the State above 34%, brings in the American capital sought by the allies, and leaves China without reason to react. The backstage chatter says that a solution exists but requires delicate handling. The Sarantis era in Ioannina The new era of Hellenic Dairies at Dodoni formally begins. After the approval of the deal by the Competition Commission, the acquisition was completed, and already since last Friday the company’s board was radically reshaped. Thus, Chairman of the Ioannina dairy industry becomes Stelios Sarantis, son of Michalis; CEO is Giorgos Sarantis, son of Takis; Vice-Chairman and head of market supervision matters is Mr. Athanasoulas Georgios; and Deputy CEO is Mr. Konstantinos Chytas. Mr. Vlachos Nikolaos also participates in the board as a member. According to the Sarantis brothers, Dodoni’s integration into the Hellenic Dairies group will be accompanied by a series of investments. We shall see… “Byzantino” returns to The Ilisian A new gastronomic arrival—marking the first “opening” of the new destination to the general public—is in its final stage, namely the Japanese restaurant at “The Ilisian,” at the former Hilton Athens which closed in January 2022. The new restaurant, expected to become the city’s new gastronomic hotspot ahead of Christmas, has its entrance on Michalakopoulou Street, is housed in the new extension built onto the iconic property, and will overlook the impressive indoor pool of the new destination. At “The Ilisian,” the private members-only House of NYNN club has been operating since the summer, but now the destination is gradually opening to everyone—Athenians and visitors—as part of the major investment being carried out in the former Hilton building by the Konstantakopoulos–Olayan duo. The Japanese restaurant, with its impressive marble entrance on Michalakopoulou, is the first of the nine dining venues that “The Ilisian” will host, expected to open before the new year. From 2026 onward, the remaining venues will gradually follow: The emblematic Galaxy Bar on the top floor will be reintroduced as “The Galaxy Dispensary,” with a large collection of wines and premium spirits, and next to it “The Galaxy Supper Club,” a luxurious space that will elevate haute cuisine in Athens. Similarly, the “Byzantino” restaurant—a constant value from the past—will return in 2026 with a renewed appearance, while a Lounge Café Bar will operate from early morning until late at night in the hotel lobby. Optimism for 2026 early bookings Based on early bookings for the 2026 season, Greek tourism appears to be moving positively, although—according to many in the sector last weekend at Xenia—it is currently running on “autopilot.” Nearly 85% of hotels, which are small and medium-sized businesses, “cannot secure financing, and access to capital is the exception,” said Giannis Chatzis, president of the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation, during the 13th general assembly of the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels last Saturday. Tourism stakeholders are awaiting on Wednesday the Ministry of Tourism’s event for the sector, attended also by the Prime Minister, and whether Kyriakos Mitsotakis will make announcements. Note that according to data from the Bank of Greece announced last Friday regarding the travel balance, even though September “slowed down” compared to last year—with 3.42 billion euros in revenue this year versus 3.55 billion last year during the same month—the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion euros for the first time, specifically reaching 20.13 billion euros, up 9% compared to the 18.47 billion in the January–September 2024 period. Wall Street is tightening for shipping companies The latest developments on Wall Street for shipping companies show that the game is changing—and in a way that resembles a silent shift rather than a dramatic maneuver. At the annual Marine Money Ship Finance Forum, the message was clear: the market for listed shipping companies in the U.S. has shrunk by nearly half over a decade, the result of a dual “cut” from mergers and privatizations. And even if the framework seems strictly technocratic, the essence is simple: companies that remain public have two choices—either grow or leave the exchange. The pressure stems not only from low valuations or compliance costs, but also from the fact that institutional investors are looking elsewhere. With less appetite for smaller shipping firms, well-established family-owned groups often choose to depart and return to the safety of private equity. Yet, even as the American market “tightens,” Greek shipping continues to maintain a notable presence with 31 listed companies. This is not only a matter of numbers but of stability in a market that is becoming increasingly selective. Greek shipowners, through smaller listings or larger structures, maintain their footprint, consistently seizing opportunities in public markets. At the same time, the major players who remain listed—especially in the tanker sector—now function as the “flagships” of Wall Street: large market caps, high liquidity, and greater support from the investment community. It is an environment where scale becomes a strategic advantage and where, in the future, we may see only a few strong players per sector. Aramco, the Americans, and Greece in the background Aramco’s recent moves in the U.S. are not simply business announcements; they indicate that the energy game around LNG is entering a new phase, with implications stretching from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. Aramco, traditionally oil-focused, has begun systematically expanding its presence in natural gas, signing agreements with American producers such as MidOcean (Lake Charles LNG) and Commonwealth LNG in Louisiana. These are projects totaling more than 25 mtpa, a scale capable of influencing future power dynamics in the global LNG market. Saudi Arabia is attempting to diversify its energy identity at a time when Europe and Asia seek stable LNG suppliers following the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. With more than 200 mtpa of new projects entering the market by 2030, whoever locks in strategic positions now will determine the future rules of the game. Moreover, strengthening U.S. production through foreign investment boosts America’s role as an energy superpower. This carries political weight in the Middle East, where Washington wants to maintain influence, and in the Eastern Mediterranean, where energy developments (Cyprus, Israel, Egypt) are at a critical point. And it opens a cycle of competition and opportunity for countries like Greece, which sees LNG taking a central role in its infrastructure—from Alexandroupoli to Revithoussa—making it a hub for flows toward the Balkans. Aristides and the… Pittas Fund While the major players in containerships worry about the orderbook-mountain coming toward 2027, Aristides Pittas seems to be following a different strategy — one Wall Street describes with a single phrase: “locking in the upside before the music stops.” In the last quarter, the head of the U.S.-listed Euroseas did something reminiscent of a hedge fund manager in “protect the portfolio from any possible storm” mode. Four newbuild vessels that haven’t even hit the water yet secured four-year charters at $35,500 per day, and a fifth one, already at sea, locked in close to $33,500. Some in New York would call it “building my yield before the correction begins.” He believes the big wave of new capacity will pressure the mega-ships, but not the feeder containerships. In other words, he is positioning himself in a segment that is shrinking — therefore becoming increasingly scarce and, consequently, more profitable for those who already have exposure there. At the brokers’ tables, people comment that Pittas “closed his 2026 books before they even opened.” With already 70% coverage of the 2026 operating days, the model looks more like a tech company locking in recurring revenue than a classic shipping company playing spot-to-spot. The best quarter for HELEX and Bouzna’s plans This afternoon, after the close of the session, HELEX will announce its Q3 results. Information converges toward the estimate that net profit for the third quarter will easily exceed €8 million — making this HELEX’s best quarter in the past 12 years. The HELEX share, at €5.96, trades at a discount of about -8% relative to its now-parent company, Euronext. For his part, Stéphane Bouzna has been giving interviews to international media in recent days, explaining Euronext’s broader plan. Of particular interest was his interview with CNBC, where — after praising the reform momentum of the Greek economy and reiterating plans to create a new technology and support hub in Athens now that the Athens Stock Exchange will migrate to Euronext’s advanced Optiq trading platform — he spoke about the broader strategy. Euronext is ready to contribute to the next level of market integration in Europe, creating a deeper liquidity pool for financing European entrepreneurship. He spoke about his contacts with the London Stock Exchange but did not hide that he also held discussions with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, explaining that it would be interesting for Deutsche Börse if it were willing to sell — in response to Chancellor Merz’s call for the creation of a pan-European stock exchange. The Trojan horse of… socialism in… golden California In California, 200 billionaires have been counted, with combined wealth estimated at $2 trillion.California’s budget is on the edge of a cliff, especially after President Trump’s federal government decision to cut healthcare spending by at least $30 billion. Suddenly, someone threw out the idea: Let’s impose an extraordinary one-off 5% levy on the wealth of California’s 200 billionaires so we can all live better. The Medicaid cuts threaten 145,000 jobs in the healthcare sector. The truth is that today, 1% of California taxpayers pay over 40% of the state’s income taxes. If yet another — “extraordinary, but who can be sure?” — 5% tax is imposed, how will the 200 billionaires react? Some will choose relocation to “friendlier” states such as Florida, Texas, or Nevada. Others will transfer ownership rights to trusts or offshore structures. Some will suspend planned investments in California, and others will reduce philanthropic and institutional funding. Triggered by the victory of the “socialist” Mamdani in New York, the debate is hot on California’s TV networks. The proposal faces constitutional obstacles, while previous similar initiatives were abandoned. California governor Gavin Newsom strongly opposes it. The healthcare workers’ union ignores him and pushes the vote forward. Ray Dalio no longer believes in bitcoin Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, gave an interview to CNBC and revealed that he now holds only 1% of his portfolio in bitcoin. It is a position that resembles more a safety valve than an investment conviction. Dalio argued that bitcoin will never become a reserve currency for major countries because, after spectacular developments in quantum computing, the cryptocurrency can be detected, controlled, and — most importantly — compromised. That’s why Dalio again believes in gold. The truth is that in the past Dalio said quite the opposite about bitcoin (“it has proven its value… it hasn’t been hacked… it has stood the test of time”). But now that bitcoin’s exchange rate is collapsing, and after Google’s presentation of its quantum supercomputer, Dalio’s stance has changed dramatically… Yesterday, the bitcoin price had plunged to as low as $84,600 before recovering later above $86,700.

Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle is retiring soon, but you can get this $65 Lego Mario set for $28 in Amazon's Black Friday sale. By Steven Petite on November 23, 2025 at 5:55PM PST Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon Update: This deal is no longer available. For the second week in a row, Amazon is selling a Lego Super Mario playset for over 50% off during its Black Friday sale. Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set. Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT. Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50). The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: AI Data Center Overinvestment Debate Intensifies
URL: https://newsonjapan.com/article/147701.php
Time Published: 2025-11-23T20:35:47Z
Full Content:
TOKYO, Nov 24 (News On Japan) - A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure. Amazon followed with multi-trillion-yen bond issuance of its own, accelerating investor unease that Big Tech may be committing to expansion on a scale that will be difficult to recover through future earnings. Analysts note that similar alarms were raised in the spring, when Microsoft’s rapid increase in data-center investment briefly pushed its share price downward. Although Microsoft later demonstrated stronger-than-expected cloud profitability, restoring the stock’s momentum, recent market reactions suggest that investors are once again sensitive to the possibility of overcapacity. At the center of the market’s short-term anxiety is Nvidia, whose earnings announcement was scheduled for release on the evening of November 6th U.S. time. Although Nvidia is the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization and its quarterly results draw global attention, industry specialists argue that Nvidia itself is not responsible for the potential overinvestment problem. Because the company does not build data centers—supplying only the semiconductors used within them—its exposure to investment risk remains limited. The current concerns, they say, relate primarily to the companies constructing the facilities, not the device manufacturers responding to orders. Capital-expenditure forecasts compiled by market analysts illustrate the divide: Apple and Nvidia appear at the bottom in terms of anticipated outlays, while Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle show steep upward investment trajectories. Apple, in particular, has deliberately avoided the data-center arms race, choosing instead to rely on hybrid models using external AI infrastructure rather than directly competing in facility construction. Oracle, buoyed by demand from OpenAI, has recently accelerated its investment pace. Meta’s stock has come under especially heavy selling pressure, with the company falling nearly 10 percent following its bond-issuance announcement. Market participants attribute this reaction to two factors: first, CEO Zuckerberg’s remark that it remains uncertain whether the investment will translate directly into profit growth, but that “not investing now would be the greater risk.” Analysts viewed the statement as an inversion of normal capital-expenditure logic, prompting concerns about strategic discipline. Second, investors remain wary after Meta’s earlier push into the metaverse failed to gain traction despite major financial commitments and a corporate name change. Even so, some specialists argue that technologies dismissed as premature—such as AI a decade ago—can surge once the right market environment arrives. The long history of metaverse-like platforms, including the rise and collapse of virtual worlds such as Second Life in the mid-2000s, is often cited as evidence that cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation repeat until demand eventually aligns. For now, however, the data-center overinvestment question dominates market sentiment. Investors are watching whether the massive spending undertaken by major U.S. platforms can be justified by future profits—or whether companies like Apple, which has largely stayed out of the infrastructure race, will ultimately be rewarded for their restraint. The outcome, analysts say, will shape the competitive landscape over the next one to two years and could significantly influence the direction of global AI development.

Source: テレ東BIZ A powerful earthquake struck the Aso region of Kumamoto at around 6:01 p.m. on November 25th, toppling a residential gate in Aso City and scattering roof tiles across the road, while rockfalls and damage were reported in nearby areas. A Ferris wheel at the Expocity commercial complex in Suita, Osaka, known as the tallest in Japan at 123 meters, came to an abrupt stop on November 25th after a lightning strike disabled its operating system, leaving 20 passengers trapped in nine gondolas until the early hours of the following morning. A large-scale water outage continued across parts of Okinawa on November 25th after a damaged pipeline caused significant leakage the previous day, with local authorities reporting ongoing disruptions as of 11:35 a.m. Yellow dust is forecast to reach Fukuoka from the morning of November 25th through November 26th, prompting the city to urge residents—particularly those with respiratory or allergy-related conditions—to take precautions such as wearing masks when going outdoors. A large fire that broke out late on November 23rd at a waste plastic recycling plant in the city of Bando in Ibaraki has continued to burn for roughly 18 hours, with no clear timeline for containment. The blaze was first reported at around 10:40 p.m. on November 23rd when nearby residents alerted firefighters after seeing flames and smoke rising from the site. Nvidia maintains an estimated 80% share of the global AI chip market, but a surge of new competitors is beginning to challenge the company’s dominance, reshaping expectations across the semiconductor industry. Japan is often perceived internationally as adopting Al cautiously rather than rapidly. Yet 2025 is starting to show a different reality. Japan's digital currency sector has transformed from a Wild West frontier into one of the most carefully monitored markets in the world. A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. A dramatic shift is beginning to unfold in software development as AI transforms programming into an everyday skill that no longer requires specialist expertise, a trend highlighted in a forthcoming set of 2026 technology forecasts compiled by Nikkei BP. Generative AI continues to evolve at astonishing speed, raising both expectations and concerns about a future in which machine intelligence surpasses human capability, and according to Shota Imai, a 31-year-old visiting professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology who is emerging as one of the country’s leading young AI researchers, the question now is how closely AI’s value systems can be aligned with those of humans, as breakthroughs since the arrival of ChatGPT push society into uncharted territory. ここ数年、日本企業では多くの大きな変化が起きています。その中でも特に注目されているのが AI OCR の活用です。 Apple’s position in the global race for artificial intelligence is increasingly in focus as questions continue to surface over whether the company has fallen behind Google and Microsoft, and how it compares with Nvidia, now one of the world’s most powerful semiconductor makers. © 2025 News On Japan.

It’s been a rough stretch for many budgets, thanks to tariffs and rising grocery bills. If you stashed money this year in a Flexible Spending Account (aka a Flexible Spending Arrangement) and managed to dodge major medical expenses, now’s the time to put those hard-earned, pre-tax dollars to work for you and stock up for 2026 before your plan’s deadline. While FSAs are best known for covering copays and over-the-counter basics—like anti-inflammatories and cold & flu meds, first-aid and emergency kits, and vision and eye-care—you may also be able to put that balance toward high-tech health wearables, mobility and recovery gear, or even certain specialty mattresses and e-bike setups with a doctor’s note. And there’s no legal reason you can’t take advantage of that FSA and a discount shopping holiday like Black Friday/Cyber Monday simultaneously, so scroll those sales ASAP! You’ve already used the funds to lower this year’s tax liability; now let them enhance next year’s life. A health FSA is an employer-sponsored benefit that lets you set aside part of each paycheck—up to $3,300 for 2025—into an account for out-of-pocket medical costs. You decide whether to opt in when you start a job or during annual open enrollment or other qualifying life events, and then determine how much to contribute from each paycheck. Think of it as a single-year health nest egg you can use for deductibles, copayments, prescriptions, and a range of eligible medical expenses. Traditionally, you submit a claim to your FSA administrator with proof of what you bought and confirmation that insurance didn’t cover it. Many plans now offer a debit card you can swipe like a checking account, but it’s still smart to save your receipts in case your plan—or the IRS—asks for documentation later. An FSA can be a powerful budgeting tool for people with predictable, recurring medical costs, such as a payment plan for braces, monthly insulin refills, or a new annual supply of contact lenses. But if your FSA is more of a “just in case” cushion, it’s easy to reach the end of the year with a surprising amount of money sitting there—and a countdown to spend it. Unlike Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), FSAs require you to spend your balance by December 31 or you forfeit the funds. Some employers offer a small rollover—up to $660—or a grace period of an extra month or two to use the remaining funds. For your plan’s exact rules, check with your employer. What’s covered by FSA reimbursement is determined by the IRS and must be a “qualified medical expense.” In the IRS docs, that’s defined as “costs related to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or expenses that affect the structure or function of the body.” First-aid supplies and over-the-counter meds may come to mind first, but it can also include things like: Your FSA provider is ultimately the referee here. If you’re hoping to get reimbursed for something that isn’t clearly listed as an eligible expense, you may need a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)—essentially a note from your doctor explaining why you need it for a specific condition. With an LMN, some plans will cover things like vitamins, exercise equipment or fitness trackers, specialty pillows or mattresses, and even massage guns, as long as they’re prescribed to treat a documented medical issue and your plan signs off. It’s easy to find FSA-eligible items online; many vendors clearly label FSA and HSA items, and large retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and CVS have dedicated portals. Supergoop! This staff favorite is one of the few sunscreens that some of us will put on our faces. It goes on invisible—no smeary white to rub in—and is virtually weightless. How does a liquid leave a powdery feel? We’re not sure about the chemistry, but we know it happens. And if you’re outdoorsy, it’s not just important during sunny summer, so it’s a perfect Add to Cart. Banana Boat Need a bigger bottle to smear on the kids? This family size provides SPF 50 protection that resists sweat and water. But remember: You’re supposed to put a shot glass’s worth of sunscreen on each time you head out in the rays. OMRON Blood pressure probably isn’t top of mind unless you know yours is too high or too low. Having a reliable monitor at home provides a convenient way to check your blood pressure more often than random clinical visits, which can help spot sudden changes or changing trends. Versions with arm cuffs, like this Omron Platinum model, tend to be more accurate than the wrist-worn kind. This model stores up to 100 readings for two users and syncs with the OMRON connect app to easily share reports with your doctor. Dexcom Part of the promise of tech-infused health care is more personalized care. The cost of devices like at-home glucose monitors has come down enough that people can now see how different foods, workouts, and even sleep affect their blood sugar in real time. This particular device was created for people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin, those with prediabetes, and health-conscious adults. Johnson & Johnson This compact first-aid kit is small and inexpensive enough to stash anywhere you tend to do everyday damage and suddenly need a bandage. Inside are 80 pieces of essential care—hand-cleaning wipes, extra-strength Tylenol, gauze, Neosporin, and more—all in a package that fits easily in a glove box, desk drawer, or carry-on bag. FriCARE We stash these self-adhesive rolls of tape in all sorts of places: first-aid kits, sports bags, most notably. They’re latex-free, great for sprains or just holding gauze or large bandages in place without using the kind of tape that feels like it’s going to rip your skin off when you remove it. It’s even useful for furry family members (animal or human). Biotrue Contact solutions do expire, but regular users often find they fly through these 10-ounce bottles faster than they expect. This two-pack of multipurpose cleaner also comes with a new contact case to replace your crusty one. ThinOptics We know two things about readers: either you refuse to wear them, or you own a pair that’s never where you actually need it. ThinOptics solves that with ultra-slim specs that tuck into a case and attach to the back of your phone. They’re armless, resting on your nose like an old-timey pince-nez, and come in standard 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 magnifications. iHealth Is the coughing and sneezing some dust or something bigger? Stock up on these rapid 15-minute tests to get your first indications whether you have flu or COVID, and then plan out your next steps. Clearblue Preggers? Not preggers? Whichever outcome you want, this early-detection test finds even low concentrations of the pregnancy hormone and features a wide tip for, uh, easier collection. Some of the more surprising gadgets and big-ticket buys aren’t “swipe your FSA card and walk away” purchases; they usually require you to pay in full and do a little extra after checkout. But if you’re not afraid of some paperwork, some cool splurges can help you improve your health. For many, brands partner with a program like Truemed, which has you fill out a health survey after purchase so a licensed provider can review your situation and, if you qualify, issue a Letter of Medical Necessity. Then you simply submit the letter plus your receipt (sometimes only for the amount above a “basic” version), and your FSA administrator processes repayment. Here are just a few examples of tech you might have thought was cool, but could also be FSA reimbursable (confirm with your insurance/doctor before any major purchase). Ray-Ban Glasses are one of the most fun (or at least most functional) ways to burn through FSA funds—and if you wear prescription lenses, that can even include Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, aka AI glasses in disguise. They correct your vision and let you whisper questions to Meta AI (“What’s the currency conversion?” “Where’s the nearest coffee?”) while casually snapping photos and videos without doing the full phone-fumble. (This is a joy we’ve experienced first-hand on rocky ridges with the dog, where you need all your hands free but still want a picture of your furry friend against the horizon.) They’re also a great way to escape the tyranny of noise-canceling headphones: tiny speakers and mics aim sound at your ears so you can play music, get reminders, and still hear the real world happening around you. Plus, upcoming software updates will likely expand the capabilities, including their use as hearables (though there are already dedicated Nuance Audio hearing frames you can purchase as an FSA-eligible prescription pair if you’re more concerned with what’s audible than what’s AI). There are other Meta models that qualify. But no matter what frame shape you select, we also highly recommend getting Transitions lenses, so they pull seamless double duty as both your everyday specs with blue light filters and your stylish sunnies. One caveat: super-strong prescriptions (the kind that usually require high-index lenses) may not work in Meta Ray-Bans due to the delicate electronics, which could be damaged by the pressure required to insert the optics. Oura A discreet, screenless health tracker, the Oura Ring 4 goes far beyond sleep. It automatically tracks activity, blood oxygen, heart and respiratory rate, and skin temperature changes, then turns those metrics into clear, behavior-focused guidance in the app. You can even log personal factors—like caffeine intake or alcohol consumption—to see what’s affecting your rest. It’s ideal for people who care more about health insights than hardcore fitness training stats, and who want something smaller and subtler than a smartwatch. To unlock the full features of the ring, a membership is also required. Other wearables—Garmin smartwatches, for example—can qualify for reimbursement with a post-purchase Truemed assessment and approval. While select sleep and heart-rate monitors (and smart scales) don’t even require that. Ride1Up Exercise is a huge part of staying healthy—and yes, some e-bikes can qualify for FSA spending. We’re talking Class 1 e-bikes only: operable pedals, no throttle, and a max assist speed of 20 mph to make sure you get some sort of workout.At Ride1Up, for example, you can choose from the road-ready CF Racer1 (pictured above), the off-road TrailRush, or the commuter-friendly Prodigy v2. After checkout, Ride1Up will send you a quick Truemed health survey, and if you’re approved, you’ll get the Letter of Medical Necessity you need to submit your purchase for FSA reimbursement. If there’s another ebike brand you’ve been eyeing, it’s worth checking their site. Purple Much like e-bikes, mattresses usually require a Letter of Medical Necessity, and not every model qualifies. You need features that go beyond a basic bed—pressure relief, targeted support, cooling layers, or designs that help with pain or sleep issues—which means going beyond a basic bed’s price. For example, Purple’s RestorePlus Hybrid (pictured above) fits the bill with three inches of GelFlex Grid that contours to your body, supports your lower back, and sleeps cooler than traditional materials. Funds will come in handy when purchasing a multithousand-dollar mattress, but as owners of a Purple RejuvenatePremier (as well as a lumbar back cushion for long-haul flights), we can vouch for the namesake material’s relief return on investment. Keep in mind that often only part of the mattress is eligible for reimbursement—usually the amount that exceeds the price of a basic mattress. After purchase, Purple partners with Truemed, which sends a quick medical survey plus simple instructions for submitting that eligible portion to your HSA/FSA administrator. Other mattress manufacturers may have similar setups. Chirp Chronic pain sufferers might be interested in the Halo, a $199.99 device that combines TENS and EMS technologies to deliver electrical pulses that both block pain signals and increase blood flow to sore areas. The charging case holds two Halo pucks, a rechargeable remote, extension cables, and a set of reusable magnetic pads. Not sure where to place the pads? The companion app shows you exactly where to apply them based on your pain points. You can choose from six preset programs and still adjust the intensity and duration to your comfort level. Purchases through the Chirp website can be made with FSA/HSA cards, though the company notes you may need additional documentation for reimbursement. Theragun There are massage guns and then there are Theraguns. The $649.99 PRO Plus doesn’t just hammer whatever hurts; the app gives you smart, guided routines so you’re treating the right muscles (often the ones around the sore spot). When you connect a Garmin, Apple Watch, Strava, or Google Fit, it pulls in your activity to build personalized recovery plans based on your goals, actual workouts, and current science. Hardware-wise, it’s fully loaded: hot attachments for soothing warmth, built-in LED light therapy (a miniaturized panel like those skin tone/texture therapy Glo masks, which are also FSA eligible), plus all the classic heads—standard ball, dampener, thumb, wedge, and micro-point. If you want to go full hot-and-cold recovery geek, you can even add a separate cold attachment. It’s basically a high-end recovery studio.

Title: Analyst who called the dot-com bubble says Americans are turning a deaf ear to AI warnings—and a worse meltdown than 2008 looms
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/23/is-ai-bubble-albert-edwards-worse-than-2008/
Time Published: 2025-11-23T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Albert Edwards, the outspoken global strategist at Société Générale—a figure who even refers to himself as a “perma bear”—is certain that the current U.S. equity market, driven largely by high-flying tech and AI, is experiencing a dangerous bubble. (Société Générale, to be clear, does not hold the view that U.S. stocks or AI stocks are in a bubble, noting that Edwards is employed as the in-house alternative view.) While history often repeats itself, Edwards warned recently that the circumstances surrounding this cycle’s inevitable collapse are fundamentally different, potentially leading to a deeper and more painful reckoning for the economy and the average investor. “I think there’s a bubble but there again I always think there’s a bubble,” Edwards told Bloomberg’s Merryn Somerset Webb in a recent appearance on her podcast Merryn Talks Money, noting that during each cycle there is always a “very plausible narrative, very compelling.” However, he was unwavering in his conclusion: “It will end in tears, that much I’m sure of.” Edwards told Fortune in an interview that previous theories about a bubble were “very convincing in 1999 and early 2000; they were very convincing in 2006–2007.” Each time, he said, the “surge in the market was so relentless” that he just stopped talking about bubbles, “because clients get pissed off with you repeating the same thing over and over again and being wrong,” only to change their tune after the bubble bursts. “Generally, when you’re gripped by a bubble, people just don’t want to listen because they’re making so much money.” As he himself frequently points out, Edwards is known as a very bearish market strategist who has made some high-profile and dramatic predictions, often warning about major stock market crashes and recessions. His track record includes famously calling the dotcom bubble, but it also includes warnings that haven’t panned out, such as predicting a potential 75% drop in the S&P 500 from peaks—worse than the 2008 Financial Crisis lows. When the New York Times profiled Edwards in 2010, it noted that the chuckling, Birkenstocks-wearing analyst had been predicting a Japan-style stagnation for U.S. equity markets since 1997 (a prediction he repeated in his interview with Fortune). Still, Edwards insists that the current parallels to the late 1990s Nasdaq bubble are clear: extremely rich valuations in tech, with some U.S. companies trading at over 30x forward earnings, justified by compelling growth narratives. Just as the TMT (technology, media, telecom) sector attracted vast, sometimes wasted capital investment in the 1990s, Edwards argued that today’s enthusiasm echoes that earlier era. There are two key differences that could lead to a much worse outcome this time, though. In previous cycles, Edwards explained, the catalyst for a bubble’s demise was usually the monetary authority’s tightening cycle—the Federal Reserve hiking rates and exposing market froth. This time, with the Fed lowering rates, that trigger is conspicuously absent. Bank of America Research has noted the rarity of central banks cutting rates amid rising inflation, which has occurred just 16% of the time since 1973. Ominously, BofA released a note on the “Ghosts of 2007” in August. Instead of tightening, Edwards anticipates the Fed will move away from quantitative tightening and likely shift to quantitative easing “quite soon” because of issues in the U.S. repo markets, another ghost from the Great Recession. The Fed itself issued a staff report in 2021 on repo issues, writing in 2021 that trading between 2007 and 2009 “highlighted important vulnerabilities of the U.S. repo market.” Repo issues reemerged in the pandemic, with the Richmond Fed noting that interest rates “spiked dramatically higher” starting in 2019. Edwards told Bloomberg that the absence of hawkish policy could lead to a “further melt-up,” making the eventual burst even more damaging. Poking fun at himself, Edwards said, “I just got bored being bearish, basically rattling my chains saying, ‘This is all a bubble; it’s all going to collapse.’” He said that he can see how the bubble can actually keep going for much longer than a perma bear like himself would find logical, “and actually that’s when something just comes out the woodwork and takes the legs from out from under the bubble.” “What’s more worrying about the AI bubble,” Edwards told Fortune, “is how much more dependent the economy is on this theme, not just for the business investments, which is driving growth,” but also the fact that consumption growth is being dominated far more than normal by the top quintile. In other words, the richest Americans who are heavily invested in equities are driving more of the economy than during previous bubbles, accounting for a much larger proportion of consumption. “So the economy, if you like, is more vulnerable than it was in the ’87 crash,” Edwards explained, with a 25% or greater correction in stocks meaning that consumer spending will surely suffer—let alone a 50% lurch. Edwards told Bloomberg he was concerned about the widespread participation of retail investors who have been dragged into the market, encouraged to “just buy the dips.” This belief that “the stock market never goes down” is dangerous, Edwards warned, arguing that a 30% or even a 50% decline is very possible. The inequality of American society and the heavy concentration among high earners whose wealth has been “inflated by the stock market” is a major concern for Edwards, who pointed out that if there is a major stock market correction, then U.S. consumption will be “hit very, very badly indeed,” and the entire economy will suffer. This view is increasingly shared by less über-bearish voices on Wall Street, such as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett. In many ways, Edwards told Fortune, we’re overdue for a correction, noting that apart from two months during the pandemic, there hasn’t been a recession since 2008. “That’s a bloody long time, and the business cycle eventually always goes into recession.” He said it’s been so long that his perma-bear instincts are confused. “The fact I’m less worried about an imminent collapse [right now] makes me worried,” Edwards added with a laugh. Edwards told Fortune that he’s been through various cycles and bubbles and he gained his perma-bear status in the mid-1990s, when he felt a distant earthquake happening in Asia. “You’ve been around the block a few times, you just do become cynical,” he said, before correcting himself: “That’s not the right word. You become extremely skeptical of the full narrative.” He proudly repeats the story about how, when he was at Dresdner Kleinwort in the ’90s, he wrote with skepticism about Malaysia’s economic boom at the time, only to be surprised when Thailand blew up first. Nevertheless, he said, “we lost all our banking licenses [in Malaysia] because of what I wrote,” adding that the story is still proudly pinned to his X.com account. “I had to sort of basically hide under my desk,” Edwards said of the inward reception to the emergence of his inner bear. “Corporate finance banking departments certainly didn’t appreciate losing all their banking licenses. But in retrospect, you know, they avoided a final year of lending to Malaysia before it blew up. They didn’t thank me afterwards.” Beyond equity valuations, Edwards has been highlighting two other major underlying risks that point to systemic vulnerability. First, Edwards emphasized the long-term risk of inflation in the West, driven by “fiscal incontinence.” Despite short-term cyclical deflationary pressure emanating from China—which has seen 12 successive quarters of year-on-year declines in its GDP deflator—Edwards said he believes the path of least resistance for highly indebted Western politicians will be “money printing.” At some point, the mathematics for fiscal sustainability “just do not add up,” forcing central banks to intervene through “yield curve control” or quantitative easing to hold down bond yields. This is where Edwards’ long-held thesis about Japan comes in, what he calls “the Ice Age.” Around 1996, he said, he started thinking that “what’s happening in Japan will come to Europe and the U.S. with a lag.” He explained that the bursting of the Japanese stock bubble led to all kinds of nasty things: real interest rates collapsing, inflation going to zero, bond yields going to zero. Ultimately, it was a period of low growth that Japan still has not been able to break out of. The difference with the U.S., he added, is that Japanification actually started happening in 2000 with the dotcom bubble bursting, but “the relationship broke” between the economy and asset prices as the Fed began “throwing money” at the problem through QE. The U.S. has essentially been in a 25-year bubble since then that is due to burst any day now, he argued—it’s been due any day for a quarter-century. “We’re going to end up with runaway inflation at some point,” Edwards told Fortune, “because, I mean, that’s the end game, right? There’s no appetite to cut back the deficits. We bring back the QE, if and when this bubble bursts, the only solution is more QE, and then we end up with inflation, maybe even worse than 2022.” Edwards also sees a smoking gun in home prices. “You look at the U.S. housing market, you think, ‘Well, actually, is the Fed just too loose relative to everywhere else?’ Because why should other housing bubbles have deflated in terms of house price earnings ratio, but the U.S. is still stuck up there at maximum valuation or close to it?” In a flourish that shows why Edwards is so respected despite his broken-record reputation, he notes that in a Bloomberg Opinion piece from 2018, legendary former Fed Chair Paul Volcker “eviscerated the Fed just before he died.” The central banker who famously slew inflation in the 1980s argued that the modern era’s loose monetary policy was “a grave error of judgment…basically just kicking the can down the road.” Edwards shared an OECD chart with Fortune to show just how much U.S. housing has decoupled from global markets because the Fed has been too loose. The analyst also said he applied his skepticism to private equity, an asset class that he sees having benefited immensely from years of falling bond yields and leverage. Private equity’s advantage has been its tax treatment and the fact that “it doesn’t have to mark itself to market, so it isn’t very volatile.” However, the sector is highly leveraged, and if the global environment shifts to a secular bear market for bonds, he said that would be a “major problem.” Recent high-profile bankruptcies have started to leak into bond markets, prompting concern of “credit cockroaches,” as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently labeled the issue. Drawing on the metaphor that “you never have just one cockroach,” Edwards warned that these bankruptcies signal deeper issues in a highly leveraged sector that has spread its “tentacles…deeply into the real economy.” Fortune notes to Edwards that more mainstream, less bearish voices are sounding similar warnings, including Mohamed El-Erian at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference and Jeffrey Gundlach, the “bond king,” who takes a similarly skeptical view of private equity. Edwards agreed that something is in the air. “I would say there are more voices of skepticism. And again, this is one thing which makes me worry. This bubble can go on. If it is a bubble [it] can go on quite a long while. Well, we can kick the can down the road many times. Normally, the skeptics are swept aside.” For investors trapped between the fear of a collapse and the fear of missing a melt-up, Edwards advised investors to take him with a grain of salt but be mindful of potential warning signs. “I say that I predict a recession every year. Don’t listen to me, but these are the things you should be looking out for.” Paraphrasing an infamous quote from former Citi CEO Chuck Prince that summed up the bubble mentality with a metaphor about a dance party, Edwards recommended: “In terms of dancing while the music’s still playing, you have to decide whether to be in front of the band, pogoing, or dancing close to the fire escape, ready to get out first.”

Title: 'Entitled,' 'complacent,' and 'sloppy': Inside the workplace tension at the world's largest HR organization

On September 11, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator sang a sultry rendition of "Happy Birthday" to an executive at the Virginia headquarters of the Society for Human Resource Management. The brief performance, which took place in a conference room with about 75 employees, came after remarks honoring the 24th anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. Two former staffers who were present at the gathering, recordings of which were reviewed by Business Insider, said it was uncomfortable to see — and not just because it was sexually suggestive. They found it inappropriate because their former employer, also known as SHRM, is the world's largest HR trade group. SHRM has been embroiled in controversy in recent years. Some of these challenges have gripped workplaces across the country, including regular layoffs and restructurings and debates over DEI. Other elements, however, set SHRM apart. They include a new attendance policy that penalizes workers who arrive even a minute after 9 a.m.; a memo about a "conservative" dress code that referenced "enclothed cognition" and bans sequins; an employment discrimination lawsuit set to go to trial in December; and a company-wide meeting in which CEO Johnny C. Taylor Jr. said some staffers were "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The issues raise questions about SHRM's role as an arbiter of human resources best practices. Thousands of HR professionals rely on SHRM's educational materials and credentialing programs to get ahead in their careers. It shapes not only HR departments across the country, but also national policy, briefing judges and lawmakers on workforce practices. Now, some professionals are deciding not to renew their memberships, and former employees are speaking out about their experiences on social media. "If your business is about teaching others what to do in the people space, then it's incredibly important that you model that yourself," said Ashley Herd, a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey, co-host of the podcast "HR Besties," and founder of Manager Method, a management-training company. "No organization is expected to be perfect, but SHRM puts out articles and charges a lot of money to teach about best practices," added Herd. "When they don't follow those practices themselves, that really does speak volumes." SHRM said that Taylor, a lawyer and executive who was named CEO in late 2017, deserved credit for turning the organization around. "Change is not a sign of instability — it's a sign of leadership," spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in an email to Business Insider. In a statement, Taylor said he believes SHRM is fulfilling its mission of partnering "with HR professionals and the CEO community." "We're doing it better than ever," he told Business Insider. Revenue grew from $131 million in 2017 to $233 million last year, according to public tax filings. It has 413 employees today, up from 387 in December 2017. This article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former SHRM employees and nearly a dozen current and former members, as well as legal and tax filings and government records. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. SHRM was founded in 1948 and today describes itself as "the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces." Former staffers characterized it as a punitive workplace. Under a policy instituted earlier this year, those who arrived even one minute past 9 a.m. were told to go to security and have someone on the executive team escort them to their desks, former employees said. Two former staffers said that they saw a pregnant colleague cry because she fell and hurt herself running to the entrance to make it in on time. A memo sent to SHRM's brand and marketing staff in January laid out a dress code that included a lengthy introduction about "enclothed cognition," a term that refers to the notion that the clothing workers wear impacts their performance. The code required staff to dress in "conservative" business attire and prohibited items such as sneakers, denim, skorts, sequins, hats, and clothing that doesn't cover the area between the shoulders and knees. Burke said "SHRM offers employees the flexibility to arrive between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." and noted that the workplace is remote Mondays and Fridays. He said the trade group at large has a business-casual dress code, and said "enclothed cognition" was not a company policy. Nearly all former SHRM employees who spoke to Business Insider said there was confusion and fear of retaliation in the workplace. In an all-hands meeting last month, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider, Taylor called many of the organization's employees "entitled," "complacent," and "sloppy." The comments were part of a broader announcement about forthcoming layoffs. Taylor said that he hadn't yet consulted with anyone about his plans, according to the recording. "Literally, I've not told anyone, because I've been trying to figure out where I was going to land, and I've landed on a decision," Taylor said. "I am going to reorganize the business of SHRM. There will be a total reorg … And this is not a decision that I've made again with anyone, no one." His comments came several weeks after another call with a smaller group of staffers in which he said no layoffs were planned. Snippets of both meetings were compiled by Benjamin Schmidt, a former employee, and posted publicly to TikTok. SHRM cut staff earlier this month. In an internal video message viewed by Business Insider announcing the reductions, Taylor said SHRM treated people with dignity during layoffs, describing SHRM's approach as "red carpet in, red carpet out." In his statement, Taylor said November's "organizational redesign is about shifting for the future, not reacting to the past," adding that the cuts were not due to financial strain and that the organization has an "enviable balance sheet." Former employees said layoffs occurred annually in recent years. They said Taylor frequently reorganized the business, resulting in job cuts and reassignments for those who remained. In some cases, full teams were let go. "It was made very clear to all that if you were not 100% aligned with whatever the latest messaging was from SHRM leadership, you were encouraged to find another job," said one former staffer. In his statement, Taylor said, "Over the last several years, which were characterized by ultra-low unemployment rates and a war for talent, we hired individuals who were not aligned with SHRM's mission, values, or culture." "That's on us — and we've corrected it. We are transparent internally about what doesn't work here, and when it's not a fit, people should move on." Over the past several years, layoffs have become commonplace in industries like tech and media. Companies such as Google and Microsoft have regularly trimmed their ranks, and the trend doesn't show any signs of slowing down: During its latest round of cuts, Amazon said it expected to uncover "additional places we can remove layers" and "realize efficiency gains" in 2026. Repeated layoffs can be a sign of poor leadership, said Herd, the former head of HR for North America at McKinsey. SHRM is "literally describing themselves as experts in all things work and selling best practices in talent planning. To then turn around and do layoffs themselves, it stings for the workers who you thought were a fit for all these years. It rings hollow to put the blame ostensibly on the people you chose to hire." "Whether they like it or not, they are held to a higher standard because they've put themselves out there as the preeminent expert on work." "It shows there are gaps in their talent planning," she said. Some former employees said colleagues who openly questioned leadership's decisions or cited concerns about SHRM's workplace culture were gone soon after. Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the suggestion that employees were terminated for having differing views "does not reflect how SHRM operates." "This is not about silencing dissent — it is about ensuring that our teams remain aligned, effective, and able to execute with excellence," he said. Daniel Burchfield, who joined SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation in 2024, said performance issues were cited in his February termination. But he said he hadn't been reprimanded or put on a performance improvement plan. "Nothing negative was indicated to me," he said. Two weeks before his termination, Burchfield said he told his manager he was worried about layoffs. He said the manager replied that SHRM likes to maintain an atmosphere of fear to drive performance. Burchfield said he told his manager that logic was "unhealthy." SHRM itself has said as much. "It's important for leaders to recognize that fear at work can cause a host of ill effects that undermine the quality of people's output as well as overall team performance," reads a 2023 article on its website titled "How to Remove Fear from Your Work Culture." "SHRM is meant to be setting the standard for how to run a workplace," Alexandria Kinsey, a former employee who was fired in April, told Business Insider. "They do the opposite of what they preach." Kinsey was let go in part because she had become "disruptive," the organization said. She said her behavior was a response to SHRM's "broken and toxic system." In 2022, Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at SHRM as an instructional designer, filed a lawsuit against the organization in Colorado federal court. Mohamed, who was at SHRM from 2016 to 2020, said in her suit that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management. She said she raised concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation with leadership, including Taylor and SHRM's human-resources head, throughout the summer of 2020. Last year, a judge called the case "messy" and said the evidence showed that the same HR person tasked with investigating Mohamed's complaints was also ghostwriting emails for Mohamed's boss and drafting Mohamed's termination paperwork around the same time. SHRM's guide on "How to Conduct a Workplace Investigation," dated about two weeks after that decision, said investigators "should focus on being impartial to gather and consider relevant facts and should not push the investigation in any particular direction." SHRM has consistently denied Mohamed's claims. In his statement, Taylor said that "SHRM doesn't comment on pending cases, but we will say this: we do not settle meritless cases. We know the facts, and we trust the process." Lawyers for Mohamed didn't reply to calls or emails. The case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on December 1, is unusual, Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston, told Business Insider. Workplace-discrimination lawsuits rarely get this far, he said. Further, SHRM didn't bring an independent investigator to oversee its internal probe into the matter, the court found. This is "far from best practices," Fray-Witzer said. In response to questions from Mohamed's lawyers, SHRM revealed the existence of two other discrimination complaints from employees. One case, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, was settled. The other, filed with a California regulator in 2021, is pending. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, SHRM made DEI a focus of its educational materials. In 2021, a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by SHRM concluded that company leaders should make DEI a strategic priority. It said that DEI is not only "the right thing to do," but research shows DEI leaders outperform their competitors financially. In July 2024, SHRM jettisoned the term "equity" from what it now calls "inclusion and diversity," or I&D, prompting social-media backlash from many members and others in the HR community. SHRM cited Taylor's reasoning for the move in a LinkedIn post that drew nearly 1,000 comments, writing that he has said that "by emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs." In his statement, Taylor said the removal of "equity" from SHRM's messaging was driven by data indicating that the word is confusing and polarizing. "While we fully respect some employees and some SHRM members didn't agree with that decision, we are very clear all workplace I&D strategy should be legally compliant, workplace unifying, and business accretive," Taylor said. In recent years, many employers have pulled back or ended DEI programs, concluding the programs were misguided or facing pressure from conservative activists and the second Trump administration. Because SHRM spent years producing DEI materials for HR leaders, its shift was conspicuous, said Don A. Moore, a leadership and communication professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. For some staffers, concerns about SHRM's shift away from DEI were exacerbated by Taylor's connection to the Trump administration. Bloomberg Law reported that Taylor was among those being discussed as a potential labor secretary in Trump's second term, while he chaired an advisory board focused on HBCUs and served on the White House Workforce Policy Advisory Board in the first administration. Taylor has personally supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years. SHRM spent $1 million to $2 million annually on lobbying in recent years, US Senate filings show. Paul Lalonde, who has worked in HR for more than a decade and lives in the Chicago area, said Taylor and SHRM are "kowtowing" to the Trump administration. Lalonde said he declined to renew his SHRM membership in response. SHRM's shift away from DEI has impacted its business relationships. In 2024, the American Heart Association pulled out of a partnership with SHRM's affiliated charitable foundation, partially in connection with the group's move away from a focus on equity, according to three people with knowledge of the relationship. The groups had collaborated on a report on racial gaps in healthcare access and outcomes that led to the SHRM Foundation being paid at least six figures, according to two people. Representatives for SHRM and AHA characterized the amounts paid as "modest" or "routine." Greg Donaldson, an AHA spokesman, said its contract with SHRM's foundation expired and was not renewed because of a change in "strategic direction" and said it would be "inaccurate" to say the collaboration ended over the word "equity." Burke, the SHRM spokesperson, said the American Heart Association was "a valued member" and said SHRM looks "forward to continuing to explore ways of working with them in the future." SHRM hit a nerve with some in the HR community again with the choice of anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck as a conference speaker last month, alongside Van Jones, a CNN host and entrepreneur, and Taylor, who moderated the conversation. Starbuck has repeatedly called DEI "poison." At the event, he said he believes "equity" is a "Marxist concept." "Diversity is one of the most pressing and polarizing issues for our workforces," Taylor said in a LinkedIn video announcing the event. "To move our organizations forward, we must leave behind the echo chambers and lean into difficult conversations." SHRM also changed the event's name to Blueprint from its previous moniker, Inclusion. Shari Dunn, a DEI consultant and author in Portland, Oregon, who is Black, said she found Starbuck's speaking invitation offensive. She canceled her membership over the organization's retreat from DEI principles. "They claim this is a free exchange of ideas and they're just trying to bring different opinions," she said. "My humanity and intelligence can't be a 'different opinion.'" Not all SHRM members opposed Starbuck's participation. Dave Greenlaw, an HR executive in Washington D.C., previously told Business Insider that he planned to attend even though he disagreed with Starbuck. He said he believed HR leaders need to understand the full corporate landscape, even when it might be uncomfortable. In a statement to Business Insider, Starbuck said he spent two hours taking photos with conference attendees after he finished speaking. "So clearly, not every HR professional felt distressed to have my voice included," he said. "It was nice to have a productive conversation with Johnny and Van about making workplaces less divisive." Some of SHRM's members have said publicly they would cancel their membership, which gives them access to templates, legal information, and other resources. Membership revenue increased in 2024, from $69 million to $75.6 million, according to its tax filings. Figures for 2025 aren't yet available. SHRM said its overall membership number has grown about 16% over the course of Taylor's tenure. At least part of last year's revenue increase may have been due to an 8% price hike for the annual membership that took place in February 2024. The cost of an annual membership rose by another 13% earlier this year, to $299. Taylor's total compensation has also grown. He received $4 million last year, more than five times what he made in 2018 and a 48% increase from what he was paid in 2022. Taylor started his career as a law-firm associate, and then went on to serve in legal and HR roles at companies including Paramount Pictures, Alamo Rent a Car, and Blockbuster, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining SHRM, Taylor led the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a nonprofit that supports historically and predominantly Black schools, from 2010 to 2017. Business Insider identified two appearance-related complaints during his tenure. The organization settled a discrimination lawsuit filed by an employee, Tara Smith, who said she was fired for refusing to wear pantyhose to business meetings. The fund said Smith had been insubordinate. In his statement, Burke said that Taylor "refused to settle this lawsuit because he believed it was meritless, and even when the organization settled it after his departure, he refused to participate in the settlement." A student also launched a Change.org petition signed by more than 6,800 people in opposition to the organization's ban on dreadlocks for male participants in its Leadership Institute. The student wrote that his acceptance was rescinded because of his hairstyle and called the policy "discriminatory, sexist, and contrary to TMCF's mission of supporting" students from historically Black colleges and universities. TMCF did not respond to a request for comment. At SHRM, meanwhile, Taylor has said the organization talks "policy, not politics." Roger King, a longtime employment lawyer with the CHRO Association, an HR policy organization, said Taylor deserves credit for growing SHRM's membership and talking openly about the group's decision-making on diversity topics. "Many in the business community have gone silent, or certainly have reduced their rhetoric, on this whole issue," he told Business Insider. On TikTok, Kinsey and Schmidt, who both worked on SHRM's social media team, have posted roughly a dozen videos about their experiences at the organization. The videos have been collectively viewed more than 1 million times. Kinsey said the group's treatment of its workers shows "hypocrisy," while Schmidt compared his work at SHRM to "the marketing department for the Death Star." "I highly encourage you to never give a dollar to this organization," Schmidt said in one video. It was filmed in SHRM's offices. Have a tip? Know more? Reach Sarah E.

Title: I was laid off by Meta and became a boomerang employee 3 years later. Here's why I decided to return.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Devang Sharma, a 27-year-old senior software engineer at Meta, based in Menlo Park, CA. The following has been edited for length and clarity. The first time I joined Meta was in 2022. I uprooted my life in London and moved to Toronto to work there. I stayed for around four and a half months before being laid off. Meta is an amazing organization, one I saw myself retiring at, but there was nothing I could do to keep my job. Three years later, a recruiter from Meta reached out to me, and I had the chance to rejoin the company in a much more senior role. I had offers from other AI companies, but returning to Meta felt like a homecoming. With the direction of the industry, there's always a chance of layoffs; however, I saw coming back as a trade-off. I was working at a startup as an engineer before I applied for the Meta software engineering position in Toronto. When I was impacted by company layoffs, it was really challenging to deal with, especially as an immigrant. It was the middle of winter, and I had just left everything I knew behind in London. But I was still grateful for the first experience I had working at such a large scale. I was not dependent on Meta for my immigration status because I got my permanent residency, so I was free to switch jobs. Within a month, I secured several offers and landed a new role. There are LinkedIn groups, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and email newsletters for former Meta employees. I was always in touch with the former and current employees I worked with, as well as those I had not worked with directly. The conversations were mostly regarding what's happening across the industry and also within Meta. With the recent movements and investments in AI, a lot has changed over the past two and a half to three years. Meta has an internal system that tracks and enables them to reach out to current and former employees. A Meta recruiter emailed me about a specific role and team, and when I got more details about the position, I realized it was exactly what I was looking for. The interviews were similar to my first time interviewing with them in terms of coding standards and system design, but more complex in terms of tangible design problems. I was in the interview process with other organizations and considering their offers. This made me sort of unsure whether to proceed with Meta. Before rejoining Meta, I was working at Amazon. Although I had the opportunity to work with some great AI models, I was not directly contributing to the foundational models or writing the models myself. My role was primarily focused on implementing and fine-tuning. When I discovered that I could contribute to the domain of artificial intelligence firsthand by building and writing models, not just on the implementation side, which perfectly aligned with what I was looking for, I was thrilled. I'm in my 20s and I don't have a family. I'm pretty flexible in terms of my responsibilities. I couldn't sit back and be fearful about what would happen if there were more layoffs. There will probably be some, but I can't control it. I would've regretted not taking a chance to work on something amazing, simply because I chose a safe route. I had such a mixture of emotions going into my new hire orientation, this time at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park. It brought back all the memories of my first time joining the company back in Toronto. I knew that employees who worked at headquarters got to meet people like Chris Cox, the chief product officer of Meta, and other C-suite executives. Back in 2022, at the Toronto office, we were just watching them on video. In 2025, I was sitting in the front row while Chris Cox gave an amazing speech. Things have changed since I last worked here. Priorities differ, and the company is leaner, so things move more quickly. The company's evolution in terms of shipping features is happening at a very fast pace; it's no longer a traditional software engineering role. It's more about how integrated we are with AI. Whenever you're returning to a previous organization that you have worked with, it feels like a homecoming because there's naturally some attachment there. My piece of advice would be to try to come in with the mindset of a newbie. I'm using my previous experience to help me, but I'm also thinking of this new experience as if I were joining Meta for the first time. This approach has helped me overcome my prejudices. It's given me a chance to be a curious learner, and that's one of the most important things that you can do as a professional. Do you have a story to share about being a boomerang employee?

By Brendan Hesse and Jon Bitner on November 23, 2025 at 12:00AM PST GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. If you're searching for elusive Amiibo this holiday season, consider taking a peek at Best Buy during its Black Friday Sale event. The retailer currently has Amiibo in stock that are sold out at most other locations--including several that have been out of print for years. Many of these are available for their original $16 MSRP, undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including the recently released Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures. You can also pick up the Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. You can also grab The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo for $20 each, down from their usual $30. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock right now, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections. Below you'll find a list of all of the Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy $20 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $20 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $20 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 If the Kirby Air Riders series feels a bit too expensive, you can instead check out this old Amiibo from 2016. Featuring Kirby traveling on a Warp Star, it's just $16 at Best Buy right now. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Title: PE Firms Flood Junk Debt Market to Pay Themselves

Private equity firms, struggling to find buyers for their investments, are turning to an old playbook like never before. Financial sponsors are extracting cash from their portfolio companies by raising debt to fund payouts to themselves and their investors at an unprecedented clip. Such dividend loans have hit $28.7 billion so far this year, putting them on track to surpass 2021’s record $28.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their efforts come as the private equity machine hits snarls at nearly every turn: Attractive takeover targets are sparse and it’s harder to cash out old investments and deliver the returns once promised to pension managers, foundations and wealthy individuals. To quell impatient investors, buyout shops are increasingly layering extra borrowing on their companies and funneling the proceeds of debt sales to their stakeholders instead. “All the stars are aligned for dividend recaps; rates are coming down, spreads are tight, the market is open — yet the IPO market and M&A are still subdued,” Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, said. “Investors want distributions, and dividend recaps can buy PE firms more time to wait for a better environment for exits.” Private equity firms have routinely used dividend recapitalizations to book profits and take skin out of the game after they acquire companies. Such deals can be seen as controversial and aggressive, often leading debt investors — fearing the strain of the additional debt — to push back. But with demand for loans likely outpacing supply of new debt this year, borrowers have an upper hand. This month, private equity firm Thoma Bravo priced a $750 million loan for cybersecurity firm Darktrace to fund a distribution to shareholders, in what Fitch Ratings called “an aggressive financial policy with high leverage.” In October, Thoma Bravo raised debt on Ping Identity Holding Corp. to help fund a roughly $1 billion payout. Earlier this year, another one of its portfolio companies, Proofpoint Inc., obtained a $1.35 billion loan to fund a payment to the buyout firm and employees. Other recent deals included a $1.35 billion leveraged loan by yogurt maker Chobani Inc. to partly finance a payout. Buyout firms and their clients are relying on alternative methods to unlock cash. They’re shuffling assets out of older vehicles into what are known as continuation funds, selling stakes on the secondary market and borrowing against holdings through complex loans with high interest rates. The industry’s fund distributions have slowed so drastically that, at the current rate, it would take about nine years for customers to collect their money from the more than 12,000 companies held by US buyout funds, according to Pitchbook. That’s making limited partners reluctant to step up fresh capital, with Bain & Co. estimating in a mid-year report that there were more than 18,000 private capital funds seeking $3.3 trillion. “The reason that sponsors are doing it, and driving most of this, is realistically because they have struggled to monetize their investments,” Matthew Mish, head of public and private credit strategy at UBS Group AG, said. “The IPO market has started to thaw but is not really providing an exit. The LPs are not getting their money back.” Scarce Supply Helping fuel the dividend deals is the market’s supply-demand dynamic. Roughly $915 billion of loans have been sold in 2025, about 16% lower than the same period last year. Of that debt, some 80% has been for loan refinancings and repricings, meaning there has been relatively little new debt to buy. Another driver is collateralized loan obligations, structured credit vehicles that are the largest buyers of leveraged loans. CLOs are financed by issuing bonds. There have been more than $151 billion of the debt backed by syndicated loans sold in 2025, up about 4.7% from the same time last year, according to the Bloomberg data. “The problem is the deals aren’t performing. And so when they don’t perform, even if I want to sell mine, I’m not going to sell it to the other PE guy that knows that he has his own deals that aren’t performing and he doesn’t want mine,” Mish said. “The easiest thing to do is to do a recapitalization and sell it to a less credit discriminate investor, which is a CLO.” Click here for a podcast with Vanguard on reservations it has on junk bonds Week In Review On the Move With assistance from Dan Wilchins. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: These Are the 3 Biggest Stocks in Alphabet’s Secret Portfolio

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © NicoElNino / Shutterstock.com Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is often seen as a core tech giant focused on search, advertising, and cloud computing. Yet beneath its main operations lies a quieter side: a venture arm that invests in promising companies in areas like space tech, geospatial data, and semiconductors. These bets target innovations adjacent to Alphabet’s ecosystem, such as enhanced connectivity for Android devices, Earth observation for AI-driven mapping in Google Earth, and efficient chip designs for data centers powering Google Cloud. Through GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG, Alphabet manages a portfolio of about 37 public stocks valued at $2.5 billion to $3 billion as of late 2025. The three largest positions — AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS), Planet Labs (NYSE:PL), and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) — highlight its strategy of backing high-growth plays in satellite networks, imaging analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. AST SpaceMobile tops Alphabet’s portfolio with a stake worth approximately $459 million at current prices, representing 18% of its equity holdings. The company aims to build a satellite-based cellular network that connects unmodified smartphones directly from space, eliminating dead zones in remote areas. Alphabet’s interest stems from synergies with Android, with plans to enable seamless SpaceMobile connectivity on billions of devices worldwide. This aligns with Alphabet’s push for ubiquitous access to its services, like Maps and YouTube, in underserved markets. The $155 million investment in early 2024, followed by an additional $203 million in shares during this year’s first quarter, underscores confidence in ASTS’s partnerships with carriers like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), which serve over 2.5 billion subscribers. Growth prospects look explosive. AST plans nationwide U.S. intermittent service by late 2025, expanding to Canada, Japan, and the U.K. in early 2026. Analysts forecast explosive revenue growth over the next few years, fueled by these deals. With a $1.2 billion cash buffer and a recent $420 million loan, funding for satellite launches is secure. The stock is up 143% year-to-date, despite losing half its value in the past month after missing Wall Street’s Q3 estimates last week. Trading around $52 per share, AST carries risks like execution delays in orbital deployments. For risk-tolerant investors, AST SpaceMobile offers moonshot potential — 50% upside by 2026 according to some models — if it captures even a slice of the $100 billion satellite broadband market. Alphabet’s bet signals it’s worth considering for those eyeing telecom disruption. Planet Labs holds the second spot in Alphabet’s portfolio at $356 million, or about 17% of holdings. Founded by NASA scientists, the company operates a fleet of over 200 satellites capturing daily global imagery, delivering geospatial data for agriculture, finance, defense, and climate monitoring. Alphabet invests here to bolster Google Earth and AI tools: Planet’s archives power environmental analytics, like deforestation tracking, and integrate with Google’s Earth AI models for pixel-level predictions on risks such as cholera outbreaks or hurricanes. This enhances Alphabet’s cloud services for enterprise clients needing real-time Earth intelligence. The growth case is compelling despite current unprofitability. Shares have surged 176% in 2025, trading near $11, but are down 33% from the highs hit last month. Fiscal Q2 backlog exploded 245% year-over-year to $736 million — 2.6 times fiscal 2026 revenue guidance — signaling locked-in demand. Analysts project 20% topline growth through 2027, driven by AI-enhanced subscriptions and government contracts. Partnerships with Airbus and the World Health Organization add credibility. At a 13.1 price-to-sales ratio, valuation feels stretched amid $22.6 million Q2 losses, but improving margins from fleet efficiencies could flip to profits by 2027. Wall Street’s “Buy” consensus targeting $14.55 per share implies 30% upside, but aggressive investors may buy for the 18% annual revenue growth forecast, outpacing the aerospace sector. Alphabet sees untapped value in data monetization, making PL a solid pick for thematic exposure to geospatial AI. Arm Holdings rounds out Alphabet’s top trio with a stake valued at around $258 million, roughly 11.5% of the portfolio. As a designer of energy-efficient CPU architectures, Arm licenses blueprints used in 99% of smartphones and increasingly in data centers. Alphabet’s investment ties directly to Google Cloud: Arm’s designs underpin custom chips like the Axion processor, offering 60% better performance-per-watt than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rivals, slashing costs for AI workloads. This supports Alphabet’s hyperscale needs, where Arm expects 50% data center CPU share by the end of 2025. Fiscal Q2 2026 revenue topped $1 billion (up 34% year-over-year), with royalties jumping 21% on Armv9 adoption. Q3 guidance calls for 25% revenue growth to $1.17 billion to $1.28 billion, fueled by smartphones, autos, and cloud. Analysts forecast 21% long-term earnings growth, pushing shares from $131 to a $168 target — 28% upside. The stock is up just 6% year-to-date after getting cut 28% during the market’s recent slide, but trades at a lofty 167 P/E. Still, partnerships with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SoftBank, plus Compute Subsystems royalties, position Arm for dominance in edge AI.

Amazon Inc has done the largest workforce reduction in its history, which hit the engineering roles the most. Four in 10 employees were engineers in the latest 14,000 job cuts, WARN data showed. The company announced the layoffs on October, 2025. The move impacted all segments of its business, from cloud services, to retail, advertising, and groceries. Amazon Inc submitted the records of job reduction for New York, California, New Jersey, Washington, and show how sharply engineering was affected. Around 40% were in engineering positions of the 4,700 layoffs recorded in the state, according to data Amazon provided through Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings. WARN data showed that the cuts affected engineers at various levels but disproportionately hit software development engineering staff or the mid-level software developers. The layoffs affected more than 500 product managers and programme managers across states that field notice. They account for 10% of the total job cuts. Another section which bore the hardest hit was the gamining segment. California's WARM data showed that significant reduction in its San Diego and Irvine Studios as well as central publishing. There is no data for other states, which indicates that the figure is only a part of wider cuts. The workforce reduction happened as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy continued to overhaul for the company's internal culture. Amazon said that the artificial intelligence was not the main reason behind the layoffs. The company has reduced the workforce to reduce layers, speeding up decisions. Another wave of job cut is due on January, 2026.

Shares of an off-price apparel retailer climbed after the company touted its success in the back-to-school season and issued a rosy outlook for the critical holiday quarter. Meanwhile, a database software firm remained under pressure as questions linger about its valuation and capacity to meet lofty targets. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back Friday, clawing back losses posted in the prior session. The S&P 500 ended the final trading session of the week 0.9% higher. The Dow added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8%. See here for Investopedia's full wrap-up of Friday's major market moves. Shares of Ross Stores (ROST) surged 8.4% after the off-price apparel, footwear, and accessories retailer surpassed third-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company is the latest discount retailer to demonstrate it's benefiting from consumers' bargain-seeking. Ross highlighted strength in the back-to-school shopping season and raised its outlook, pointing to optimism about the crucial holiday period. Comments from John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helped boost expectations that policymakers might cut interest rates in December. Rate-cut optimism boosted the stocks of companies exposed to the housing market, which stand to benefit from lower mortgage rates. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.1%, while homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) also notched solid gains. Insulet (PODD) shares climbed 5.8% a day after the medical device maker held an investor day event. The manufacturer of continuous glucose monitoring devices provided a three-year sales and profit forecast that exceeded consensus expectations. Several research firms raised their price targets on Insulet stock following the event. Oracle (ORCL) shares tumbled 5.7%, extending their recent downtrend and suffering the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock Friday. The database software and cloud computing giant has been rattled recently by concerns about its elevated valuation and heavy borrowing tied to its data center investments. Following Friday's drop, the stock is down around 28% over the past month. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid 1% as concerns about an AI bubble continued to weigh on high-flying tech stocks. Friday's decline extended the stock's 3% loss yesterday despite the AI chip giant blowing past estimates with its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's largest rivals, Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), shed 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), whose stocks soared over the past year as they struck multi-billion dollar deals to power AI data centers, were also dogged by bubble fears. Their stocks fell a respective 3% and 2.2%.

Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since.

Title: Amazon Ring Workers Ordered to Relocate Amid ‘AI-Powered’ Push

(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring division has ordered hundreds of customer service workers to relocate to central hubs in the US and UK amid a companywide push to streamline and automate operations. The affected personnel, who have been working remotely, will have to report to offices in Hawthorne, California; North Reading, Massachusetts; Tempe, Arizona; or London, according to a memo sent earlier this month and reviewed by Bloomberg. Hundreds of workers will have to relocate to keep their jobs, according to two people familiar with the matter. In the memo, Amazon’s video doorbell unit said it was looking to transform the customer service department into a “proactive, AI-powered support ecosystem.” A subset of workers who deal directly with customers, along with their supervisors, can still work remotely, the memo said. The department also supports Amazon’s Blink camera and home security brand. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the relocation requirement and declined to comment further. In June, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI tools capable of performing human tasks would likely shrink the company’s workforce. Four months later, Amazon announced it was eliminating 14,000 corporate positions. The latest job cuts roiled a workforce already grappling with several previous rounds of layoffs and an order to return to the office five days a week. Some employees see the relocation and return-to-office policies as efforts to force people to quit without Amazon having to pay severance. The company denies that and estimated in October that severance costs had reached $2 billion this year as of Sept. 30. Ring’s relocation mandate will likely prompt a large number of customer-service staff to leave, according to one affected employee, who requested anonymity to avoid possible retaliation. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company as CEO earlier this year and has made clear that AI will play an important role in its future. --With assistance from Matt Day.

CURRENCY OBSOLETE: Billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday speculated money may become irrelevant in the future if current artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics innovations continue. SCANDAL SPIRAL: Former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Larry Summers resigned from the board of OpenAI amid the fallout over his correspondence with disgraced late financier Jeffery Epstein.

(Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg via Getty Images/ Rick Friedman Photography/Corbis via Getty Images) HIGH-TECH: The General Services Administration struck a deal with Perplexity AI to offer the company's artificial intelligence services to every government agency for 25 cents each, making it the 21st contract under the OneGov initiative. PRIME USERS: The artificial intelligence-related layoffs sweeping corporate America could impact prime loan borrowers, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said. ROBOT NATION: Amazon is doubling down on artificial intelligence and robotics to remake work inside its warehouses and fulfillment centers, even as it cuts thousands of corporate roles and faces growing fears about machines replacing human workers. UNITED WE STAND: The artificial intelligence boom promises to be more eventful than the dawn of the internet. It will lead to a higher quality of life for everyone in the first country to achieve AI dominance. AI is already being harnessed for cancer detection and for developing self-driving vehicles that will lower traffic fatalities.

(Shawn Thew/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images) ROBOT TAKEOVER: As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into daily life, voters hold mixed views about how (and when) it will shape their lives — and whether that impact will be positive. MAJOR MOVE: The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would direct the Justice Department to sue states that enact their own laws regulating artificial intelligence, according to a draft reviewed by Fox News Digital. OPINION: HUGH HEWITT: The fact of an "AI bubble" is real. Nobody knows when it will pop. Nobody knows the consequences. But, it is impossible to miss its giant presence in the world of investing and the downstream political consequences when it pops. 'ART OF WAR': In her first joint visit with second lady Usha Vance, first lady Melania Trump met with troops and military families, praising the Marine Corps' 250 years of service while warning that artificial intelligence (AI) will redefine modern warfare and America’s defense. GONE ROGUE: Texas mom Mandi Furniss sounded the alarm over AI chatbots after she alleged one from Character.AI — one of the leading platforms for AI technology — drove her autistic son toward self-harm and violence. MILITARY SUPERIORITY: The Department of War is narrowing its research and development strategy to six "Critical Technology Areas" officials say will speed up innovation and strengthen America’s military edge. MISSING THE BOAT: Democrats in Washington are losing the AI conversation. Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it. DC Democrats need to reclaim the issue of AI from Republicans.

Title: Layoffs are piling up, raising worker anxiety. Here are some companies that have cut jobs recently

© 2025 Griffin Media. Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Legal Notices, EEO Report, Ad Choices, Public Inspection File Contact, KWTV Public Inspection File, KSBI Public Inspection File, Closed Captioning Assistance, FCC Applications, VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) It’s a tough time to be looking for a job. Amid wider economic uncertainty, some analysts have said that businesses are at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill. That’s caused many to limit new work to only a few specific roles, if not pause openings entirely. At the same time, sizable layoffs have continued to pile up — raising worker anxieties across sectors. Some companies have pointed to rising operational costs spanning from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs and shifts in consumer spending. Others cite corporate restructuring more broadly — or, as seen with big names like Amazon, are redirecting money to artificial intelligence. Federal employees have encountered additional doses of uncertainty, impacting worker sentiment around the job market overall. Shortly after Trump returned to office at the start of the year, federal jobs were cut by the thousands. And the record 43-day government shutdown also left many to work without paychecks. The impasse put key economic data on hold, too. In a delayed report released Thursday, the Labor Department said U.S. employers added a surprising 119,000 jobs in September. But unemployment rose to 4.4% — and other troubling details emerged, including revisions showing the economy actually lost 4,000 jobs in August. There’s also growing gender and racial disparities. The National Women’s Law Center notes women only accounted for 21,000 of September’s added jobs — and that Black women over the age of 20, in particular, saw unemployment climb to 7.5% for the month. The shutdown has left holes in more recent hiring numbers. The government says it won’t release a full jobs report for October. Here are some of the largest job cuts announced recently: In November, Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company. General Motors moved to lay off about 1,700 workers across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio in late October, as the auto giant adjusts to slowing demand for electric vehicles. Hundreds of additional employees are reportedly slated for “temporary layoffs” at the start of next year. In long-awaited cuts just months after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount plans to lay off about 2,000 employees — about 10% of its workforce. Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs in late October, according to a source familiar with the matter. In November, Paramount also announced plans to eliminate 1,600 positions as part of divestitures of Televisión Federal in Argentina and Chilevision in Chile. And the company said another 600 employees had chosen voluntary severance packages as part of a coming push to return to the office full-time. Amazon said last month that it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, close to 4% of its workforce, as the online retail giant ramps up spending on AI while trimming costs elsewhere. A letter to employees said most workers would be given 90 days to look for a new position internally. United Parcel Service has disclosed about 48,000 job cuts this year as part of turnaround efforts, which arrive amid wider shifts in the company’s shipping outputs. UPS also closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings during the first nine months of this year. Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions, or about 8% of its corporate workforce globally. The retailer said the cuts were part of wider streamlining efforts. In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years. In September, Lufthansa Group said it would shed 4,000 jobs by 2030 — pointing to the adoption of artificial intelligence, digitalization and consolidating work among member airlines. Also in September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition. Oil giant ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, as part of broader efforts from the company to cut costs. Between 2,600 and 3,250 workers were expected to be impacted, with most layoffs set to take place before the end of 2025. Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs — with the struggling chipmaker working to revive its business. In July, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end the year with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of last year. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction. In May, Microsoft began laying off about 6,000 workers across its workforce. And just months later, the tech giant said it would be cutting 9,000 positions — marking its biggest round of layoffs seen in more than two years. The company has cited “organizational changes,” but the labor reductions also arrive as the company spends heavily on AI. In June, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures. © 2025 Griffin Media.

Despite Nvidia Corp. reporting blockbuster fiscal third-quarter earnings that easily surpassed consensus estimates, the market's reaction demonstrated that valuation concerns and uncertainty about the sustainability of the AI boom continue to hold investor sentiment firmly in bearish territory. The chipmaker, whose graphics processing units are the essential bedrock of the current AI revolution, reported revenue of $57 billion late Wednesday, exceeding expectations and issuing similarly robust guidance for the current period, projecting fourth-quarter sales of $65 billion. The results, fueled by seemingly insatiable demand from hyperscalers like Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, should have ignited a sector-wide rally. Instead, the surge proved short-lived. Nvidia’s stock, which initially jumped in after-hours trading and opened sharply higher on Thursday, rapidly reversed course, closing the session down approximately 3.15%. The dramatic reversal in the market’s AI bellwether dragged the entire technology sector down with it, contributing to a 2.2% plunge for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index that day. The week’s action was a stark manifestation of a broader debate raging among institutional investors: whether the multi-year AI rally has inflated into a speculative bubble. This skepticism is evidenced by a noticeable market rotation into defensive sectors. Throughout November, professional fund managers have been moving capital out of high-growth technology and AI-adjacent stocks and into sectors like healthcare, which have substantially outperformed the broader market. Tech, meanwhile, has been the S&P 500’s worst-performing sector this month. Other key AI infrastructure plays followed Nvidia’s slide. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped nearly 8%, and other chipmakers contributed to the sell-off, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index declining nearly 5% on Thursday. The bearish sentiment was particularly painful for pure-play AI software vendors, many of which lack the established cash flows and diverse revenue streams of the Big Tech titans. C3.ai Inc. (AI), a prominent enterprise AI application provider, saw its stock price decline over the five-day period, underscoring the vulnerability of companies whose entire valuation rests on the promise of rapidly scaling AI revenue. The stock began the week trading around $13.44 per share but retreated steadily and was down 5% over the past five days, according to Yahoo Finance. This decline means C3.ai's shares are down more than 26% in the past month, a sign that investors are reassessing the risk associated with its current business model ahead of its December earnings report. The company faces stiff competition from major cloud providers now aggressively pushing their own AI platforms, and concerns remain regarding the long path to profitability for enterprise AI solutions. The divergence between Nvidia’s underlying business strength and the stock market’s lukewarm reception illustrates that while the AI revolution is undoubtedly real, investors are no longer willing to underwrite the sector’s current valuations without clearer signs of sustained, broad-based commercialization—outside of the largest cloud and chip companies.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Monthly Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Yield-Heavy Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Panchenko Vladimir / Shutterstock.com It would be an impressive feat to generate $4,000 in yearly passive income with just $12,500 in your account. Yet, it’s actually possible if you invest $2,500 into five carefully chosen stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). Not only that, but you could get paid cash distributions every month and possibly even every week. The plan is to own high-yield stocks that represent profitable businesses which pay monthly dividends. Also, you can own some ETFs offering big yields and frequent cash payouts. Allocating $2,500 toward the five assets on today’s list means you’d be investing $12,500 in total. It’s possible to earn $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions is you achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 / $12,500 or 32%. Sure, that’s ambitious and these five stocks/ETFs carry some risk; for example, any of the annual yields might get cut. On the other hand, you could become a passive income overachiever simply by holding five assets, so let’s start off with two high-paying stock picks. We’ll begin with Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), a business development company mainly specializing in bank loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Since Oxford Square Capital Corp. sends out its cash dividends on a monthly basis, you can take advantage of frequent reinvestment and compounding opportunities. It’s smart to focus on income-positive businesses in order to mitigate your overall risk level. As it turns out, Oxford Square Capital Corp. is income-positive as it reported roughly $5.56 million of third-quarter 2025 net investment income. At the moment, Oxford Square Capital Corp. offers a 22.46% forward annual dividend yield. This doesn’t measure up to our objective of achieving an average yield of at least 32%. Nevertheless, buying $2,500 worth of OXSQ stock is a good start as we’ll raise the average yield later with some mega-yield ETFs. Another stock you could invest $2,500 into is Orchid Island Capital (NYSE:ORC). This company is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that concentrates on U.S.-based residential mortgage-backed securities. Like Oxford Square Capital Corp., Orchid Island Capital pays dividends every month. Furthermore, Orchid Island Capital is a profitable business enterprise, having recorded $72.08 million in Q3 2025 net income. Being income-positive implies, more or less, that these companies should be able to continue paying monthly cash dividends. Currently, Orchid Island Capital stock investors can expect a 20.14% forward annual dividend yield. We’re still below our 32% average yield target, but there’s no need to fret as I’ve got a three-pack of ETFs that could bring massive payouts. To raise the bar in terms of overall annual yield, you could invest $2,500 into three funds from Roundhill. These ETFs all pay distributions on a weekly basis, so you can continue to receive cash payments every month or even more often than that. To provide a simplified explanation, the following Roundhill ETFs trade shares of a well-known stock as well as a type of derivatives known as swaps. This typically raises the risk level but also enables substantial income-generation opportunities. First, we have the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AMZW), which trades shares and swaps to indirectly extract income from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. Unlike a direct investment in Amazon stock, you’ll receive weekly cash distributions if you hold AMZW shares. Clarifying the fund’s objective, Roundhill explains that the AMZW ETF targets “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of AMZN stock. The expected annual distribution rate of the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF is quite hefty at 37.57%. Next up is the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:TSLW), which uses similar trading strategies to indirectly derive income from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. In particular, the TSLW ETF aims for “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of TSLA stock. There’s risk involved as the share price of the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF may be volatile. However, it’s hard to resist the fund’s massive 53.28% annual distribution rate, no doubt. Then there’s the Roundhill AVGO WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AVGW), which attempts to achieve similar results with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Again, the share-price volatility risk shouldn’t be overlooked, but the AVGW ETF’s gigantic 54.68% distribution rate makes it a worthwhile addition to this list. So, have we reached or objective of a 32% or higher average annual yield? To fond out, we just need to add up the expected yields of OXSQ, ORC, AMZW, TSLW, and AVGW and then divide the total by five. The result is a 37.63% average annual yield between these five stocks/ETFs. Thus, we’ve put together a plan to earn at least $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions (assuming there are no yield cuts) with monthly or even weekly cash payments to your account.

Title: Tech Stocks That Are Down Today: AMD, Palo Alto Networks, DataDog and Micron Technology

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alexgo.photography / Shutterstock.com After yesterday’s debacle in which approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization was erased from the stock market, some technology stocks are still hunting a bottom. With the Nasdaq Composite now down 3% for the month of November so far, the AI rally has lost its steam for the time being as the markets wrestle with bullish fundamentals overshadowed by negative headlines. While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.

While the selling hasn’t been pretty for the bulls, it does not appear to be over, at least not yet. The following technology stocks – Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU), Data Dog (Nasdaq: DDOG), Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) and Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW) – are heading lower today in a most volatile time to be invested in the U.S. stock market. After sinking as much as 11% in Thursday’s market sell-off, and even dipping below the psychologically sensitive $200 threshold, the bottom has seemingly fallen out in the stock. Today MU stock is down another 3.6%. Investors have been spooked by Micron’s aggressive AI capex plans in which management conceded that its $18 billion plan would face headwinds. Investors are having to get used to these massive balance sheets committed massive amounts of capital to stay in the AI race. Also, profit taking is normal with a stock that has run up over 100% year-to-date. Rosenblatt has a whopping $300 price target on the stock, owing to its massive total addressable market and leaving room for plenty of upside potential. Morgan Stanley analysts are targeting a very bullish $325 stock price with an “overweight” rating. Therefore investors might look to any pullback in the stock as a potentially strategic buying opportunity but not for the faint of heart. After spiraling by 9.5% on Thursday, Datadog is widening its losses today, falling 3.4% as of mid-morning trading. After nearing the $200 level in November, Datadog has taken a step backwards, threatening to fall below the $150-per-share level in recent days. Year-to-date, the stock is up 8.2%, and Wall Street analysts are bullish with an average price target of $218 attached. With OpenAI integration a bullish sign, today’s declines may be technical in nature, as there is no apparent negative catalyst, but the declines are still hitting investor portfolios hard. After losing 7.8% in Thursday’s market downturn, Advanced Micro Devices stock can’t get out of its own way. AMD stock has now dipped below the $200 level, falling a steep 4% in today’s session. AMD clinched its latest all-time high last month when it rose as high as $264 per share, and investors may be taking profits off the table. AMD also has a spot in the coveted OpenAI club, having clinched a recent partnership with the maker of ChatGPT. The consensus is that the stock is worth close to $300 per share, but the ride up is likely going to be bumpy. After falling 7.4% yesterday, Palo Alto Networks is down a further 1.2% today. The cybersecurity company reported earnings and suffered a downgrade by HSBC, which lowered its view on the stock from “hold” to “reduce” with a price target of $157. PANW announced a merger in which it is buying a cloud-management company in a $3.3 billion transaction, which as the buyer could also be weighing on the stock.

Title: Amazon layoffs: Tech giant’s mega job-cut drive eliminated this one specific role the most, data shows

Amazon had in October announced that it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees. The Amazon layoffs, its largest in three years, have affected every part of the company's businesses — rom cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. However, one job category saw the most impact — engineers. According to a report by CNBC citing documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington, about 40% of the nearly 4,700 job cuts in these places were engineering roles. Amazon, which joined several other big tech companies in announcing major layoffs, reported the data in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies. The filings, which represent a segment of the data, show that the Amazon layoffs in October impacted a mix of software engineer levels. However, SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were affected disproportionately. This comes despite human resources chief Beth Galetti said in her memo announcing the Amazon layoffs mentioned that the company now specifically needs engineers as it moves on to manage work with fewer people. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Galetti wrote. “We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” she added. According to the report by CNBC quoting WARN data, over 500 product managers and program managers were laid off after the October announcement, representing more than 10% of the total job cuts. Senior manager and principal level roles were also eliminated as part of the layoffs at Amazon. Amazon had in October announced that it will cut 14,000 job roles across divisions. The corporate workforce of Amazon comprises about 350,000 personnel, meaning the 14,000 cuts announced in October represent about 4% of that headcount. “The reductions we're sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we're investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers' current and future needs,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, had said in a blog post. CEO Andy Jassy had repeatedly said he was determined to cut management layers and ease bureaucracy that began afflicting Amazon after a pandemic-era hiring binge.

Title: Here’s why Wall Street is starting to place bets on BofA’s famously risk-averse CEO
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/business/wall-street-is-starting-to-place-bets-on-bofa-ceo-brian-moynihan/
Time Published: 2025-11-21T14:34:21Z
Full Content:
After Bank America’s first investor day in 14 years, CEO Brian Moynihan is privately declaring victory. For a change, he may have a point. Yes, we’ve been tough on Moynihan on these pages, pointing out how he has shied away from taking calculated risk – a prerequisite for banking and finance – and leaving BofA shares to languish as an also-ran on Wall Street during his long tenure as CEO. But based on some numbers I’ve been crunching following his big shindig two weeks ago, Moynihan is right to do some chest pounding – so far only in private – after he pitched the bank’s evolving business model to investors and analysts. Wall Street sources tell me investors liked what they heard that day from a CEO who until maybe now, has never made the sale about why they should hold stock in the nation’s second-largest bank as opposed to shares of Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest bank. True Dimon is considered the world’s best banker for many reasons including JPM stock price and his own voluble personality. Moynihan, 66, has always been an odd fit in a business dominated by dealmakers and risk takers, like Dimon. His lawyerly temperament is one of caution. He cut his managerial teeth as general counsel of Fleet Boston, which was among the multitude of acquisitions that led to the creation of the modern BofA. He took over as CEO in 2010 after the financial crisis nearly caused BofA to collapse. He did a good job pulling BofA off the mat (its shares traded as low as $3), attracting investor cash from the likes of Warren Buffett and scaling back risk. His problem, critics say, is that he never evolved the bank’s business model. It’s the reason why BofA shares have lagged JPMorgan and all of the Big 6 banks. Investor day was supposed to mark a shift, with Moynihan and a slew of top executives explaining how the bank is now dedicated to producing “responsible growth,” meaning it’s risk-on at BofA – albeit within Moynihanian limits. As of press time, it seems to have worked. Shares are down since the Nov. 5 presentation, but not as much as the markets (correcting due to tech fears) and, more importantly, Moynihan’s key competitors JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Since then, 20 analysts have raised their price targets on BofA shares. I am told that Morgan Stanley lists its stock as its top big bank pick with a price target of $70; it’s currently trading around $50 a share. We weren’t alone tweaking Moynihan as his stock fell around 2% during the festivities. But after the market closed, something interesting happened: While the CEO was on stage answering questions with the executives slated to take his job when he retires in a few years – CFO Alastair Borthwick, Jim DeMare, head of global markets and Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking – shares began to rise in after-hours trading, largely recovering their losses for the day. “We appreciate the positive reaction from investors,” a Bofa spokesman tells On The Money. The day gave our leadership team a chance to comprehensively tell the story of our franchise, how we are growing each of our businesses, and the opportunities for growth in the future.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Of course you can’t erase more than a decade of malaise with just one investor day. If Moynihan’s plan doesn’t lead to better earnings growth, if it fails to meet its all important “return on tangible equity ratio” goal (bank analysts use this number for assessing performance) of 18%, and if it doesn’t improve its stock price, Moynihan’s planned retirement in five years might be expedited. If the progress of the past two weeks is sustained, who knows? He might stay longer. Advertisement

Title: The impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ participation in digital finance: Evidence from China
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0337525

Currently, the development of digital finance in China’s rural areas remains in its early stages. The proportion of rural households participating in digital finance and the types of participation are relatively low. This hinders the realization of digital finance’s inclusive effects. This paper examines the influence of migrant work experience on participation in digital financial of rural households using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The findings suggest that migrant work experience significantly increases the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and increases the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation more for rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Along with the rapid development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet and big data, finance has combined with them to form a new financial business model. Compared to traditional finance, digital finance significantly lowers the barriers to financial services and transaction costs while expanding the reach of financial products [1]. Digital finance provides financial services to underserved populations globally to promote their consumption [2], entrepreneurship [3,4], household welfare [5], and regional economic development [6]. Especially for rural areas beyond the reach of traditional finance, digital finance breaks the geographical limitation of financial services, alleviates financial exclusion and poverty in remote rural areas, and becomes an important way to promote the development of inclusive finance [7,8]. Family digital finance participation refers to the use of digital financial tools such as digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital lending by households. Despite the many benefits of digital finance, the participation rate of Chinese rural households in digital finance is generally low [9]. 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data show that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance was only 20.96% [10]. 2019 Rural survey data from four Chinese provinces show that less than 20% of rural households use more than two digital financial products [11]. 2021 Data from the China Rural Economy and Rural Finance Survey (CRERFS) similarly show that the average number of rural households using three types of digital finance is only 1.025 [12]. In fact, the use of digital finance puts forward higher requirements for farmers’ digital skills and financial knowledge, which makes rural residents with backward economy and low average education level more likely to be excluded [13]. The ability of rural households to participate in digital finance is key to enabling rural households to enjoy the dividends of digital experience development, and improving the well-being of rural residents. Therefore, research on the factors influencing rural households’ digital financial participation has recently attracted increasing attention from scholars and policymakers in developing countries. Existing literature has primarily examined rural households’ participation in digital finance from perspectives including personal financial literacy [14], ICT usage [9], e-commerce adoption [15], regional digital financial development [16], regional network infrastructure [17], and regional pandemic situations [18]. Economists have accumulated a large body of evidence that an individual’s early experiences can have a significant impact on later behavioral decisions. Studies by sociologists and psychologists have found that an individual’s early experiences can have an impact on later decision-making and behavioral competencies [19,20]. First, early experiences have a profound effect on an individual’s later decisions. For example, a manager’s experience can have an impact on his or her later managerial decisions in the firm. CEOs’ international work experience leads to higher compensation [21]. Firms whose CEOs experienced the Chinese famine early in their careers experienced lower stock price declines than firms that did not [22]. Second, early experiences can influence an individual’s ability to behave later in life. For example, work experience can promote pro-social behavior in adolescents [23]. Early grassroots work experience for tax officials enhances their ability to serve as Chinese officials later in life [24]. As one of the significant life experiences for farmers, migration work experience inevitably exerts a considerable influence on their decision-making. However, no literature has yet explored this phenomenon. This paper makes the following key contributions. First, it explores the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ participation in digital finance, thereby enriching the research perspective. Second, it reveals the underlying mechanisms through which migrant work experience influences rural households’ digital finance participation, deepening our understanding of the intrinsic link between migrant work experience and digital finance engagement. Finally, it examines the heterogeneous effects of migrant workers’ work experience on rural households’ digital finance behaviors, providing insights for developing differentiated policies to enhance rural digital finance participation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of migrants’ work experience on the financial vulnerability of rural households and formulates the research hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data, models, and variables used in the empirical study. Section 4 reports the baseline results, robustness tests, and heterogeneity analysis results of the empirical study. Section 5 presents the results of mechanism analysis. Section 6 presents the conclusions and corresponding policy recommendations. Under the influence of urban human capital externalities, migrant workers subconsciously mimic and learn from high-skilled individuals, achieving complementary advantages in skills and resources. This enhances their income, cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, and accumulates human capital, ultimately making their labor experience a key event in their lives. This migrant work experience forms a special kind of memory imprint that retains previous psycho-cognitive patterns and behavioral habits even after the labor force returns home, and has a profound impact on the family’s economic behavioral decisions. It has been shown that migrant work experience positively contributes to farmers’ economic capital, human capital, social capital, and visionary attitudes [25,26], thereby contributing to rural households’ participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance. Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by increasing their level of financial literacy. Financial literacy, as a vital form of human capital, effectively promotes household participation in digital finance by enhancing families’ understanding of financial products and decision-making capabilities [27,28]. After migrating to economically developed cities for work, farmers gain significantly increased access to financial institutions and products such as banks, securities, credit cards, and funds. This exposure continuously broadens their financial horizons and market awareness, ultimately fostering the accumulation of financial knowledge [29]. Moreover, migrant work contributes to increased household income. As earnings rise, farmers develop greater needs for wealth management and asset appreciation, thereby motivating them to proactively acquire financial knowledge [30]. This, in turn, enhances their ability to manage household finances and preserve or grow their assets. The experience of migrant work can facilitate rural households’ participation in digital finance by broadening their social networks. Social networks, as an important informal system, can establish a demonstration effect of rural households’ participation in digital finance [31]. Within social networks, when acquaintances utilize digital financial products and derive benefits from them, they share various information during daily interactions. This not only helps other households broaden their access to information, enabling them to better understand digital finance, but also builds trust in digital financial platforms by disseminating experiences. This reduces feelings of unfamiliarity and apprehension, thereby stimulating willingness to participate in digital finance. Furthermore, social networks foster mutual assistance among members. When encountering difficulties or risks during digital financial activities, individuals can seek advice and support from friends, relatives, and others within their relational networks [32]. This reduces their perceived risks associated with digital finance participation and strengthens their confidence to engage. Migrant work not only allows rural families to maintain their original kinship and geographic networks, but also expands new social networks such as karma and friendships in the new work [33]. Therefore, this article proposes the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Migrant work experience can facilitate rural households’ participation in the digital finance by increasing their financial literacy and expanding their social networks. The data used in this study come from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), which is conducted by the China Household Finance Survey and Research Center of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics on a sample basis every two years, and comprehensively tracks households’ dynamic financial behaviors, providing the researcher with detailed information on household credit, financial assets, and insurance. The data used in this study are from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The CHFS data sample covers 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), 345 counties, and 1,359 communities (villages) nationwide, with a stratified sample of 34,643 households, ensuring strong representativeness. In addition to the demographic characteristics, economic features, and financial literacy information, the 2019 CHFS data also includes household migration and migrant work experiences, as well as participation in digital finance. According to the purpose of the study, the sample of heads of households under 18 years old and those who go out to school are excluded, and the sample data of 9096 rural households are retained after removing the missing values. The per capita GDP data at the regional level comes from the China Statistical Yearbook. This article examines the impact of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation among rural households. Since the explanatory variable whether rural households participate in digital finance is a binary discrete variable, a probit model is constructed. The model is set up as follows: Where is the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation, denotes whether householder has migrant work experience. is a vector of control variables, and is the error term. Since the explanatory variable breadth of household digital finance is a discrete variable with counting characteristics, this paper constructs a Poisson model to analyze the impact of migrant workers’ work experience on the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. The hypothesis probability is determined by the Poisson distribution of parameters, and the model is set up as follows: Where is the number of households using digital financial instruments, is Poisson’s arrival rate, and represents the breadth of farmers’ participation in digital finance. Furthermore, based on the preceding analysis, farmers’ financial literacy and social networks mediate the impact of migrant work experience on their participation in digital finance. Therefore, this article constructs a mediation model to test this. The traditional mediation model does not consider the endogeneity of the mediating variables, and when the mediating variables have endogeneity problems, resulting in the estimation results may be biased. The mediating variables in this article are financial literacy and social networks of farm households, both of which have endogeneity problems such as omitted variables or reverse causality that may exist between them and digital financial participation of rural households. When the intervening variable and the mediating variable are endogenous at the same time, the instrumental variables of the intervening variable and the instrumental variables of the mediating variable need to be utilized to identify the mediating effects. This article builds on the following model [34] by adding instrumental variables for the mediating variables to complete the causal identification of mediating effects: In model (3) are channel variables, including financial literacy and social network. denotes the effect of migrant working experience on each channel variable, is the error term; is the only endogenous variable in the model. In model (4), denotes the direct effect of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation; denotes the effect of channel variables on rural households’ digital financial participation after controlling for the migrant work variable, is the error term; The model includes two endogenous variables, and channel variables. This paper has two explanatory variables: probability of participation in digital finance (Probability of participation in digital finance) and breadth of participation in digital finance (Breadth of Participation in Digital Finance). Based on the definition of digital finance by existing scholars, it mainly refers to traditional financial institutions providing payment, financing, investment and other new types of financial services with the help of digital technology [1]. Therefore, this paper focuses on measuring rural households’ digital finance participation by examining the use of the most frequently used financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance. The questions on digital payment, digital lending, and digital finance management in the questionnaire used are (1) Digital payment: have households used payment methods such as online banking, mobile banking, Alipay, and WeChat? (2) Digital lending: have households used internet borrowing, credit loans or crowdfunding? (3) Digital finance: Have they purchased financial products? The variable of whether to participate in digital finance and the variable of the breadth of participation in digital finance are measured as follows: if a rural household has used any one of the financial instruments such as digital payment, digital lending, digital finance, etc., it is considered to have participated in digital finance, which takes the value of 1, and vice versa 0. The breadth of participation in digital finance is measured by the number of types of digital financial instruments mentioned above that have been used by the rural household. The core explanatory variable in this article is the migratory work experience of the farm household, which takes the value of 1 if the head of the household has lived or worked for more than half a year outside of the province/city where he/she resides, and 0 otherwise. In addition, since this article focuses on work experience, the sample of those who have migrated due to their schooling has been excluded. The mediating variables for this article are financial literacy and social networks. In the measure of financial literacy, considering the differences in the level of financial literacy represented by farmers answering “I don’t know” and answering incorrectly when confronted with a financial literacy question [35], the number of direct answers to financial questions and the number of correct answers to financial questions were used respectively to measure farmers’ financial literacy level. The three main financial literacy questions in the questionnaire include interest question, inflation question, and compound interest question. The questionnaire used contained questions related to financial literacy in three areas: interest, inflation, and compound interest. Interest problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 4% per year, if you deposit 100 yuan for 1 year, the principal and interest you will receive after 1 year will be?; Inflation problem: Assuming that the bank’s interest rate is 5% per year and the inflation rate is 8% per year, what will you be able to buy after one year of saving 100 yuan in the bank?; Compound Interest Problem: If you take out a loan or deposit 10,000 yuan and compound interest at 10% per year, what is the total amount of principal and interest you will need to repay after two years?. For each of the above questions, two dummy variables can be generated for whether or not to answer “don’t know” and whether or not to answer incorrectly, and a total of six dummy variables can be obtained for the three questions, and the factor analysis method is used to get the score of financial literacy of the farmers. In the measure of social network, Rural China is a highly humanized and relational society, and social relationships among people often follow the agreed-upon principle of “exchange of gifts”. Family gift income and expenditure is an important means of maintaining family social network relationships, and can reflect the strength of family social network relationships. Therefore, this article uses the logarithm of the total amount of household gift income and expenditure to measure the level of social networks. In this study, three variables may exhibit endogeneity: migrant work experience, financial literacy, and social networks. This stems from potential omitted variables related to migrant work experience. Simultaneously, household digital financial participation may also exert a reverse effect on financial literacy and social networks. Households with broader participation are more likely to access financial information online and form new social connections, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy and social networks. Therefore, to effectively mitigate estimation biases arising from reverse causality and omitted variables, this study requires establishing corresponding instrumental variables for each endogenous variable, while simultaneously satisfying the requirements of instrument relevance and exclusivity. First, drawing upon existing literature [36,37], this study selects the migration work atmosphere within the village (community) (IV_mw) as an instrumental variable for rural households’ migration work experience. This is measured by the proportion of households within the village (community) that have migration work experience, excluding the interviewed household. In terms of relevance, given the informational network characteristics of rural household migration work [38], households within the same village (community) share work information and experiences, assisting others in migration efforts. When a village has more migrants, the likelihood of the surveyed household engaging in migration work increases. Regarding exclusivity, the migration work environment within villages does not directly influence household participation in digital finance. This is because the migration work environment itself can only provide information or social pressure. Only when households actually engage in migration work will key factors such as income growth, improved financial literacy, and changes in financial needs be directly triggered, thereby driving the use of digital finance. Without actual migration experience, other channels like idea dissemination or peer modeling often yield limited results due to the absence of economic incentives and foundational capabilities. Second, this study selects the interaction term between regional traditional financial development levels and household attention to financial information (IV_fl) as an instrumental variable for financial literacy. It measures traditional financial development levels using the logarithm of regional financial institutions’ loan balances in 2014. The choice of 2014 stems from the fact that China’s digital inclusive finance began rapid development only after the State Council issued the “Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance” in 2015. In terms of correlation, regions with more developed traditional financial sectors provide residents with greater opportunities for both passive exposure and active learning of financial knowledge. Rural households with high attention to financial information are more likely to proactively seek out financial news, market trends, wealth management knowledge, and information from their surroundings, thereby achieving higher levels of financial literacy. Regarding exclusivity, prior to the rise of digital inclusive finance in China, the level of traditional financial development could only influence households’ digital financial participation decisions by affecting their financial literacy. Finally, this study selected the interaction term between the proportion of the region’s most common surname and household financial support provided to non-household members (IV_sn) as an instrumental variable for social networks. In terms of relevance, surnames serve as a key indicator for distinguishing whether rural households belong to the same clan [39]. A higher number of prevalent surnames in a region indicates broader social networks among rural households. Simultaneously, household financial support to non-household members reflects rural households’ capacity for external social interaction, closely linked to expenditures on household social networks. Regarding exclusivity, the proportion of surnames in a village carries distinct clan and cultural characteristics, unaffected by individual household traits. It is unlikely to be influenced by variables other than household social networks, thereby satisfying the exogeneity requirement for the instrumental variable. This paper selects a series of control variables at the level of personal characteristics of farm households, household characteristics and regional characteristics, respectively. Individual characteristics include sex (Gender), age (Age), years of education (Education), marital status (Marriage), and health (Health) of the household head. Household characteristics variables include owner-occupied housing (House), household size (Size), household Elderly dependency ratio (Elder), household Child dependency ratio (Child), total household income (Income), total household assets (Assets), and business engaged in by the household (Commerce). Regional characteristics variables include the logarithm of GDP per capita (Pergdp) and regional dummy variables. Table 1 shows the definitions of the variables. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t001 Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics and mean differences of the main variables. The result of the mean value of rural households’ digital finance participation shows that the proportion of rural households participating in digital finance is 32% and the average breadth of participation in digital finance is 0.368. This indicates that the probability and breadth of digital financial participation are not high. The mean test also revealed that households with migrant work experience exhibit a higher probability and greater breadth of participation in digital finance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t002 Table 3 reports the results of the baseline regressions on the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) find that the coefficients on the impact of migrant work experience on the probability and breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation are positively significant at the 1% statistical level without the inclusion of control variables. The results in columns (2) and (4) find that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability of participation and breadth of participation in digital finance for rural households is also positively significant when all control variables are added. The above results indicate that migrant work experience contributes significantly to both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t003 Among the control variables, the age, education level, and health status of the household head significantly influence rural households’ participation in digital finance. At the household level, household size, business investment, and total assets positively affect households’ digital finance behavior. At the regional level, per capita GDP positively influences households’ digital finance behavior. The household head’s gender, marital status, owner-occupied housing, and total income do not significantly affect households’ digital finance behavior. Although there is no reverse causality between past migrant labor experiences of rural households and current digital financial participation of rural households, the results may still be biased by omitted variables. Table 4 reports the results of the estimation using instrumental variables. Column (1) presents the estimation results using the IV-Probit model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of out-of-home labor experience on the probability of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. Column (2) presents the estimation results using IV-Poisson model. The results show that the coefficient of the effect of migrant labor experience on the breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positively significant at the 1% statistical level. The F-value of 325.37 in the first stage indicates that the selected instrumental variable is not a weak instrumental variable. The results of the endogeneity test show that after considering endogeneity, the migrant work experience still has a positive impact on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation and the breadth of participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t004 Since the migrant work decision-making is not random, but affected by many factors such as individual farmers and households, it may lead to endogenous problems caused by sample self-selection, resulting in biased results. To solve this problem, this paper use the propensity score matching method (PSM) to mitigate this bias. The propensity score method (PSM) could create a near-randomized experiment by identifying the sample that is closest to the treatment and control groups in terms of covariates, in order to reduce estimation bias. In this study, according to whether the farmers have migrant work experience, the sample was divided into families with migrant work experience (treatment group) and families with no migrant work experience (control group).By using the logit model to calculate the propensity score with Participate in digital finance and Breadth of participation as the dependent variables, four common matching methods, namely nearest neighbor matching (K = 3), radius matching, kernel matching and local linear regression matching, were selected to re-estimate the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results of the balance test (S1 Table) show that none of the P-values were significant after matching, indicating that there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups. Table 5 reports the results of the average treatment effect (ATT) of migrant work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households estimated using the PSM. The estimation results of the four matching methods are less different, but all are positively significant at the 1% level. The average treatment effect of outwork experience on the probability of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.085 and 0.102, and the average treatment effect of outwork experience on the breadth of rural households’ digital financial participation ranges between 0.101 and 0.122. The PSM estimation results are relatively close to the baseline regression results, which further validates the robustness of the main findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t005 While the instrumental variable method was used in the previous section to mitigate potential omitted variable problems, it was considered that the use of cross-sectional data also introduces omitted variable bias that may lead to endogeneity problems. To further overcome potential endogeneity problems, this paper will construct balanced panel data for estimation using Chinese household finance data (CHFS) for 2017 and 2019, and the descriptive statistics of the data are shown in S2 Table, and the regression results are shown in Table 6. This paper controls for the same control variables as the baseline regression, except for fixing time and region. The results report that the effect of migrant work experience on both the probability and breadth of digital financial participation of rural households is positive and significant, indicating that migrant work experience has a significant contribution to digital financial participation of rural households. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t006 The exclusivity condition for the instrumental variable of village migration work atmosphere may not be satisfied. While migration work atmosphere can influence digital financial participation through the migration decisions of surveyed households, this may not be the sole pathway. For instance, under peer group effects, the migration work atmosphere within the village exerts the same influence on migration decisions of households other than the surveyed one, with migration experience directly impacting their digital financial participation. In other words, the instrumental variable may indirectly influence the respondent household’s digital financial participation by affecting other households’ engagement. Concurrently, an infrastructure effect may exist: villages with stronger migration work atmospheres may attract more financial institutions and digital infrastructure, thereby enhancing household digital financial participation. Given these considerations, this study incorporates village digital financial participation, rural financial institutions, and rural digital infrastructure as control variables in the model to block these pathways and enhance the exclusivity of the village migration work atmosphere as an instrumental variable. Table 7 shows that after adding these controls, the impact of migration work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation remains robust. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t007 To examine the heterogeneity of the impact of migrant working experience on rural households’ digital financial participation across groups, this paper regresses the sample into groups with respect to the types of work performed during migrant work, long-tail groups, and regional differences, respectively. The type of work during migrant work has an important impact on the ability of migrant workers to effectively accumulate experience, knowledge, and contacts. It is generally recognized that people with formal work or entrepreneurial experience typically not only have higher income levels, but are also more likely to have access to a wealth of information and asset management skills [40], factors that contribute to their better participation in digital financial markets. Table 8 reports the impact of migrants’ formal work experience and migrants’ entrepreneurial experience on rural households’ digital financial participation. The results in columns (1) and (3) show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant formal work experience on the probability of digital financial participation and the breadth of participation of rural households are both significantly positive, suggesting that migrant formal work experience has a greater facilitating effect. The reason is that engaging in formal work usually has a more stable wage income and a clearer compensation system, which makes migrant farm households more confident in investing and borrowing on digital finance platforms and enhances their motivation to participate in digital finance. The results in columns (2) and (4) show that the effect of migrant entrepreneurship experience on the probability of rural households’ digital finance participation is insignificant and the effect on the breadth of digital finance participation is positively significant. The possible explanation is that entrepreneurship itself is characterized by high risk and uncertainty, and many rural households may be wary of digital financial participation because they fear that the use of digital financial products during migrant entrepreneurship may increase financial risk. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t008 The impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation is also likely to vary across farm households’ education levels. This paper examines the sample by dividing it into two groups, those who have not completed compulsory education and those who have completed compulsory education, based on the required number of years of compulsory education in China (9 years).The results in Table 9 show that the marginal contribution of migrant work experience to the probability and breadth of household digital finance participation is greater for farmers who have completed years of compulsory education compared to those who have not completed years of compulsory education. This is because farmers who have completed compulsory education are usually more adaptable and able to acquire digital skills and learn financial literacy more quickly, enabling them to be more willing to engage in digital financial activities and continue to expand the breadth of their participation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t009 In addition, the paper also seeks to understand whether migrant work experiences can facilitate the participation of disadvantaged rural households in digital finance. According to the Long Tail Theory, traditional financial models tend to focus resources on “head” customers at the expense of “tail” customers, and disadvantaged farmers who are excluded from traditional finance are also more likely to be excluded from digital finance. Drawing on existing literature [11], rural households with per capita household incomes below the 2018 Chinese National Poverty Standard Line of 3,200 yuan are defined as the long-tail group. The results in Table 10 show that the coefficients of the impact of migrant work experience on the probability of household digital financial participation and the breadth of participation are larger for the long-tail group than for the non-long-tail group. This suggests that migrant work experience brings more significant marginal improvement effects of cognitive ability enhancement and social network expansion for the long-tail group, which in turn strongly promotes their participation in digital financial activities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t010 How does the migrant work experience contribute to rural households’ participation in digital finance? This section will delve further into the channels and mechanisms through which such experiences may have an impact. Table 11 reports the results of testing the financial literacy mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on financial literacy. The coefficient for the financial literacy variable is significantly positive at the 1% significance level, indicating that migrant work experience positively enhances farmers’ financial literacy. The F-value in the first stage is 317.80, far exceeding the empirical value of 10, confirming that the instrumental variables are not weak. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results for the joint effects of migrant work experience and financial literacy on rural households’ probability and breadth of digital financial participation. Both migrant work experience and financial literacy exhibit positive and significant coefficients. The Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic of 87.228 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming no weak instrumentation issues. Furthermore, considering potential violations of the sequential neglectability assumption, this study adopts the research approach from Ima [41,42] to conduct sensitivity tests on the financial literacy mechanism (S3 Fig). The results confirm that the causal inference of the financial literacy mediation effect is valid and robust. These findings collectively demonstrate that migration work experience promotes rural households’ participation in digital finance by enhancing their financial literacy levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t011 Table 12 reports the results of testing the social network mechanism. Column (1) presents the regression results for the impact of migrant work experience on social networks. The coefficient for the migrant work experience variable is significantly positive at the 1% statistical level, indicating that migrant work experience significantly expands rural households’ social networks. Columns (2) and (3) present regression results examining the joint effects of migrant work experience and social networks on the probability and breadth of household digital financial participation. Both variables exhibit statistically significant positive coefficients at the 1% level. The Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic of 267.015 exceeds the Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 at the 10% level, confirming the absence of weak instrumental variable issues. Sensitivity analysis (S3 Fig) on the social network mechanism confirms the validity and robustness of the causal inference regarding the mediating effect of social networks. These findings demonstrate that migrant work experience promotes rural household participation in digital finance by expanding their social networks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.t012 Insufficient digital financial participation of rural households largely hinders the development of rural inclusive finance and farmers’ access to the dividends of digital economic development. Starting from the new perspective of migrant work experience, this study examines the impact of migrant work experience on rural households’ digital financial participation based on the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data. The study found that migrant work experience is an important influence on rural households’ digital financial participation, significantly contributing to the probability of digital financial participation and increasing the breadth of participation. Heterogeneity analysis finds that migrant work experience promotes digital financial participation of rural households with migrant formal work experience, migrant entrepreneurial experience, completion of compulsory education, and long-tail groups more. Mechanism analysis finds that migrant work experience can influence rural households’ digital financial participation by improving their financial literacy and broadening their social networks. Based on the above research findings, this article puts forward the following policy recommendations. First, while encouraging farmers to seek employment outside their hometowns, the government should focus on optimizing the employment environment and providing robust support to farming households. For instance, this could involve expanding formal employment channels through vocational skills training, or supporting independent entrepreneurship through business guarantees and subsidies. In addition, For migrant working farmers with a low level of education, training in the basics of digital finance is provided on a case-by-case basis, and personalized digital finance guidance services are provided to enhance their willingness to participate in digital finance. Financial institutions should develop low-threshold, flexible and diverse digital financial products to meet the financial needs of low-income migrant working farmers in different scenarios, based on their actual needs. At the same time, the leading role of farmers with high levels of education should be utilized, and these farmers should be encouraged to serve as volunteers or tutors for digital financial education, so as to teach digital financial skills to other farmers and enhance the willingness of farmers with low levels of education to participate in digital finance. Secondly, the Government should further strengthen education and training in rural financial knowledge and expand the social network of migrant working farmers. The government can collaborate with financial institutions to establish dedicated online communication platforms for migrant workers or regularly organize offline forums, providing spaces for them to exchange work and life experiences as well as financial knowledge. This approach enables them not only to share insights on using digital finance face-to-face but also to foster mutual trust and connections, expand their social networks, and ultimately boost the entire group’s enthusiasm for adopting digital financial services. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0337525.s003 (DOCX)

Tesla just got one step closer to deploying its robotaxis commercially in Nevada. Tesla completed the self-certification process for the robotaxi in Nevada, a DMV representative told Business Insider. This step means the company can deploy an autonomous car on Nevada roads, but it still needs approval from the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate commercially. A spokesperson for the NTA told Business Insider that Tesla has yet to submit an application for the permit. Clearing self-certification in Nevada comes as CEO Elon Musk aims to expand ride-hailing in up to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year, with a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles. "We expect to be operating in Nevada and Florida and Arizona by the end of the year," Musk said on an October earnings call. Tesla's robotaxis are operating commercially in San Francisco and Austin. The company is hiring in cities such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, and Orlando, as it ramps up the robotaxi deployment process. On Monday, Tesla received approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate ride-hailing services in the state. It also submitted a "self-certification" to test its robotaxis in the state with safety drivers, a spokesperson for the department told Business Insider. Meanwhile, in California, a robotaxi war is breaking out. Uber, Tesla, and Waymo are fighting to shape robotaxi regulations in the state. Waymo, which operates self-driving taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, said in November that companies offering autonomous ride-hailing services should submit quarterly reports about the rides. Tesla opposed this suggestion. This week, Amazon launched its Zoox robotaxi service in San Francisco, offering select members of the public free rides. Tesla's stock price dropped about 2% on Thursday. It's up more than 15% in the past year. Update: November 21, 2025 — This story has been updated to include a statement from the NTA. Jump to
