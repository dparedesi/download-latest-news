In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Corporate America has touted artificial intelligence as the start of a new era of productivity, but Goldman Sachs' latest report suggests job cuts are already on the horizon. Goldman's analysis is based on a survey of 105 Goldman bankers, who service clients across various industries. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at how major US companies are actually utilizing AI and what that means for their workforces. The survey found that companies are primarily turning to AI to boost productivity and revenue — not to slash costs — with nearly half of banking clients using the technology to drive growth. This compares with just one in five deploying it primarily to cut expenses. Meanwhile, only about one in 10 firms has reduced head count so far due to AI, though nearly a third of bankers covering technology, media, and telecom clients report early signs of job pressure. Still, the bankers expect AI to start trimming payrolls soon. They forecast a 4% reduction in head count over the next year, followed by a deeper 11% cut within three years. "The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and head count reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected," wrote Goldman's analysts, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, in a Thursday note. About 55% of Goldman's bankers expect clients to rely on hiring freezes or natural attrition as AI reshapes roles, while 26% anticipate layoffs or broader restructuring. Goldman's bankers also see the most significant potential for AI-driven reductions in head count in customer support, where 80% of respondents expect cuts as automation takes hold. Other positions at risk include those in administrative support, operations at 49%, and IT and engineering. Goldman's report lands amid a wave of recent layoffs that underscore how quickly workforce reductions are spreading beyond traditional cost-cutting drives. Earlier this week, tech giant Amazon cut 14,000 jobs with CEO Andy Jassy saying the cuts were driven by cultural fit — not cost savings or AI. Still, the timing highlights how technology is reshaping hiring across sectors. "The relatively high current and expected adoption rates for US corporates and meaningful expected head count reductions support our long-standing view that AI is set to have a transformative impact on the labor market and economy," they wrote. Goldman's forecast for job losses reflects the rapid adoption of AI by companies. Goldman's bankers report that 37% of clients are already using AI for regular production — significantly above the Census Bureau's recent survey, which showed a 9.9% adoption rate. They expect the share of overall adoption to rise to 50% next year and 74% within three years, suggesting a rapid acceleration as AI tools become more embedded in day-to-day operations. Yet many companies remain cautious. About 61% of Goldman's bankers said clients view AI as "too early a technology" to deploy widely, and 47% said firms lack the in-house expertise to build the right tools. Jump to

October 31, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA News Summary: GYEONGJU, South Korea, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- APEC Summit—NVIDIA today announced that it is working with SK Group to build an AI factory to advance semiconductor research, development and production, as well as cloud infrastructure to support digital twin and AI agent development. SK Group is building an AI factory featuring more than 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs, with the first phase planned for completion by late 2027. Once complete, the system is expected to be one of Korea’s largest AI factories. The new factory will serve SK subsidiaries — including SK hynix and SK Telecom (SKT) — as well as external organizations through a GPU-as-a-service model, accelerating digital transformation and industrial innovation for Korea’s industries. Further expanding the NVIDIA and SK Group partnership, the companies are collaborating on the development of SK hynix high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and next-generation advanced memory solutions for NVIDIA GPUs, semiconductor manufacturing and telecommunications infrastructure. “In the era of AI, a new kind of manufacturing plant has emerged: the AI factory,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “SK Group is a vital memory technology partner, helping NVIDIA create the world’s most advanced GPU computing platforms that power global AI progress. We are delighted to partner with SK to build its AI foundation on NVIDIA accelerated computing and software, creating AI factories that will transform SK and energize Korea’s AI ecosystem.” “SK Group is working with NVIDIA to make AI the engine of a profound transformation that will enable industries across Korea to transcend traditional limits of scale, speed and precision,” said Chey Tae-Won, chairman of SK Group. “With the NVIDIA AI factory as our foundation, SK Group will forge the infrastructure that powers the next generation of memory, robotics, digital twins and intelligent AI agents.” The SK Group AI factory infrastructure will be available to sovereign model developers participating in the Korea government’s Sovereign AI Foundation Models project. SKT is also taking part in the program as a model developer to provide foundation models for enterprises, industries and researchers working on AI agent and application development. SK Telecom Advances Physical AI and Robotics With NVIDIA OmniverseNVIDIA Cloud Provider SKT plans to build an industrial AI cloud with NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs in Asia, empowering the nation’s manufacturing leaders to advance physical AI and robotics development. The initial deployment will include over 2,000 NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, and will run NVIDIA Omniverse™ workloads to support SK hynix’s semiconductor manufacturing, fab digital twins and internal AI agents. SK Hynix Boosts Productivity Through AI Physics, Digital Twins, Robotics and AI AgentsSK hynix is using the accelerated cloud infrastructure from SKT to scale its operations. SK hynix is tapping NVIDIA CUDA-X™ technologies, including through the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo™ framework, to accelerate chip design with AI physics. This accelerates technology computer-aided design simulations, enabling SK hynix to deliver next-generation semiconductor products faster and with greater precision.

Title: Not AI Or Costs, Amazon CEO Cited This Reason Behind Mass Layoffs

Amazon’s decision to slash 14,000 jobs this week was not about cutting costs or chasing artificial intelligence (AI) trends. Instead, it was a move to realign the company’s culture, according to CEO Andy Jassy. Speaking during the company’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Oct. 30, Jassy commented on the layoffs for the first time. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said, according to a Business Insider report. “It really— it's culture.” Jassy’s remarks reportedly reflect his ongoing effort to reshape Amazon’s internal culture this year, a push focused on raising performance standards, enforcing discipline and cutting through bureaucracy. The job cuts announced on Oct. 28 represent Amazon’s largest round of layoffs since the company shed 27,000 roles in late 2022. During Thursday’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon’s rapid expansion in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers” within the organisation, which in turn slowed down decision-making. He said that with the ongoing AI transformation reshaping industries, agility is more important than ever. “Sometimes, without realising it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy said, according to Business Insider, adding, “And it can lead to slowing you down.” Jassy’s comments highlight a trend spreading across Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft have also been flattening their organisational structures, reducing management layers to accelerate operations and eliminate corporate excess. In the latest round of job cuts on Oct. 28, Amazon reportedly informed some affected employees of their termination through text messages. Many workers received two early-morning texts that day, notifying them their roles had been eliminated. The first message advised staff to check their personal or work email accounts before leaving for the office, while a follow-up text instructed anyone who had not yet received an email about their employment status to contact the helpdesk for assistance. The purpose of these text alerts, sent shortly after the emails, was reportedly to prevent affected employees from facing the awkward situation of arriving at work only to find their building access had been revoked.

Lenskart Solutions Ltd. has raised Rs 3,268 crore from anchor investors on Thursday, ahead of its initial public offering. The company allotted 8.13 crore shares at Rs 402 apiece to 147 anchor investors. However, while 22 participated in the anchor allocation, seven refrained from doing it. The IPO which has become a buzzword in the markets, has allotted shares to 21 mutual fund houses and asset management companies. They applied through 59 schemes and collectively netted 35.34% of the anchor portion. New World Fund got the highest allocation of 3.82%. While T. Rowe Price International Discovery Fund got the second highest allotment of 3.11%, SBI Focused Fund got 3.06% stake in the company. SBI, Kotak, ICICI Prudential, HDFC and Axis were among the major fund houses in this category. While 22 mutual fund houses have acquired stake in Lenskart through anchor allocation, there are seven that did not participate. The mutual fund houses include Parag Parikh, Nippon India and Tata Mutual fud. The IPO anchor book had received bids worth Rs 68,000 crore on Wednesday, which was one day ahead of the public issue's opening for subscription, according to sources. This was nearly 10 times the issue size of about Rs 7,300 crore, and 20 times the anchor book size of nearly Rs 3,200 crore. The anchor book reflects a strong interest from foreign institutional investors, who account for 52% of the bids received. BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, Nomura and Capital International were the leading FIIs participating in the nearly Rs 3,200 crore anchor book. Investors have taken to X their concerns about mutual funds subscribing to the IPO with its soaring valuations.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defends 14,000 job cuts, says ‘not about costs or AI’ — so what's behind it?

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it plans to cut nearly 14,000 corporate jobs, just months after CEO Andy Jassy had warned that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could reduce the company’s workforce. In a surprising twist during Amazon's quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Andy Jassy clarified that the layoffs were not about cost-cutting or the adoption of AI. Instead, he said the affected employees did not align with Amazon's culture. This marked the first time he addressed the layoffs since their announcement. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Andy Jassy said, adding that “it really — it's culture.” Andy Jassy's remarks align with Amazon's broader mission to reshape its culture this year, as chronicled by Business Insider. He has been working to raise the e-commerce giant's performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy across the company. During the earnings call, Jassy explained that Amazon's rapid growth in recent years had led to the creation of “a lot more layers,” which has ultimately slowed down the decision-making process. He stressed the need for the company to “operate leaner and move faster,” especially amid the transformative impact of AI across different industries. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” Jassy added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.” While Jassy focused on cultural and structural factors behind the layoffs, the initial announcement — made by Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, through a blog post on Tuesday — cited a different reason. Galetti explained that the rapid evolution of the world due to AI was the reason behind reducing employee headcount, despite the company's strong performance. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),” Galetti wrote in the blog post. The most recent layoffs at Amazon marked the company's biggest job cut since it let go of 27,000 employees in late 2022, Business Insider reported. The move also points to a wider trend in Big Tech. Companies like Google and Microsoft are embracing what's being called the “Great Flattening” - trimming layers of managers to move faster and reduce corporate bloat. Amazon also disclosed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs, the news report said.

Title: S&P 500’s path to 7,000 boosted by derivative flows
URL: https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/sp-500s-path-to-7000-boosted-by-derivative-flows/bullish-options-fuel-u-s-market-surge/slideshow/124984279.cms
Time Published: 2025-10-31T04:30:25Z
Full Content:
A wave of bullish options trading has turbocharged the U.S. stock market’s rally, propelling the S&P 500 close to the 7,000 mark after gaining 17% so far this year. Traders have shown strong appetite for call options, pushing the one-month rolling calls-to-puts ratio to its most optimistic level in nearly four years. This surge in demand highlights the growing confidence among investors betting on continued market strength. (Source: Reuters) The sharp rise in call-option buying has left options dealers in a “short gamma” position, where they tend to amplify market swings rather than absorb them. In this setup, dealers sell stock futures when markets decline and buy them when prices rise, inadvertently increasing volatility. This dynamic means price moves in either direction are likely to become more pronounced. If the S&P 500 breaks above the key 7,000 level, dealers’ hedging activity could actually accelerate the rally. Since they are short gamma, dealers would be forced to buy stock futures to rebalance their positions as prices rise, adding fresh upward pressure. As Chris Murphy of Susquehanna Financial Group noted, the influx of aggressive upside call buyers has created conditions that could temporarily keep the market’s momentum alive. However, the same mechanics that drive rallies can also deepen declines. If the market starts to weaken, dealers could sell stock futures to hedge, worsening any pullback. Analysts caution that investors may have already priced in too much optimism, leaving little “fuel” for another big leg higher. SpotGamma’s Brent Kochuba believes the market could easily pause or retrace some gains from current levels. Much of the recent enthusiasm has been centred around the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants — Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. But according to Nomura’s Charlie McElligott, this rush into upside calls may have peaked. He expects a short-term pullback of 3% to 5% in major U.S. indexes, citing investor fatigue, rising concerns over AI spending, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate cuts.(Disclaimer: This slideshow has been sourced from Reuters.)

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: AI didn’t break agencies – the talent drain did

Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A senior marketer at a major WPP Media client told me recently they’re thinking about shopping around for a new agency. That, in itself, isn’t surprising, especially after WPP’s new CEO Cindy Rose, publicly admitted the company had “lost its way”. What stood out was why they’re considering the move. It’s not about chasing AI breakthroughs or assembling yet another full-stack planning and buying setup. It’s something more fundamental — and harder to fix: the people. “They’re ultimately what matter to me as a client,” they continued. “If we put the account up for a review, that’s going to be part of our decision. We’re not big enough to get the best payment terms so we have to focus on where we get the best service.” Because while AI and data dominate the holding company narrative, the harder truth is it’s still about the people, specifically the ones talking to clients, translating their needs and hopes into something a machine can use. Without them, there’s no story worth telling and no work worth executing. That’s true for small clients as much as it is for the biggest ones. And it’s the quiet advantage of the best holdcos. Not the grand vision but the execution. It’s why WPP fought so hard to keep Laurent Ezekiel from leaving for Publicis – and taking Coca-Cola’s North American media business with him. It’s also why Jacki Kelley, IPG’s chief client and business officer, has become such a stabilizing force as she guides clients through the uncertainty surrounding Omnicom’s proposed acquisition of the group. “The client owners at the holdcos are very powerful at the moment,” said Rube Schreurs, CEO of media management firm Ebiquity. “They run these big pitches, and they are the ones who coordinate and bring together all these different capabilities across the agency group to benefit the client.” The real power inside holdcos now belongs to the people who run the clients, not the ones running the agencies. Think of them as chief client or business officers. Their work isn’t flashy but its crucial. Take something as basic as managing a client roster. Stack too many high-maintenance accounts that demand constant re-planning, and even the strongest teams start to crack. Balance one or two of those with steadier clients, and things stay sustainable. It’s agency management 101 but it’s harder to pull off when the pressure to chase growth collides with the reality of leaner headcounts. Ultimately, that’s what CMOs buy. Not tools or tech stacks but people who can make the complicated feel simple and the promises real. I was reminded of that in a recent conversation with a consultant who advises two WPP clients. I asked whether either of them was concerned by the holdco’s struggles, and they laughed before saying no. For them, what matters most isn’t the corporate shakeups. It’s the service they get from their account director – the person who knows their business, answers the phone and makes things happen. That person, the consultant said, is far more valuable to them than any data platform or AI capability. Not least because the technology can flatter to deceive. Agencies have laid off hundreds of people in the name of AI, yet the promise of truly autonomous agents still hasn’t materialized. Most of what’s being sold as automation still needs human oversight. And even then, it hasn’t shown it can come close to the kind of ingenuity that made advertising a cultural force in the first place. None of this dismisses the importance of technology. It just means the human layer – the senior talent that keeps clients connected to a complicated, centralized structure – has never mattered more. These are the people who know how to make a holding company work for a client, not against them. When that experience walks out the door, things start to fray: briefs go missing, timelines slip and what was meant to feel seamless turns into red tape. The irony, of course, is that these executives are now in short supply just as their value is becoming obvious. Some have left on their own terms, others were pushed out. Many were the ones who didn’t fit in a model that prized consolidation over chemistry and scale over service. Now, as holdcos try to rewire themselves for the AI era, they’re learning the same old lesson: the people were the strategy all along. The machines are improving but the judgment around them is eroding. That’s what stood out in the World Federation of Advertisers’ latest report: more marketers are reaching a level of maturity where they value agency execs who can move across a holdco’s resources, unshackled by P&L silos or internal questions. When they ask a question, they don’t want spin or salesmanship, they want a clear, honest answer. “These people are unicorns,” said one executive. “They can read the numbers, understand the brief and challenge the model. But they’re the first ones deemed too expensive.” Which is to say: for all the talk about AI transforming agencies, it’s also hollowing them out, leaving fewer people capable of critical judgement inside increasingly automated structures. Agencies save money on executional labor but rarely reinvest it in the translators — the people who can make the technology useful. Ryan Kangisser, chief strategy officer of MediaSense, summed it up in a message he sent me: “AI is of course transforming the future of work for Agencies but agentic without agency (small a!) is a potential recipe for disaster. There are essentially two transformations underway within agencies. First delivering the promise of AI through more effective, more strategic and thoughtful work (at scale). Second, doing this ‘through the line’ and breaking down the silos that are holding clients back from truly customer centric marketing. This was an important theme in our Future of Media Organisation study which revealed how intentionally brands and their media organizations are pivoting from being individual contributors to connectors of the customer journey. For agencies this demands a reset in their talent profile and the curriculum needed to be valuable to today’s marketer.” The ad industry’s plan to define what counts as AI With AI on the rise, industry bodies such as the IAB, MRC and WFA are all taking their own approaches in an attempt to bring some order to the chaos. At the same time, some marketers are already starting to steer their clients away from AI-made “slop” In graphic detail: how AI search is changing brand visibility Digiday has charted the state of AI search for marketers and how brands are (and aren’t) responding. Ad tech’s economy depends on float and it’s getting pricier to keep it moving Typically in ad tech, money moves slower than the ads it sells. But it turns out as time goes on, those late payments are being delayed more and more, and agencies of all sizes aren’t immune to the impacts it has. Meta shares fall on higher expense guidance despite record revenue Meta recorded $51.2 billion in revenue during its Q3 2025 earnings call, equating to a 26% year-over-year growth, but after warning analysts and investors that the amount the company spends on AI is likely to rise “significantly”, Meta’s stock dropped more than 7%, according to WSJ. OpenAI has an AGI problem – and Microsoft just made it worse OpenAI has a new for-profit structure, but its latest deal with Microsoft seems to come with some strings attached, according to The Verge. Nvidia becomes world’s first $5tn company Nvidia has become the world’s first $5 trillion company, according to Financial Times. The company’s stock increased as a result of strong sales of its AI systems, as well as the prospect of access to China, an idea that is expected to be floated by President Donald Trump during his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping. More than 1,500 chief executives have left their posts so far this year through August, up 4% from last year. It’s no secret the company wants advertisers to see its demand-side platform as the backbone for buying across the open web. The holdco hopes its new product can open up SaaS revenue.

Title: The Changing American -- and International -- Buying Culture

There is no question that we in the U.S, have turned a big corner when it comes to how and where we shop. Anyone with a computer or a smartphone can turn it on (that is, if it is ever turned off) and traverse the shelves of millions of companies' merchandise, shopping the world without moving an inch. Contrast that with pre-digital days when families had a Sears, Roebuck or a Montgomery Wards catalogue and thumbed through them, routinely, to see all the marvelous gimcrack that money could buy. To put things in perspective, Montgomery Ward, the company that actually invented the mail-order catalog in 1872, ended publication of its general catalogue in 1985 due to financial difficulties and competition from modern retail formats. Sears ceased publication of its full-line catalogue in 1993. I remember both, fondly. They were "dream books" where all manner of fascinating (and many ordinary) items called out from their silent placement on one of hundreds of pages to ordinary Americans to please consider them for purchase. These books were thought to be in direct competition with local merchants, but few or no local shop owners had the space or financial wherewithall to stock them. Both Sears and Wards opened their stores at roughly the same time (Sears in 1925 and Wards in 1926). Their popularity grew quickly, but both maintained strong original customer bases among rural Americans. For the next fifty years or so, Americans displayed pretty predictable buying habits. Then, in the late eighties, the spread of the computer began to alter those habits. Online merchandisers started appearing, the most prominent of course is the ubiquitous Amazon which made its debut in 1995 (in 1994 it was called "Cadabra"). The shopping paradigm took a massive jolt as the company went from strength to strength during the 1990s. From a startup selling books, music and videos, the company soon changed its business model to that of a multi-sided marketplace platform (MSMP) which now connects sellers (who list and sell products), buyers (who shop through Amazon’s site or app) and third-party service providers (delivery, advertising, developers, etc.). The company actually took the Sears/Wards concept and ratcheted it up and applied it to the modern marketplace thanks to digitalization. Today, Amazon earns money by facilitating transactions between these three sides of itself and taking a cut through commissions, fees, and services. In some ways, Amazon resembles Sears and Wards and all other previous merchants. It buys wholesale and sells retail. Unlike its bricks and mortar predecessors, though, it engages in third-party marketplace sales by using its digital platform to reach customers, and it takes a referral fee (usually 8%–15%) and sometimes fulfillment and storage fees (FBA) from the companies whose products are listed. The company has a Web Services Division (AWS) which is a cloud-based computing division launched in 2006. It provides servers, storage, databases, and AI tools to businesses, globally. (This division is Amazon's most profitable one.) Then there is Amazon's subscription services which include Amazon Prime (membership for free shipping, video streaming, music, etc.) which generates recurring revenue and strengthens customer loyalty. Another revenue stream for Amazon is its sale of ad space on its website and applications. (Sponsored product listings, banner ads, and video ads now make Amazon the third-largest digital ad company after Google and Meta). Amazon and its founder learned much from Sears and Wards. Both older companies offered ancillary services like: insurance, credit and financing, automotive and home services and mail-order repair and service. It is fair to say that both of them were trusted by American consumers. Their guarantees were honored and their service was sterling. Amazon's return policy is seamless and trusted by millions of customers who know that they will be treated fairly by the company if a product doesn't live up to its claims. In pre-Amazon days, local merchants lived and died by their reputations. If customers lost faith in or were treated poorly by local merchants they stopped patronizing them and their businesses failed. Amazon sits on the same slippery slope and knows that its reputation is built one sale and sometimes one return at a time which is why it has adopted policies similar to those of Sears and Wards. There is a reputational value for many companies to have their products listed with Amazon because they know that they will not have to stand at the front line and defend their own individual return policies. Amazon will do it for them, and if Amazon treats its customers well, it reflects positively on manufacturers who don't have to deal with dissatisfied customers if something goes wrong. That is a double-edged sword, however, as Amazon gets all the credit for the successful consummation of the sale and the after-sale experience. In essence, individual companies cede their reputations to Amazon's sales fulfillment policy. Granted that a bad product is still a bad product, and the original manufacturer will still have to defend it, but the whole return experience rests in Amazon's hands. This singular return policy issue is often a deal-breaker or deal-maker for American consumers. Trust is key and so is ease of return. Other online retailers know this and are keenly aware that it is not only the products that compete with each other but sales, return and service policies as well and they can often make the difference between a sale or a miss. Websites went mainstream in the mid-to-late 1990s, but it wasn't until around the new millenium at the beginning of the dot com era that the bulk of retailers discovered the benefits of a web presence. Our buying culture began to change as more and more Americans began to go "online" and dip their toes in the digital retailers' water. Twenty-five years ago there were $25 billion in retail online sales. Today, global retail sales are $6.3 trillion. By comparison, Sears' highest annual sales year was in 2003 with $53 billion. Amazon's net sales in the same year were $5.26 billion. How are American consumers shopping today? If we look at "traditional" non-digital bricks and mortar retail sales in the U.S. today, the figure is estimated to be about $7.26 trillion. U.S. online (digital) retail sales in 2024 are estimated at about $1.19 trillion. While the actual sales figure disparity is huge, there is one very worrisome trend that keeps physical retailers up at night. It is "showrooming." Showrooming is simply a situation where a potential customer will visit a physical store, view an actual product on display, note its price and then take up a salesperson's time with a number of questions, after which they will leave and do an Internet search (probably on Amazon) and make their purchase based on price. Obviously, this disadvantages the physical retailer that has to inventory the product, display the product, educate his workforce on the merits of the product, and then worry that the customer will change his mind after purchasing it and return it at which point the retailer must then incorporate it back into his stock as a "used product" and take a loss on its sale. Meanwhile, Amazon has dedicated online retail marketplaces with websites in about 23 countries. There are eleven in Europe and the U.K. but none in Denmark, for example, to take just one Scandinavian country. One might ask why that is. Apart from the obvious market size (Denmark has only 6 million people) there are other reasons, one of them being the labor issue. Denmark follows what’s called the Danish model, a system based on collective bargaining between unions and employer organizations, rather than strict labor laws set by the state. Around 65%–70% of Danish workers are union members, and unions are deeply involved in setting working conditions, wages, and benefits. Employers operating in Denmark are expected — almost socially and politically required — to recognize and negotiate with unions. Amazon’s stance on unions is one of resistance to unionization. The company prefers direct employee management rather than collective bargaining and has fought union access in many countries (including Germany, the U.S., and the UK). In countries where unions are especially strong — like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden — Amazon’s reluctance to engage with unions has created tension in what can only be described as the "Nordic labor conflict." In 2023 in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union (Transportarbetareförbundet) and Union launched strikes at Amazon’s Swedish logistics partners because Amazon refused to sign a collective agreement. Danish unions, including 3F (Fagligt Fælles Forbund), HK Handel, and others, supported the Swedish strike, refusing to handle Amazon goods from Sweden. This Nordic solidarity action effectively made it impossible for Amazon to operate freely in Denmark without recognizing a union agreement. As of today, Amazon still has no collective bargaining agreement in Scandinavia, though negotiations have been discussed. The practical effect on Denmark is that Amazon has avoided opening warehouses, logistics hubs, or data centers in Denmark as doing so would legally and socially require negotiating with unions. Instead, the company serves Danish customers through Germany, where it can maintain control of operations while still reaching the Danish market. This has given cover to Danish retailers who are still able to avoid in-country Amazon competition and continue to charge high prices for many of the same goods. However, if Danish consumers wish to purchase goods through Amazon's marketplaces in E.U. countries they can avoid paying customs duties or tariffs as the purchases are considered intra-E.U. sales and not international imports. Danish customers will still pay the onerous 25% Value Added Tax on products shipped to Denmark through the EU VAT One Stop Shop (OSS) System. The future for physical retailers is one of adapt or fail as the Internet and AI join forces to find the best deals across many digital platforms and place further pressure on traditional merchants that have avoided changing their business models. This goes for stores in Denmark that must shell out vast sums for store rentals and high wages for employees and for "showroomers" where steadily rising costs challenge their bottom lines.

Bush, Clinton, and G.W. Bush administrations. He is the author of fourteen books, seven of them on American politics, and has written more than 1,500 articles on politics, economics, and social trends.

Title: Meta could get left behind in the AI arms race—and the stock is paying for it

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have his head in the clouds—and that might be the problem. Shares in the Facebook parent are getting crushed Thursday after it unveiled a mixed set of third-quarter earnings last night and doubled down on plans to billions more on artificial intelligence over the coming year. “Our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully," finance chief Susan Li told investors late Wednesday. “We expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. As a result, our current expectation is that Capex dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025." Those remarks overshadowed both a record quarterly revenue tally of $51.2 billion and a $16 billion tax hit that ate into the group’s bottom line. “Meta has always been a company willing to spend its way into the future," said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank. “This quarter confirms that pattern, only now the bet is far larger and the payoff less immediate." Meta’s challenge, however, is that it can’t finance its AI ambitions through cash flows in the way that rivals such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, which have massive commercial cloud computing divisions that generate billions in revenue, are able to do. And that leads to more debt. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Meta is planning to raise $25 billion through a six-part corporate bond offering that will include debt that doesn’t mature until the year 2065. A deal Meta finished last week, aimed at building a new data center in Louisiana, also moved $27 billion in debt from its balance sheet by structuring it through a special-purpose vehicle. Zuckerberg hinted at the idea of selling some of its excess computing power to outside customers if the group “overshoots" on its spending and infrastructure plans. “And then you know, the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation," he said. “But we’d grow into that and use it over time." A lot can change in that waiting period, however, especially given that Meta remains caught in the inherent contradiction of AI itself: If the technology is successful in speeding up tasks and accelerating online efficiencies, users will likely then spend less time on the ad-based platforms such as Facebook and Instagram that drive nearly all of the group’s profits. It’s also worth noting that the Metaverse, Zuckerberg’s last great tech vision that was launched with great fanfare in late 2020, has been something of a dud. Reality Labs, the division created to power that alternative universe, lost $4.4 billion last quarter, taking its cumulative red ink past $70 billion in less than five years. Bank of America analyst Justin Post, however, remains a believer. “We expect Meta stock to be controversial given a limited EPS growth outlook and free cash flow pressure in 2026," he said in a note published Thursday. “However, we see Meta in a position of strength with massive user network and opportunity to integration compelling AI products (including content creation tools) over the next two years." Still, Post lowered his Meta stock price target by $90, taking it to $810 a share, although he kept his Buy rating in place. Meta stock was down 9.6% at 679.73, a move that would mark the biggest single-day since April 2024. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Tokenization is surging as analysts predict significant capital inflows, offering enticing prospects for retail and institutional investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Disclosure: This is a paid article. Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. Learn more › It’s no secret that one of the hottest tickets in crypto right now is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The market grew from $15.7 billion in January to over $35.5 billion today, making gains during the current bull run and consolidating even when other areas of the market looked weak. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that savvy traders are eyeing the market with a view to profit-making opportunities, seeking the best investments as the year closes out. Whether in finance, commodities, or real estate, there are a number of potential RWAs which merit closer scrutiny. Here we take a look at which real-world assets could lead the pack through 2025 and beyond. Tokenization is on a growing adoption curve as analysts predict capital inflows from retail and institutional investors alike. For anyone seeking to ride the crest of this liquidity wave, there are a number of options worthy of further scrutiny. ConstructKoin (CTK) – ConstructKoin is a newcomer to the field already garnering significant coverage in the trades. Currently in pre-sale on Ethereum, ConstructKoin focuses on property development empowering investors to “become the bank” and earn a yield of between 7-15% through ownership of $CTK tokens. ConstructKoin is currently generating buzz thanks to its loan book funding model which is powered by next-level AI and building information management software. Lending decisions are made in hours rather than weeks, promising accelerated property development with rapid growth potential. Gold (XAUt, PAXG, etc.) – It’s been a great year for gold, soaring against fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound and Euro. Gold began the year at just $2,600 per ounce and now rests just shy of $4,000, offering significant upside for anyone with exposure. Thanks to gold’s popularity as an investment commodity, a number of players including Tether (XAUt) and Paxos (PAXG) offer tokenized gold among their portfolio of stablecoins. On October 17, gold prices peaked at an all-time high of over $4,300 before buy momentum eased and charts retraced. The question investors will ask now is whether 2025’s gold rush has finally run out of speed. Ondo Finance (ONDO) – Ondo is one of RWA’s frontrunners, offering tokenized US treasuries and bank demand deposits. From its launch in 2024 to today ONDO has made significant progress, rising from a price of just $0.16 to $0.69. CoinCodex shows the ONDO token is up 330% from inception and now boasts a market capitalization of over $2B. In March of this year ONDO moved $95 million into BlackRock’s tokenized asset fund BUIDL signaling greater institutional involvement in the tokenization sphere, and further bolstering proponents’ claims Ondo is ‘the Blackrock of crypto.’ From the start of 2025 the total volume locked (TVL) in Ondo Finance rose from $612 million to $1.78 billion, suggesting strong fundamentals and sustained interest. While market predictions are a tricky business, global consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group predicts the RWA market will touch $16 trillion by 2030. Expectations vary however. More conservative projections by McKinsey and Citi Group predict the market will reach $4 trillion, while Standard Chartered projects the market will soar to $30 trillion over the same period. Though analysts may quibble on the exact numbers, all agree the upward momentum of the sector is parabolic. The forecasts for tokenization look strong but for investors speculating on which asset class will perform best through the remainder of 2025, a number of key factors will come into play. Gold has performed extremely well this year, boosted by the ongoing US-China trade war, but may already have peaked. Although gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, this only applies in periods of highest uncertainty. Unless there are major surprises in store for global trade relations, the best days for goldbugs may already have passed. In the medium term, Ondo Finance looks strong. Key partnerships with TradFi’s heavy hitters such as BlackRock place Ondo on a strong footing, and its growing TVL suggest ONDO token may be underpriced. ConstructKoin ($CTK) stands out as a project offering double-digit yields and exposure to the real estate sector. Its design connects digital assets with a traditionally stable market, making it one to watch closely as the project develops through 2025 and beyond. Disclaimer: This was a sponsored (paid) post.

Title: Sega Forever creator confirms departure from Sega after seven years
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sega-Forever-creator-confirms-departure-from-Sega-after-seven-years.1151569.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-31T02:47:00Z

Former Senior Global Community Manager for Sega of America, Danny Russell, who spearheaded the Sega Forever initiative, confirmed that he’s left the company after more than seven years via a LinkedIn post. In the post, he announced, “After some time away from socials for personal reasons, I’m ready to share that last year I moved on from Sega, closing an incredible chapter of my career.” Russell mentioned his proudest achievements in the post, including launching and running Sega Forever from scratch. The initiative was launched in 2017 by Sega as a move to re-release retro classics on iOS and Android. The Sega Forever project evolved beyond a retro-emulation service and gradually shifted into a game preservation effort, featuring retrospectives and unearthing and preserving rare assets in a digital archive. Sega Forever’s social media handle on X became the voice for retro enthusiasts worldwide, posting almost daily until it finally went silent by the end of August 2023, with the final post celebrating the recovery and restoration of the SEGAWORLD London Sonic statue at Gamescom. Many speculate that the abrupt silence was due to layoffs at Sega. In September 2023, Russell deleted a post that suggested some internal struggles. In the post, Russell stated: What should you do when you’ve been bullied all year and no one is helping, five months after raising a grievance. I have been off ill in recent weeks, adapting to medication due to the stress of this past year, and this bully has used this time to take even more away from me. Sega briefly teased a revival of the Sega Forever project back in January 2025 with a rebranded X account, but it has not led to anything new since. By June 2025, Sega delisted many of its classic titles from Android and iOS storefronts. However, players who downloaded the now-removed titles can still play them offline. Russell concluded the post, stating: I am deeply grateful to fans, collaborators, content creators, and partners I worked with along the way. Your creativity and passion made every project special. I am especially excited to have seen Shinobi return and remain hopeful that other legacy IPs that I supported behind the scenes (Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Virtua Fighter) get the spotlight they deserve. I wish my friends at Sega all the best for the future. Buy Sega Genesis Classics on Amazon Danny Russell – LinkedIn, Mirror post on X

ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Earnings week for the Mag 7 brought mixed results and sharp stock moves. Apple rose more than 3 percent after reporting $102.47 billion revenue and $1.85 EPS, driven by iPhone and Services. Alphabet logged its first $100 billion quarter, up 16 percent year over year, on strong search and cloud performance. Microsoft posted $77.7 billion revenue and $3.72 EPS but fell on concerns about AI infrastructure spending. Meta set a record $51.24 billion revenue, then dropped 10 percent after a $15.9 billion tax charge and rising Reality Labs capex. Oracle stayed elevated as cloud sales climbed 28 percent in September. Nvidia reached a $5 trillion valuation on relentless AI chip demand, announced seven U.S. supercomputers, invested $1 billion in Nokia, and confirmed plans for up to $100 billion in OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang forecast $500 billion in AI chip sales as investors treated Nvidia as the core of global AI infrastructure. Shares rose 5.6% to $212.19 after reports that President Trump will discuss Nvidia’s Blackwell chips with China’s Xi Jinping. CEO Jensen Huang projected $500 billion in AI chip sales and announced seven new U.S. supercomputers. Nvidia also invested $1 billion in Nokia to develop AI-native 5G and 6G networks. Its stock is up 50% this year. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, cementing its dominance as AI infrastructure demand outpaces supply. Sesame, the smart-glasses startup led by former Oculus co-founders Brendan Iribe and Nate Mitchell, raised $250 million in Series B funding. Sequoia Capital and Spark Capital led the round bringing total funding to about $300 million. The company is developing lightweight AI-powered glasses equipped with voice assistants named Miles and Maya to create an “ambient interface” that understands context and environment. Sesame’s blend of spatial computing and conversational AI positions it as a competitor to Apple, Meta, and Google-backed Magic Leap in the race to define the next generation of AI wearables. For Iribe, who previously founded Scaleform (acquired by Autodesk) and co-founded Oculus (acquired by Facebook for $2 billion), Sesame marks his fourth major venture. White-collar layoffs are accelerating as AI adoption reshapes office work. Last week we reported Amazon is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. This is the tip of the AI iceberg looming before the labor market. UPS has trimmed 14,000 managers over two years, and Target plans 1,800 more cuts. JPMorgan, Walmart, Accenture and others have revealed plans to slow hiring. All cited AI. PwC, the accounting and consulting giant, cut staff globally, partly because of AI. Nestlé cut jobs, blaming automation.GM to Booz Allen are reducing staff, citing efficiency and automation. Nearly two million Americans have been unemployed for six months or longer, while demand for trade, healthcare, and construction workers rises. Recruiters report middle-aged professionals struggling to keep up with new technologies and entry-level hiring tightening. Economists warn that AI-driven restructuring is eroding white-collar stability even as overall productivity improves.The irony is that the companies downsizing will yield huge dividends from Wall Street, which as far as I can tell, has never met a reorg it does not like (remember Meta’s “year of efficiency”?) OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced plans to create an autonomous “AI researcher” by 2028, with an intern-level assistant expected by 2026. The company is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing large-scale investment while its nonprofit foundation retains 26% ownership. Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki said models could surpass human intelligence within a decade through greater “test time compute” and algorithmic advances. OpenAI plans to dedicate entire data centers to major research problems, investing $1.4 trillion to build 30 gigawatts of infrastructure. The foundation will allocate $25 billion for disease research and oversee safety and governance. Magic Leap and Google have partnered to build reference hardware for the Android XR ecosystem. At the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, they revealed a prototype that merges Magic Leap’s waveguide optics with Google’s Raxium microLED engine, a key technology for lightweight AR glasses. The three-year deal positions Magic Leap as an optics and display supplier rather than a consumer brand, with Google focusing on the software layer. The prototype underscores Google’s return to spatial computing and its strategy to seed Android-based AR hardware through partners instead of producing its own glasses. VRChat has launched on Android and iOS, opening the social VR platform to millions of mobile users. The iOS app supports devices running iOS 17 or newer, while Android requires version 10 and at least 6 GB RAM. Phones with less memory can use a limited “Companion” mode. The mobile rollout ends the platform’s beta phase and extends its reach beyond PC and VR headsets, potentially driving major user growth. VRChat recently hit 54,000 concurrent users on PC, its highest count in years, and expects a significant surge as mobile players join its creator-driven virtual worlds. Meta Horizon is approaching mobile XR the same way. Rec Room tried this, but all it did was add users and UGC spam, not revenue, and was partially responsible for layoffs there. This column has a companion, The AI/XR Podcast, hosted by its author, Charlie Fink, and Ted Schilowitz, former studio executive and futurist for Paramount and Fox, and Rony Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. This week’s guest is Kirin Sinha, founder and CEO, Illumix. We can be found on Spotify, iTunes, and YouTube.

Title: Amazon CEO Now Says AI Is Not Responsible for Recent Layoffs
URL: https://gizmodo.com/amazon-ceo-now-says-ai-is-not-responsible-for-recent-layoffs-2000679893

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes Amazon just posted its third-quarter earnings and it turns out it was a phenomenal quarter for the e-commerce giant, despite recent layoffs. The company giant raked in $180.2 billion in sales in the three months ending Sept. 30, up 13% from the same period last year. Its cloud business, AWS, reported its largest year-over-year growth since 2022, climbing 20% to $33 billion. The company’s stock even popped 13% in after-hours trading following the report. So why, with the company performing so well, did Amazon just slash 14,000 corporate jobs and hinted that more cuts could be on the way? Fortunately for us, CEO Andy Jassy was asked to comment on the layoffs during the company’s earnings call Thursday evening. However, he was quick to downplay any connection to AI. âWhat I would tell you is, you know, the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now at least,â Jassy told investors. âIt’s culture.â He went on to try to make the case that the companyâs rapid growth over the last several years added more people, layers, and complexity to its operations. This quick growth, in turn, slowed decision-making and weakened ownership for workers at the frontlines. Jassy said Amazon is now committed to operating like the world’s largest startup in order to move more quickly during what he called the major “technology transformation happening right now.â The memo sent to laid-off employees earlier this week hit a lot of the same points Jassy made. But it also directly named the big tech shift, AI, that he had been hinting at, even as he claimed it wasnât driving this round of layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology weâve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). Weâre convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,â wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, in the memo. Still, these job cuts also come as Amazon, and the rest of Silicon Valley, is seemingly betting it all on AI. Jassy said on Thursday that the companyâs AI and cloud infrastructure added more than 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity in the past 12 months and is expected to add another gigawatt this fourth quarter. And future cuts may not be limited to corporate workers. The New York Times reported last week that Amazonâs automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. Overall, Amazonâs robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the companyâs operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

Financial time series prediction has consistently been one of the core research problems in the fields of econometrics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence1. Since the introduction of Brownian motion theory and the efficient market hypothesis in the mid-20th century2,3, scholars have been exploring how to accurately predict the price movements of financial assets. With the increasing complexity of global financial markets, accurate financial forecasting can not only provide scientific basis for investment decisions but also help financial institutions conduct effective risk management and asset allocation, and its importance is increasingly prominent. The complexity of today’s financial markets far exceeds the assumptions of traditional theoretical models. The exponential growth in information dissemination speed has changed the fundamental operating mechanisms of markets, and diversified information sources such as social media, news websites, and financial blogs enable market information to spread at unprecedented speeds, significantly shortening investors’ decision-making windows, making market reactions more rapid and prone to overreaction. The proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has fundamentally changed market microstructure4,5. According to statistics, algorithmic trading accounts for over 70% of trading volume in the U.S. stock market, and the interaction of these automated trading systems creates complex feedback mechanisms that traditional market models based on human behavior struggle to accurately describe. The deepening of globalization has further increased the complexity of financial markets6, with the correlation between different markets significantly increased, and volatility in a single market often rapidly transmitting to other global markets through various channels such as trade connections, capital flows, and investor sentiment. In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved significant progress in the field of time series prediction, with models such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)7, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)8, and Transformers9 demonstrating strong performance across multiple time series forecasting tasks10,11. However, existing methods primarily focus on the statistical properties of time series data itself, often overlooking two key factors that influence financial markets: first, external event information that drives market behavior (such as corporate announcements, macroeconomic events, and market sentiment)12,13, and second, the complex correlations between assets based on multi-dimensional relationships (such as industry relationships, supply chain relationships, competitive relationships, etc.)14,15. This single-perspective modeling approach limits the predictive accuracy and generalization capability of models in complex financial environments. Although existing research has attempted to address the aforementioned problems, there remain obvious research gaps and technical deficiencies. First, traditional time series models cannot distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but existing models often treat them as identical patterns, leading to limited prediction accuracy17. Consider scenarios of sharp stock price declines where surface price behaviors might be completely identical (such as an 8% single-day drop), but the underlying driving factors are entirely different: earnings-driven declines usually accompanied by high trading volume and strong continuation after earnings announcements18,19; systematic risk declines affect entire sectors or even the entire market; technical adjustment declines usually have small trading volume and easily gain support at key technical levels20,21,22. Existing models often treat these essentially different decline patterns as the same “decline signal,” significantly reducing the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, existing multimodal fusion methods mostly adopt simple feature concatenation or early fusion strategies, lacking deep modeling of complex interactive relationships between event information and time series data23,24. These methods often directly concatenate different types of feature vectors, ignoring the intrinsic logical relationships between different modal information, and event information and price data differ in temporal granularity and impact duration, making simple alignment methods prone to information loss. Finally, in terms of asset relationship modeling, most methods only consider single-dimensional relationships (such as price correlations or industry classifications), failing to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional, multi-level complex correlations among financial assets25. The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional, multi-level complex networks, but existing methods show obvious simplification tendencies in relationship modeling: most studies only consider price correlation as one dimension, ignoring other important dimensions such as fundamental similarity, business relevance, and supply chain relationships; many models assume that relationships between assets remain static, unable to adapt to relationship evolution caused by changing market environments26; in the few studies that consider multi-dimensional relationships, they often simply assign equal weights to various dimensions, lacking adaptive weight adjustment mechanisms. Beyond theoretical challenges, the development of actual financial business also places higher requirements on prediction models. Modern quantitative investment strategies require models not only to predict direction but also to predict magnitude and duration27, and investors want to understand the logic behind prediction results, especially when facing abnormal market conditions28. The 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic shock demonstrated that traditional risk models based on historical data often fail when facing extreme events29, and financial institutions urgently need prediction tools that can integrate multi-source information and identify systemic risks in advance30. With the strengthening of fintech regulation, applications such as algorithmic trading and robo-advisors must possess certain interpretability31, and model decision-making processes need to be reasonably explained to regulatory agencies and customers. Based on these challenges, this study aims to address the following three key questions: How to effectively fuse event information with time series data, enabling models to understand the intrinsic meaning of price patterns under different event contexts; How to construct multi-dimensional asset relationship networks to more comprehensively capture complex correlations in financial markets; How to design effective fusion mechanisms to achieve deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors.” To address the above problems, this paper proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), which achieves deep understanding and accurate prediction of financial time series data through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module. The core innovations of DAFF-Net include: Event-aware routing mechanism: Designed an event-aware router that fuses time series data with contextual event information encoded from news, corporate announcements, and macroeconomic data, enabling the model to understand the underlying narratives behind market fluctuations and effectively distinguish market behavior patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different. Multi-dimensional relationship adaptive fusion: Proposed a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module that constructs a comprehensive asset relationship network more effective than single-relationship methods through adaptive fusion of frequency domain, fundamental, and knowledge graph relationships, capable of dynamically adjusting the importance of different relationship dimensions according to market conditions. Soft clustering attention mechanism: Adopted soft clustering strategies to replace traditional hard clustering methods, preserving fine-grained weak relationship information and avoiding information loss that hard clustering might cause, which is particularly important in complex financial market environments. Dual-stream fusion architecture: Designed an innovative dual-stream fusion framework that achieves deep integration of event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” maximizing the synergistic effects of different modal information through carefully designed masked attention mechanisms. The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a detailed introduction to the overall architectural design of DAFF-Net, including the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, and contextual factor fusion with multi-horizon prediction mechanism; Section 3 presents comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data, including dataset construction, baseline model comparisons, and result analysis; Section 4 provides in-depth discussion of the effectiveness of technical innovations, deep interpretation of model performance, and research limitations with future prospects; Section 5 summarizes the main contributions and practical application value of this research. DAFF-Net adopts a dual-stream fusion design philosophy, with its overall architecture shown in Fig. 1. The core idea of this architecture is to decompose the financial time series prediction task into two complementary learning processes: event-driven temporal pattern understanding and multi-dimensional relationship-aware cross-asset information fusion. As shown in the central part of Fig. 1, DAFF-Net receives three types of heterogeneous data inputs. Let the time series data be \(X \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times T \times D}\), where N represents the number of assets, T represents the time window length, and D represents the feature dimension. Event data is represented as \(E \in {\mathbb {R}}^{T \times D_e}\), where \(D_e\) is the event vector dimension. Relationship data includes fundamental information \(F \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_f}\) and knowledge graph structure \(G \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\). After instance normalization processing, the data streams are respectively fed into two parallel feature extraction branches: Left branch (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1) is the event-driven temporal pattern extractor, which fuses temporal segments with event vectors through an event-aware router: where \({\textbf{h}}_{t} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e)}\) represents the fused representation at time t. Right branch (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1) is the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, which generates three types of relationship matrices in parallel. The frequency-domain relationship matrix is computed through fast Fourier transform: The fundamental relationship matrix computes similarity based on structured data: The knowledge graph relationship matrix is directly obtained from the graph structure: These three relationship matrices are integrated through an adaptive fusion module. As shown in the bottom right corner of Fig. 1, fusion weights are learned through a small neural network: The final fused relationship matrix is: where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication. As shown in the contextual factor fusion module in the center of Fig. 1, the outputs of the two branches are integrated through a masked attention mechanism. The event-aware temporal features \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) output from the left branch and the channel attention matrix \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) output from the right branch are fused as: This fused representation is then passed to the multi-horizon prediction heads, as shown at the top of Fig. 1. The prediction heads consist of multiple feedforward networks that generate predictions for different time spans: where \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\) represents the prediction days, and \({\hat{Y}}_{h} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times 1}\) is the corresponding return prediction. Figure 1 clearly shows the information flow of the entire architecture: multimodal inputs at the bottom undergo feature extraction and relationship modeling through two specially designed branches, then achieve deep integration of “narrative factors” and “relationship factors” in the fusion module, and finally output prediction results for different time spans through multi-horizon prediction heads. This design enables DAFF-Net to simultaneously capture event-driven dynamics and complex inter-asset correlations in financial markets, achieving more accurate multi-horizon predictions. Overall architecture diagram of DAFF-Net. Traditional time series models in financial markets often face the “pattern confusion” problem, i.e., inability to distinguish similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes. For example, the same price decline may stem from poor corporate earnings reports, overall market corrections, or sudden negative events, but traditional models often treat them as identical patterns. To address this key problem, we designed an event-driven temporal pattern extractor, whose architecture is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core of this module is the Event-Aware Router, which addresses the critical challenges of multi-source event integration and temporal alignment. Unlike simple concatenation approaches, our router employs a sophisticated event processing pipeline that handles heterogeneous event types with different temporal granularities and impact characteristics. Multi-Source Event Processing We employ BERT-base-uncased32 pre-trained transformer model for encoding textual event information into 768-dimensional dense representations. The BERT model processes concatenated news headlines and lead paragraphs, with maximum sequence length of 512 tokens. We first categorize events into three distinct types based on their market impact patterns and temporal characteristics: where: \(w_{news}, w_{corp}, w_{macro}\) are learnable event type weights \(\text {decay}(t - t_{news})\) models the temporal decay of news impact: \(\exp (-\lambda (t - t_{news}))\) \(\text {impact}(\text {type}_{corp})\) assigns different weights based on announcement types (earnings: 1.0, guidance: 0.8, strategic: 0.6, operational: 0.4) \(\text {persistence}(\text {policy}_{macro})\) captures the lasting effect of macroeconomic policies Temporal Alignment and Weighting To handle the temporal misalignment between high-frequency trading data and irregular event occurrences, we employ an attention-based temporal alignment mechanism: where \(Q_t\) represents the query vector from time series data at time t, \(K_e\) represents the key vector from event e, and \(\text {temporal}\_\text {mask}(t, t_e)\) applies exponential decay based on the time distance between the trading timestamp and event timestamp. Adaptive Event Fusion The final event representation integrates all event types through learned attention weights: where \(\alpha _i\) are dynamically computed attention weights based on current market volatility and \(\text {EventMemory}_{t-1}\) maintains a momentum term from previous significant events. Final Router Input The temporal segment and processed event vector are then fused: Traditional approaches often rely on generic knowledge bases without proper domain adaptation. Our method addresses this limitation through a systematic financial-domain knowledge graph construction process: Financial Entity Mapping We establish explicit mappings from generic knowledge entities to financial assets through: Relationship Strength Quantification Rather than using arbitrary fixed weights, we derive relationship strengths through empirical analysis of market co-movements and fundamental connections: where \(\rho _{*}\) are empirically derived scaling factors based on historical correlation analysis: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph relationships are updated quarterly based on: Corporate action announcements (M&A, partnerships, spin-offs) Supply chain relationship changes (supplier/customer updates) Regulatory classification changes (GICS sector reclassifications) Cross-holdings and institutional ownership changes This enhanced event-aware routing mechanism ensures that: Different event types are processed according to their inherent characteristics Temporal misalignments are properly handled through attention mechanisms Event impacts are modeled with realistic decay patterns Knowledge graph relationships reflect actual financial market structures Relationship weights are empirically grounded rather than arbitrary The router matches current market conditions to a set of learnable temporal pattern prototypes \(\{P_1, P_2,\ldots , P_M\}\), where each prototype \(P_i \in {\mathbb {R}}^{D_p}\) represents a specific event-driven market behavior pattern. These prototypes are automatically learned through the training process, with typical patterns including (Table 1): Routing probabilities are computed through attention mechanism: where \(W_r \in {\mathbb {R}}^{(D+D_e) \times D_p}\) is a learnable projection matrix. Based on routing probabilities, the system selects Top-K most relevant Linear-based Pattern Extractors (LPEs). Each extractor \(\text {LPE}_i\) is an expert network specifically designed for particular patterns: The final output is obtained through weighted aggregation: Event-Driven Temporal Pattern Extraction The correlations between financial assets are multi-dimensional and dynamically changing, making it difficult for single relationship modeling methods to comprehensively capture this complexity. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, our proposed multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module addresses this problem by generating and fusing three types of relationship views in parallel. To ensure experimental validity and prevent any form of future information leakage, all relationship matrices and model components strictly adhere to temporal constraints. For any prediction at time t, we guarantee that: Frequency-domain relationships are computed using only historical price data from the sliding window \([t-L_{\text {freq}}, t-1]\), where \(L_{\text {freq}} = 60\) trading days: Fundamental relationships utilize only the most recent quarterly financial data available before time t, ensuring no forward-looking bias: Knowledge graph relationships reflect the corporate structure and business relationships as documented up to time \(t-1\), with quarterly updates based on publicly disclosed information: Adaptive fusion weights \(\varvec{\alpha }\) are learned exclusively on the training dataset (2010–2020) and remain frozen during validation (2021–2022) and testing (2023–2025) phases: This temporal discipline ensures that our experimental results reflect genuine predictive capability rather than information leakage artifacts. We verified compliance by re-computing all performance metrics with strict temporal validation protocols. Frequency-domain relationship matrix: Captures periodic similarities in price movements through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT): where \({\tilde{X}}_i^H\) denotes the complex conjugate transpose. Fundamental relationship matrix: Computes cosine similarity based on normalized fundamental data: where fundamental features include (Table 2): Knowledge graph relationship matrix: Quantifies structured relationships between entities by processing financial knowledge graphs. We conducted extensive parameter experiments to determine optimal relationship weights, as shown in Table 3. Based on comprehensive parameter experiments across multiple validation periods, the optimal knowledge graph relationship matrix is defined as: The parameter selection was validated through cross-validation on the training set (2010-2020) and confirmed on the validation set (2021-2022), ensuring robust performance across different market conditions (Table 4). The three relationship matrices are dynamically integrated through an adaptive fusion module. Fusion weights are learned through a multilayer perceptron that takes the current market state as input: The fused relationship matrix is: To achieve more robust “soft” clustering, we apply the Softmax function to each row of the fused matrix to generate a channel attention matrix: The advantage of this soft clustering method over hard clustering is that it preserves subtle weak relationship information, which is particularly important in financial markets. Multi-Dimensional Relation-Aware Soft Clustering The contextual factor fusion module is a key component of the DAFF-Net architecture, responsible for deep integration of heterogeneous information from the two branches. As shown in the fusion module at the center of Fig. 1, this module employs a masked attention mechanism: where \(Z_{\text {temporal}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times D_h}\) is the temporal features from the event-driven branch, and \(A_{\text {channel}} \in {\mathbb {R}}^{N \times N}\) is the channel attention matrix from the relationship-aware branch. To enhance feature representation capability, we further introduce residual connections and layer normalization: The final fused representation is obtained through another feedforward network: The multi-horizon prediction heads adopt a design with shared bottom-layer features and independent prediction branches. For each prediction horizon \(h \in \{1, 5, 20\}\), we design independent prediction networks: where the parameters of each prediction head are independently optimized to adapt to the prediction characteristics of different time spans (Table 5). To simultaneously optimize prediction performance across multiple horizons, we adopt a weighted multi-task loss function: where the loss for each horizon is mean squared error: The weights \(\lambda _h\) are set according to prediction difficulty and practical application importance: \(\lambda _1 = 0.5\), \(\lambda _5 = 0.3\), \(\lambda _{20} = 0.2\). Contextual Factor Fusion and Multi-Horizon Prediction This design enables DAFF-Net to effectively integrate event-driven “narrative factors” and relationship-aware “structural factors,” while providing targeted optimization for prediction tasks across different time spans, thereby achieving excellent performance in multi-horizon financial prediction tasks. This study selects Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock as the primary research subject, based on several important considerations: First, as a global leading technology giant, Amazon’s stock price is subject to complex influences from multiple factors, including changes in company fundamentals, industry technological developments, macroeconomic policies, and market sentiment fluctuations, providing an ideal testing environment for validating our multimodal fusion method; Second, Amazon enjoys extremely high attention in capital markets, with abundant news reports, analyst research reports, and investor discussions, providing sufficient raw materials for constructing high-quality event datasets; Finally, as an important constituent stock of the NASDAQ market, Amazon has complex correlations with other technology stocks, consumer stocks, etc., helping to validate the effectiveness of our multi-dimensional relationship-aware module. We constructed a comprehensive multimodal dataset spanning from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025, totaling over 15 years of complete market data. This time span covers multiple important market cycles, including the technology stock recovery period of 2010-2015, the technology stock boom period of 2016-2020, the pandemic shock and recovery period of 2020-2022, and the interest rate hike cycle and artificial intelligence boom period of 2023-2025, ensuring the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization capability of the model. Data sources cover multiple authoritative financial data providers: quantitative trading data is mainly obtained from Yahoo Finance API and Refinitiv Eikon terminals, including daily open, high, low, close prices, volume, and adjusted prices; news and announcement data is collected in real-time through Bloomberg Terminal News Feed, supplemented by relevant reports from mainstream financial media such as Reuters and Wall Street Journal; fundamental data is extracted from Refinitiv and S&P Capital IQ databases, covering financial statements, valuation indicators, and industry classification information. While Amazon (AMZN) serves as our primary prediction target, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module requires a comprehensive asset universe to construct meaningful N\(\times\)N relationship matrices. We carefully selected a universe of 50 large-cap technology and related stocks to ensure robust relationship modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. Asset Selection Criteria: Market capitalization > $50 billion as of December 2020 Primary listing on NASDAQ or NYSE Technology, consumer discretionary, or communication services sectors (GICS classification) Complete daily trading data availability from 2010–2025 Minimum average daily trading volume > 1 million shares Final Asset Universe (N=50): Core Technology: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NFLX, NVDA, ORCL, CRM, ADBE, INTC, AMD, CSCO, AVGO, QCOM, TXN E-commerce & Consumer: AMZN, EBAY, SHOP, ETSY, WMT, TGT, COST, HD, NKE Cloud & Software: SNOW, PLTR, ZM, WORK, DDOG, NET, OKTA, MDB, CRWD Communication: VZ, T, TMUS, CHTR, CMCSA, DIS, NFLX Related Technology: TSLA, UBER, LYFT, SQ, PYPL, V, MA Temporal Data Handling: All 50 assets follow identical temporal splits: Training period: 2010–2020 (all assets) Validation period: 2021–2022 (all assets) Testing period: 2023–2025 (all assets) Missing data: Forward-fill for gaps \(\le\) 3 days, exclude assets with >5% missing data in any period Delisting handling: Assets delisted during study period are excluded from the relationship matrices after delisting date Relationship Matrix Computation: For frequency-domain and fundamental relationships, we compute pairwise similarities across all 50 assets, resulting in symmetric 50\(\times\)50 matrices. For knowledge graph relationships, we manually verified and annotated business relationships among these 50 entities using SEC 10-K filings, partnership announcements, and industry databases. The Amazon prediction task extracts the relevant row/column from these matrices corresponding to AMZN’s relationships with the other 49 assets. This design ensures that AMZN’s relationship modeling benefits from a rich, diverse set of comparable assets while maintaining strict temporal discipline across the entire universe. Knowledge Graph Construction and Domain Mapping Knowledge graph data construction involves a systematic process of mapping general knowledge bases to financial domain entities. We established comprehensive mappings through the following multi-step procedure: Step 1: Entity Identification and Mapping We constructed a mapping table linking general knowledge entities to financial assets through multiple identification mechanisms: Primary Mapping: Direct ticker symbol matching (e.g., DBpedia:Amazon.com \(\rightarrow\) NASDAQ:AMZN) Secondary Mapping: Company name disambiguation using ISIN codes and official registrations Tertiary Mapping: Cross-reference validation through multiple knowledge bases (DBpedia, Wikidata, OpenCorporates) Step 2: Relationship Extraction and Validation From the mapped entities, we extract structured relationships using SPARQL queries and natural language processing: Direct Business Relations: Partnership agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances extracted from SEC filings and corporate announcements Ownership Structures: Parent-subsidiary relationships from corporate registrations and 10-K filings Supply Chain Networks: Customer-supplier relationships from business dependency disclosures Industry Classifications: GICS sector mappings validated against multiple classification systems (SIC, NAICS, ICB) Step 3: Relationship Strength Quantification We quantify relationship strengths through empirical analysis of historical market co-movements and fundamental connections, as detailed in Table 6. Step 4: Dynamic Relationship Updates The knowledge graph undergoes quarterly updates to reflect corporate actions and market structure changes: Corporate Actions: M&A announcements, spin-offs, and restructuring events Partnership Changes: New strategic alliances and partnership dissolutions Supply Chain Evolution: Customer/supplier relationship updates from annual reports Regulatory Reclassifications: GICS sector changes and industry standard updates This systematic approach ensures that our knowledge graph accurately reflects the evolving landscape of financial market relationships while maintaining high data quality and validation standards. The mapping process achieved 96.1% validation rate across all entity types, providing a robust foundation for relationship-aware modeling. To comprehensively understand the market behavior characteristics of Amazon stock and provide a basis for model design, we first conducted a detailed analysis of the price time series. Amazon stock price time series (2010-2025). As shown in Fig. 2, Amazon stock exhibited typical growth stock characteristics during the study period, with an overall price trend showing strong upward momentum. Several important phase characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 2: During 2010-2012, stock prices fluctuated at relatively low levels, with the price range mainly between \(\$5-25\), reflecting the company’s early market positioning and investor expectations; During 2013-2017, stock prices began to rise significantly, climbing from about \(\$25\) to nearly \(\$100\), corresponding to the rapid development of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and global expansion of e-commerce business; During 2018-2021, stock prices experienced more dramatic volatility, reaching a high of about \(\$180\) during the 2020 pandemic, followed by a significant pullback in 2022 with lows around \(\$80\), reflecting market reassessment of technology stock valuations; Since 2023, stock prices have rebounded strongly again, creating new highs in 2024 exceeding \(\$240\), mainly benefiting from artificial intelligence technology breakthroughs and optimistic market expectations for AI application prospects. To further understand market participation and liquidity characteristics, we analyzed the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, which is important for assessing the credibility of price fluctuations and market depth. Amazon stock trading volume time series (2010-2025). Figure 3 shows the trading volume change patterns during the corresponding period, providing important supplementary information for understanding market participation and price volatility. Several significant characteristics can be observed from the trading volume data in Fig. 3: First, trading volume typically shows significant amplification during major events, particularly during the initial outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020 and the market adjustment period in the second half of 2022, with daily trading volumes often exceeding 600–800 million shares, far above the normal level of 200–400 million shares; Second, the seasonal patterns of trading volume are relatively stable, usually increasing during earnings report seasons (January, April, July, October each year) and year-end/year-beginning periods; Finally, overall trading volume levels have increased in recent years with the proliferation of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, reflecting the evolution of market microstructure. Considering the important role of technical analysis in financial prediction, we need to examine price performance relative to key technical indicators to identify important trend signals and support/resistance levels, which will provide valuable learning targets for our temporal pattern extractor. Amazon stock price vs. moving averages comparison. Figure 4 further demonstrates the relationship between price and technical indicators. By comparing closing prices with 50-day and 200-day moving averages, we can identify important trend reversal points and technical signals. Fig. 4 clearly shows several important technical breakthroughs: the upward breakthrough of 50-day and 200-day moving averages in early 2013, marking the establishment of a long-term uptrend; two technical adjustments in late 2018 and early 2022, where stock prices fell below short-term moving averages but ultimately received support from long-term trend lines; the strong breakthrough in the second half of 2023, where stock prices regained footing above all major moving averages. These technical characteristics provide rich learning samples for our temporal pattern extractor. Finally, to understand the statistical distribution characteristics of returns and validate the necessity of extreme event handling in our model design, we analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of daily returns. Amazon stock daily returns distribution histogram. The daily returns distribution histogram in Fig. 5 reveals the statistical characteristics of Amazon stock returns, showing typical “fat-tailed” distribution characteristics of financial time series. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the distribution center is close to zero, consistent with efficient market hypothesis expectations, but compared to standard normal distribution, this distribution shows obvious excess kurtosis and thicker tails. Specifically, about 68% of daily returns are concentrated in the −2% to +2% range, about 95% of observations are between −6% to +6%, but there are still considerable extreme values exceeding the expected range of normal distribution. This distribution characteristic indicates that financial markets have relatively frequent extreme events, validating the necessity of considering event-driven factors in our model design. To ensure experimental rigor and result reliability, we adopted a strict time series data partitioning strategy to avoid any form of future information leakage. The specific partitioning scheme is: the training set covers January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, totaling 11 years of historical data, providing sufficient learning samples for the model; the validation set is set from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, totaling 2 years of data, used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection; the test set includes January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2025, approximately 2.5 years of the latest data, used to evaluate model generalization performance in actual application scenarios. This partitioning design has important practical significance: the training set time span is sufficiently long, covering multiple complete market cycles, ensuring the model can learn patterns under various market conditions; the validation set corresponds to the post-pandemic market environment, including new market characteristics such as monetary policy shifts and rising inflation pressures, helping the model adapt to environmental changes; the test set is entirely in the period after model training, including unprecedented market events such as the latest interest rate hike cycle and AI technology breakthroughs, providing a severe test for evaluating the model’s true predictive capability. In the data preprocessing stage, we applied corresponding standardization methods for different types of data: price data was transformed through log returns to eliminate the effect of price levels; fundamental data used rolling Z-score standardization, maintaining temporal characteristics while eliminating dimensional differences; event data was encoded into fixed-dimension vector representations through pre-trained BERT models; relationship data was normalized to ensure comparability across different relationship types. These preprocessing steps laid a solid foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation. To comprehensively evaluate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net, we carefully selected eight representative baseline models that cover the complete spectrum from traditional statistical methods to the latest deep learning techniques, providing thorough validation of our method’s effectiveness and advancement. Traditional statistical models: We selected ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)33 as the representative of classical time series prediction methods. ARIMA has good theoretical foundations and interpretability, is widely applied in financial time series prediction, and provides an important benchmark for evaluating the improvement magnitude of deep learning methods. Classical deep learning models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)7 as a representative of recurrent neural networks, can effectively handle long sequence dependencies and is a classical method in the time series prediction domain. TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)34 adopts causal convolution design, has advantages in parallel training and good long-term dependency modeling capability, representing the application of convolutional neural networks in time series prediction. Attention mechanism models: Transformer9 as the pioneering work of attention mechanisms, achieves direct modeling of relationships between arbitrary positions in sequences through global self-attention mechanisms. Informer35 introduces sparse attention mechanisms based on Transformer, specifically optimized for long sequence prediction tasks, improving computational efficiency. Multimodal and relationship modeling methods: DUET36 as the direct foundation of our work, adopts dual clustering mechanisms to model in temporal and channel dimensions respectively, representing advanced methods in current time series prediction. MM-LSTM (Multimodal LSTM)37 fuses multiple data sources into the LSTM framework, providing baseline reference for multimodal time series prediction. Simple decision-focused baselines: To establish fundamental performance benchmarks, we include two essential naive baselines that represent the most basic prediction strategies. The No-Change baseline assumes that stock returns will be zero for all prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis that prices follow a random walk without predictable drift. The Market Index baseline predicts individual stock returns based on the historical beta relationship with the NASDAQ-100 index: where \(\beta _{AMZN}\) is estimated using a 252-day rolling window of historical returns prior to the prediction date. This baseline represents a simple factor model approach commonly used in practical finance. These fundamental baselines are essential for validating that sophisticated models provide meaningful improvements over the most basic prediction strategies. All baseline models adopt the same data partitioning strategy and evaluation metrics, ensuring experimental fairness. Hyperparameters were optimized through grid search on the validation set, with each model achieving its optimal configuration. To comprehensively evaluate model prediction performance across different time spans, we adopted two complementary evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary metric can effectively measure the deviation between predicted and true values, is sensitive to outliers, and meets the needs of financial risk management. Coefficient of determination (\(\text {R}^{2}\)) as an auxiliary metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability and facilitates understanding of relative model performance. We set three prediction time spans: 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day, corresponding to the practical needs of short-term trading, medium-term investment, and long-term allocation respectively. This multi-horizon setup can comprehensively evaluate model generalization capability under different prediction difficulties. To ensure result reliability, all experiments were conducted in the same hardware environment using the same random seeds and training strategies. Each model was fully trained until convergence and evaluated on the test set for final assessment. Several important trends can be observed from the quantitative results in Table 7: Overall performance ranking: DAFF-Net achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion approach. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM and DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, demonstrating the importance of multi-source information fusion. Among unimodal methods, DUET as the most advanced baseline performed best, proving the value of the dual clustering concept. Prediction difficulty analysis: The performance of all models declined as the prediction time span increased, which aligns with general rules of financial prediction. Interestingly, DAFF-Net’s relative advantage is more pronounced in long-term prediction (20-day), with \(\text {R}^{2}\) reaching 0.51, while the strongest baseline MM-LSTM only achieved 0.45, representing a relative improvement of 13.3%. This indicates that our method has significant advantages in handling complex long-term dependencies. Method type comparison: Traditional statistical method ARIMA performed worst across all metrics, reflecting the limitations of linear methods in handling complex financial data. Deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods, with attention mechanism methods (Transformer, Informer) outperforming traditional recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of attention mechanisms in capturing long-term dependencies. Relative improvement magnitude: Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67) in 1-day prediction. Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net reduced MSE by 10.5% and improved \(\text {R}^{2}\) by 9.8% in 1-day prediction, proving our technical innovation in multimodal fusion. Fundamental baseline validation: The inclusion of naive baselines provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. The No-Change baseline achieved \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.17, 0.12, and 0.08 across the three prediction horizons, representing the null hypothesis performance. The Market Index baseline, utilizing beta-adjusted market returns, improved to \(\text {R}^{2}\) scores of 0.21, 0.18, and 0.13, demonstrating the value of incorporating systematic market factors. Notably, even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental baselines, validating the necessity of time series modeling techniques. DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.2\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction \(\text {R}^{2}\), confirming that our sophisticated multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the superiority of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks, particularly showcasing unique advantages in handling event-driven market dynamics and complex asset correlation relationships. To more intuitively demonstrate the performance advantages of DAFF-Net relative to various baseline models and deeply analyze the performance differences of different models on multi-time horizon prediction tasks, we conducted comprehensive analysis of experimental results through various visualization methods. First, to clearly compare the prediction errors of all models across different prediction time horizons, we used bar charts to display the comparison results of MSE metrics. MSE comparison bar chart for different models. Several important characteristics can be clearly observed from Fig. 6: First, DAFF-Net achieved the lowest MSE values across all three time horizons, where the yellow bars (1-day MSE), orange bars (5-day MSE), and red bars (20-day MSE) are all significantly lower than all other baseline models, validating the superiority of our method. The inclusion of fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index) provides essential context for evaluating model sophistication. These naive baselines achieved MSE values of 0.0312–0.0351 and 0.0298–0.0342 respectively, representing the most basic prediction strategies. Even the traditional ARIMA model substantially outperformed these fundamental approaches, validating the necessity of sophisticated modeling techniques. Second, the MSE values of all models increased significantly with increasing prediction time horizons, which aligns with general rules of time series prediction—long-term prediction is more challenging than short-term prediction. Particularly noteworthy is that the traditional ARIMA model achieved an MSE of 0.0348 for long-term prediction (20-day), almost 1.5 times that of DAFF-Net (0.0228), highlighting the advantages of deep learning methods in handling complex nonlinear relationships. The gaps between deep learning models are more pronounced in long-term prediction, indicating that the importance of architectural design becomes increasingly prominent as prediction difficulty increases. Next, to analyze the trend of each model’s explanatory capability with changing prediction time horizons, we displayed the variation patterns of R2 metrics across different prediction horizons through line charts. R2 score variation trends for different models. Figure 7 reveals the intrinsic patterns of model performance variation with prediction time horizons. From the figure, it can be observed that all models’ R2 scores show a declining trend with increasing prediction time horizons, but the decline magnitudes differ significantly. The fundamental baselines (No-Change and Market Index, represented by the bottom two lines) demonstrate the poorest performance, with R2 scores declining from 0.17 and 0.21 respectively in 1-day prediction to merely 0.08 and 0.13 in 20-day prediction. DAFF-Net (red line) maintained the highest R2 scores across all time horizons, particularly achieving an excellent performance of 0.67 in 1-day prediction, significantly surpassing all other methods. The performance gaps between different model categories become increasingly evident as prediction horizons extend: fundamental baselines plateau at very low R2 values, traditional statistical methods (ARIMA) show steep decline from 0.41 to 0.22, while sophisticated deep learning methods maintain more gradual degradation. DAFF-Net’s decline is remarkably stable, from 0.67 to 0.51, demonstrating superior stability and generalization capability. Notably, the spread between the best and worst performing models expands from 0.50 in 1-day prediction (0.67–0.17) to 0.43 in 20-day prediction (0.51–0.08), indicating that advanced modeling becomes even more critical for longer-horizon forecasting. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate the performance differences between DAFF-Net and major competitors from multiple dimensions, we selected the three best-performing models for radar chart comparison analysis. Comprehensive performance radar chart of DAFF-Net vs. baseline models. Figure 8 displays the performance of the three best models—DAFF-Net, DUET, and MM-LSTM—across six key dimensions through radar chart format. The six axes of the radar chart correspond to MSE-1d, MSE-5d, MSE-20d, R2−1d, R2−5d, and R2−20d respectively, where MSE metrics are transformed by reciprocal to maintain consistent directionality with R2 metrics (larger values indicate better performance). From the chart, it is evident that DAFF-Net (red line) forms the largest coverage area, outperforming or at least equaling the other two baseline models across all six dimensions. Particularly noteworthy is that DAFF-Net’s advantages are most significant in dimensions related to long-term prediction (MSE-20d and R2−20d), which again confirms the effectiveness of our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms in handling complex long-term dependencies. DUET (yellow line), as the direct foundation of our work, is surpassed by DAFF-Net in all dimensions, validating the value of our technical improvements. MM-LSTM (orange line), although also adopting multimodal fusion strategies, still lags behind DAFF-Net in performance, indicating that our innovations in fusion mechanism design have substantial improvement effects. Based on the results of the above visualization analysis, we further conducted precise quantitative evaluation of DAFF-Net’s performance improvements. Fundamental baseline validation demonstrates the substantial value of sophisticated modeling: DAFF-Net’s performance represents a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the No-Change baseline and a 3.9\(\times\) improvement over the Market Index baseline in 20-day prediction R2 (0.51 vs 0.13), confirming that our multimodal approach provides meaningful predictive value beyond the most basic strategies. Compared to the strongest unimodal baseline DUET, DAFF-Net achieved significant improvements in 1-day prediction tasks with MSE reduction of 15.2% (from 0.0171 to 0.0145) and R2 improvement of 15.5% (from 0.58 to 0.67). In the more challenging 20-day prediction task, the improvement magnitude is even more prominent, with MSE reduction of 12.3% (from 0.0260 to 0.0228) and R2 improvement of 21.4% (from 0.42 to 0.51). Compared to the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net also demonstrated stable performance advantages. In 1-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 10.5% and R2 improved by 9.8%; in 5-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 7.4% and R2 improved by 7.0%; in 20-day prediction tasks, MSE decreased by 9.2% and R2 improved by 13.3%. These quantitative results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed event-driven temporal pattern extraction and multi-dimensional relationship-aware fusion mechanisms. The hierarchical performance structure revealed by our comprehensive baseline comparison validates the progressive value of modeling sophistication: fundamental baselines (No-Change, Market Index) establish the baseline performance floor; traditional econometric methods (ARIMA) provide moderate improvements; deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN, Transformer) achieve substantial gains; and multimodal fusion methods (MM-LSTM, DAFF-Net) deliver the highest performance. Crucially, DAFF-Net’s 13.3% improvement over the strongest multimodal baseline MM-LSTM in 20-day prediction demonstrates that sophisticated fusion mechanisms provide meaningful benefits even among advanced multimodal approaches. Particularly worth emphasizing is that DAFF-Net’s relative advantages are more pronounced in long-term prediction, which has important significance for practical financial applications. In quantitative investment and risk management, the ability to accurately predict market trends over longer time horizons is often more valuable than short-term prediction, as it provides more sufficient time windows and more stable strategic foundations for investment decisions. Our experimental results indicate that through effective integration of event information and multi-dimensional relationship information, DAFF-Net can better capture long-term patterns in financial markets, thus having greater potential value in practical applications. To validate the individual contributions of DAFF-Net’s core technical innovations, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies by systematically removing or replacing key components. This analysis demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of each proposed module. We design six ablation variants to isolate the contribution of each major component: DAFF-Net-NoEvent: Remove the entire event-driven temporal pattern extractor, using only price time series data DAFF-Net-NoRelation: Remove the multi-dimensional relationship-aware module, using only temporal features DAFF-Net-SingleRel: Replace multi-dimensional relationships with frequency-domain relationships only DAFF-Net-HardCluster: Replace soft clustering with hard k-means clustering (k=8) DAFF-Net-NoFusion: Remove contextual factor fusion, using simple concatenation instead DAFF-Net-NoRouter: Replace event-aware router with simple concatenation of events and time series Each ablation variant maintains the same training procedure and hyperparameter settings to ensure fair comparison. Table 8 presents the performance degradation when each component is removed or simplified. The ablation results reveal several important insights about the relative importance of different components: Event-Driven Module (Highest Impact): Removing the event-driven temporal pattern extractor causes the largest performance degradation (10.1% to 15.9% across metrics), confirming that event information provides crucial predictive signals that pure price-based models cannot capture. The impact is particularly pronounced for longer prediction horizons, supporting our hypothesis that events provide valuable information for understanding market narratives. Multi-Dimensional Relationships (Significant Impact): Complete removal of relationship modeling results in 6.1% to 9.9% performance loss, demonstrating the importance of cross-asset information. Interestingly, the relationship module’s contribution is more consistent across prediction horizons compared to the event module. Multi-Dimensional vs. Single-Dimensional Relationships: Using only frequency-domain relationships (DAFF-Net-SingleRel) leads to 3.5% to 5.6% degradation compared to the full multi-dimensional approach. This validates our hypothesis that different relationship types capture complementary information about asset correlations. Soft vs. Hard Clustering: The soft clustering mechanism provides consistent but moderate improvements (2.0% to 4.1%) over hard clustering. While the improvement is smaller than other components, it demonstrates the value of preserving nuanced relationship information. Contextual Factor Fusion: The specialized fusion mechanism contributes 4.8% to 7.6% improvement over simple concatenation, highlighting the importance of carefully designed information integration. Event-Aware Router: The sophisticated event routing provides 3.1% to 5.2% improvement over naive event concatenation, validating the value of learned event-pattern matching. To understand how components interact, we examine cumulative ablation effects (Table 9): The cumulative analysis shows that: (1) Core innovations (event processing + multi-dimensional relationships) contribute 21.6% of total performance; (2) Complete removal of all innovations results in 35.3% performance degradation; (3) The final price-only configuration performs similarly to advanced unimodal baselines like Transformer, validating our baseline comparisons. We observe interesting interaction effects between components: Event-Relationship Synergy: When both event and relationship modules are present, their combined effect (21.6% improvement) exceeds the sum of individual contributions (13.7% + 9.1% = 22.8%), suggesting slight negative interaction. This may indicate some information overlap between event signals and cross-asset relationships. Fusion Mechanism Dependency: The fusion module’s contribution increases when both primary streams are active, indicating that sophisticated fusion becomes more valuable as input complexity increases. This comprehensive ablation study confirms that each proposed component contributes meaningfully to DAFF-Net’s performance, with the event-driven module providing the largest individual benefit and multi-dimensional relationship modeling providing substantial complementary value. To evaluate the generalizability of DAFF-Net beyond the primary Amazon case study, we conducted additional validation experiments on a diverse set of stocks representing different sectors and market characteristics. This cross-asset analysis addresses concerns about sector-specific overfitting and demonstrates the broader applicability of our methodological approach. We selected four representative stocks from distinct sectors to provide comprehensive cross-validation: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Healthcare/Pharmaceutical sector, representing defensive value stocks with stable fundamentals and lower volatility JPMorgan Chase (JPM): Financial services sector, exhibiting strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events and interest rate changes ExxonMobil (XOM): Energy sector, characterized by commodity price dependencies and cyclical behavior patterns Tesla (TSLA): Electric vehicle/Technology sector, representing high-growth, high-volatility stocks with strong event-driven characteristics These assets were chosen to span the spectrum of market behaviors: from stable dividend-paying value stocks (JNJ) to highly volatile growth stocks (TSLA), from cyclical commodities exposure (XOM) to interest rate sensitive financials (JPM). Table 10 presents the comparative performance of DAFF-Net against the three strongest baseline models (DUET, MM-LSTM, Transformer) across all five assets for 20-day prediction tasks. The cross-asset validation reveals several important patterns: Consistent Performance Gains: DAFF-Net achieved performance improvements across all five assets, with MSE reductions ranging from 8.5% to 9.7% and \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvements from 10.2% to 15.4% compared to the strongest baseline MM-LSTM. This consistency suggests that our methodological innovations provide robust value across different market segments. Sector-Dependent Improvement Magnitudes: The relative improvements varied by sector characteristics. Energy stock XOM showed the largest \(\text {R}^{2}\) improvement (15.4%), potentially due to the sector’s strong sensitivity to macroeconomic events, which our event-driven approach effectively captures. Healthcare stock JNJ showed more modest improvements (10.2%), consistent with its lower event sensitivity and more stable fundamental-driven behavior. Volatility Adaptation: High-volatility stocks (TSLA, AMZN) and low-volatility stocks (JNJ) both benefited from DAFF-Net, though through different mechanisms. For volatile stocks, the event-driven pattern extraction provided significant value; for stable stocks, the multi-dimensional relationship modeling contributed more substantially. Event Sensitivity Correlation: Assets with higher event sensitivity (TSLA, XOM, AMZN) generally showed larger absolute performance improvements, validating the particular value of our event-aware routing mechanism for event-driven stocks. While these cross-asset results demonstrate promising generalizability, we acknowledge several limitations: (1) the validation remains within large-cap U.S. equities and may not extend to small-cap stocks, international markets, or other asset classes; (2) the 15-year study period, while comprehensive, represents specific market regimes and may not capture all possible market conditions; (3) the computational complexity of full multi-asset deployment remains a practical consideration for broader applications. The experimental results fully demonstrate the significant advantages of DAFF-Net in financial time series prediction tasks. These advantages mainly stem from our innovative breakthroughs at three key technical levels, as shown in Table 11, which presents a comparative analysis of DAFF-Net’s key technical innovations. First, the event-driven temporal pattern extractor achieves an important transition from pure data-driven to event-aware modeling38. Traditional time series prediction models, whether statistical methods like ARIMA33 or deep learning methods like LSTM7 and Transformer9, mainly rely on statistical features of historical price data for modeling. This approach often produces confusion when facing similar price patterns driven by different underlying causes16. For example, sharp stock price declines may stem from poor company performance39, industry policy adjustments, or overall market panic. Although the price performances are similar, their underlying mechanisms and subsequent evolution patterns are completely different. Our event-aware router can effectively distinguish these market patterns that appear similar on the surface but are essentially different by fusing time series data with event vectors40, thereby achieving more precise predictions. This innovation not only brings significant improvements in quantitative metrics but, more importantly, provides a new financial modeling paradigm that organically combines market “narrative logic” with “data logic.” Second, the multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module breaks through the limitations of traditional single-relationship modeling by constructing a more comprehensive and accurate asset correlation network through the fusion of relationships in three dimensions: frequency domain, fundamentals, and knowledge graphs41. Frequency domain relationships capture periodic similarities in price movements, reflecting technical correlations20; fundamental relationships are based on financial indicators and industry classifications, embodying fundamental similarities42; knowledge graph relationships quantify structured business-level connections. This multi-dimensional relationship modeling is not only more theoretically complete but also demonstrates obvious advantages in practice, particularly in capturing market systemic risks and sector rotation effects43. Compared to DUET’s36 single perspective considering only frequency domain relationships, our method can better understand complex market ecosystems, which has important practical significance for portfolio management and risk control. Third, the adoption of soft clustering mechanisms reflects our deep understanding of financial market complexity6. Unlike traditional hard clustering methods’ either-or approach, soft clustering allows assets to have different degrees of membership in multiple groups, which better aligns with actual financial market conditions44. In reality, a technology company may have industry correlations with other tech stocks, may also have connections with retail stocks due to its consumer business, and may form relationships with infrastructure stocks because of its cloud services. The soft clustering mechanism avoids information loss that hard partitioning might cause by preserving these subtle but important weak relationship information, enabling the model to capture market multi-level structures more precisely23. From deep analysis of experimental results, we found that DAFF-Net’s performance advantages are not uniformly distributed but present some interesting and meaningful patterns. The most significant finding is that the model’s relative advantages are more prominent in long-term prediction tasks, which reflects the core value of our technical innovations45. In 1-day prediction tasks, DAFF-Net’s improvement compared to the strongest baseline is approximately 10%, while in 20-day prediction tasks, this improvement magnitude expands to 13.3%. This advantage that amplifies with increasing prediction time horizons indicates that our event-driven and multi-dimensional relationship fusion mechanisms have unique capabilities in handling complex long-term dependencies11. Short-term prediction mainly relies on recent price momentum and technical indicators21, while long-term prediction requires understanding deeper market structures and fundamental logic, which is precisely the core advantage of our model design. Further analysis of different types of baseline model performance reveals a clear performance hierarchy. Traditional statistical method ARIMA33 performed worst across all metrics, which aligns with expectations since linear models struggle to capture nonlinear characteristics of financial data1. Unimodal deep learning methods (LSTM7, TCN34, Transformer9) showed moderate performance, with attention mechanism methods slightly outperforming recurrent and convolutional methods, demonstrating the advantages of global dependency modeling. Multimodal methods (MM-LSTM37, DAFF-Net) significantly outperformed unimodal methods, validating the value of multi-source information fusion24. Notably, even within multimodal methods, DAFF-Net significantly outperformed MM-LSTM, indicating that simple feature concatenation or early fusion is insufficient to fully exploit the potential of multimodal data and requires carefully designed fusion mechanisms like ours. From the perspective of different evaluation metrics, DAFF-Net achieved consistent improvements in both MSE and \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics, indicating that the model’s advantages are comprehensive and stable. MSE as an absolute error metric reflects prediction accuracy; \(\text {R}^{2}\) as a relative metric reflects the model’s ability to explain data variability. Simultaneous improvement in both metrics indicates that DAFF-Net can not only reduce prediction errors but also better understand and explain the intrinsic patterns of financial data. This consistency has important significance for practical applications, as it demonstrates that the model’s improvements are substantial rather than incidental advantages in specific metrics. Table 12 further quantifies this performance improvement across different time horizons, revealing the sources and distribution characteristics of our technical advantages. Despite DAFF-Net’s excellent performance in experiments, we must objectively recognize the limitations of current research, which provide important guidance for future research directions46. First, while we conducted cross-asset validation on five stocks from different sectors, the scope remains limited to large-cap U.S. equities. Our primary analysis focuses on Amazon with supporting validation on four additional stocks (JNJ, JPM, XOM, TSLA). Although choosing Amazon has sufficient reasons (strong market representativeness, rich data, obvious event-driven characteristics), this single-target validation strategy still limits the universality of conclusions. Stocks in different industries have different price behavior characteristics, with significant differences in driving factors between cyclical industries (such as steel and chemicals) and growth industries (such as technology and biotechnology), and vastly different volatility patterns between traditional value stocks and emerging concept stocks13. Therefore, model performance in other asset classes (such as bonds, commodities, foreign exchange) and different market environments (such as emerging markets, small-cap stock markets) still needs further validation. Second, the complexity of technical implementation may affect the actual deployment efficiency of the model. The acquisition, processing, and encoding of event data is relatively complex, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple news sources, announcement platforms, and economic data release channels, which places high demands on data infrastructure and processing capabilities47. The construction and maintenance of knowledge graphs also require professional domain knowledge and continuous updating mechanisms. In comparison, traditional models based on price data are more straightforward to deploy. This technical complexity may limit the application of models in resource-constrained environments, particularly for small and medium-sized investment institutions. From a computational efficiency perspective, DAFF-Net’s multi-branch architecture and complex fusion mechanisms bring additional computational overhead. Although this overhead is acceptable in modern GPU environments, it may become a limiting factor in application scenarios that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as high-frequency trading4. Additionally, although the model’s interpretability has improved compared to pure black-box methods (through event routers and attention mechanisms), it still needs further enhancement in model decision transparency and interpretability for strictly regulated financial environments31. Looking toward future research directions, we believe there are several important development opportunities worth exploring. First is expanding validation scope by applying the model to more asset classes and market environments, constructing large-scale multi-asset prediction systems27. This can not only validate model universality but may also discover cross-asset synergies and systemic risk transmission mechanisms29. Second is technical optimization directions, including developing more efficient event information extraction and encoding methods, exploring lightweight model architectures, and researching incremental learning mechanisms to adapt to dynamic market environment changes. Third is enhancing model interpretability through visualization techniques and factor decomposition methods to make model decision processes more transparent, enhancing user trust and regulatory compliance46. Finally is exploration of practical applications by integrating the model into complete quantitative investment and risk management systems, validating performance and commercial value in real trading environments47. We believe that with in-depth research in these directions, event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods will play increasingly important roles in future intelligent financial systems. While DAFF-Net demonstrates superior predictive performance, practical deployment requires careful consideration of infrastructure requirements, implementation complexity, and cost-benefit trade-offs. This section provides a realistic assessment of deployment challenges and offers scalable implementation strategies for different institutional contexts. Full Implementation Requirements: The complete DAFF-Net system demands substantial technical infrastructure: Real-time Data Pipeline: Continuous ingestion from multiple news feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, PR Newswire), SEC EDGAR filings, and macroeconomic data sources, requiring robust data streaming architecture and 24/7 monitoring Natural Language Processing Infrastructure: High-performance GPU clusters for real-time BERT encoding of news articles and announcements, with typical latency requirements under 100ms for trading applications Knowledge Graph Maintenance: Quarterly updates requiring domain expertise to verify corporate relationships, supply chain changes, and regulatory reclassifications from multiple authoritative sources Computational Resources: Training infrastructure requiring NVIDIA A100-class GPUs and substantial memory for handling large-scale multimodal datasets Estimated Implementation Costs: Initial setup: \(\$200\text {K}-500\text {K}\) for infrastructure and data subscriptions Annual operational costs: \(\$150\text {K}-300\text {K}\) for data feeds, cloud computing, and maintenance Personnel requirements: 2–3 FTE including ML engineers, data engineers, and domain experts Recognizing that full implementation may be prohibitive for smaller institutions, we propose several graceful degradation strategies that preserve significant portions of DAFF-Net’s performance benefits: Tier 1: Simplified Event Integration Data Sources: Limit events to earnings announcements, major news headlines, and Fed policy statements Processing: Use pre-trained sentence transformers instead of full BERT encoding Update Frequency: Daily batch processing instead of real-time streaming Performance Impact: Retains approximately 80% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 60–70% lower than full implementation Tier 2: Relationship-Only Implementation Focus: Implement only the multi-dimensional relationship module Data Sources: Use publicly available fundamental data and static knowledge graphs Event Component: Replace with simple sentiment scores from free news APIs Performance Impact: Retains approximately 60% of full model improvement Cost Reduction: 80% lower than full implementation Tier 3: Academic/Research Implementation Data Sources: Historical data only, using archived news and fundamental databases Processing: Offline batch processing suitable for research and backtesting Knowledge Graph: Simplified using Wikipedia/DBpedia relationships Performance Impact: Full research validation capability Cost: Under \(\$10\text {K}\) annually for academic research Phased Implementation Strategy: Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Implement Tier 3 version for backtesting and validation on institutional data Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Upgrade to Tier 2 with live fundamental data and basic event processing Phase 3 (Months 7–12): Full Tier 1 implementation with comprehensive event integration Phase 4 (Year 2+): Optimization and customization for specific use cases Risk Mitigation Strategies: Fallback Mechanisms: Maintain traditional LSTM/Transformer models as backup predictors Data Quality Monitoring: Implement automated data quality checks and anomaly detection Model Validation: Continuous out-of-sample testing and performance monitoring Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all data sources and model decisions meet financial regulatory requirements Large Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {10B}}+ {\textbf {AUM}}\)): Full implementation justified by potential alpha generation exceeding infrastructure costs. Conservative estimate of 0.5–1.5% annual alpha improvement can generate \(\$50-100\)M additional returns, easily justifying \(\$500\)K annual costs. Medium Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {1-10B AUM}}\)): Tier 1 implementation recommended. Estimated 0.3–0.7.3.7% alpha improvement generating \(\$3-70\)M additional returns versus \(\$200\)K annual costs provides strong ROI. Small Asset Managers (\(\${\textbf {100M-1B AUM}}\)): Tier 2 implementation most appropriate. Even 0.2–0.4.2.4% alpha improvement generates \(\$200\)K-4M additional returns versus \(\$100\)K costs, maintaining positive ROI. Individual/Retail Investors: Tier 3 implementation suitable for educational purposes and personal portfolio management, with minimal costs and research-focused benefits. To facilitate broader adoption and academic research, we commit to: Open Source Release: Core model architecture and Tier 3 implementation within 6 months of publication Documentation: Comprehensive implementation guides and tutorials API Development: RESTful APIs for simplified integration with existing trading systems Community Support: GitHub repository with active maintenance and community contributions This practical implementation framework demonstrates that while DAFF-Net represents a sophisticated advancement in financial prediction, it can be deployed at various scales and resource levels, making its benefits accessible to a broad range of market participants. This study proposes the Dual-stream Alpha Factor Fusion Network (DAFF-Net), an innovative deep learning framework specifically designed for financial time series prediction tasks. Through the organic combination of an event-driven temporal pattern extractor and a multi-dimensional relationship-aware channel soft clustering module, DAFF-Net successfully addresses the limitations of traditional financial prediction models in handling complex market narratives and inter-asset correlations. Comprehensive experimental validation on Amazon stock data demonstrates that DAFF-Net significantly outperforms eight representative baseline models including ARIMA, LSTM, Transformer, and DUET across 1-day, 5-day, and 20-day prediction tasks, achieving 7.4%−15.2% improvement in MSE metrics and 7.0%−21.4% enhancement in \(\text {R}^{2}\) metrics compared to the strongest baselines, with particularly outstanding advantages in long-term prediction tasks. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of deep fusion of event information with multi-dimensional relationship information, providing new technical pathways and theoretical contributions to the field of financial time series prediction. Although current research still has limitations such as limited data coverage and complex technical implementation, DAFF-Net’s core concepts and technical framework open important directions for the development of quantitative investment, risk management, and intelligent financial systems, with broad application prospects and research value. Future work will focus on expanding model validation in multi-asset and cross-market environments, optimizing computational efficiency and deployment convenience, and further enhancing model interpretability to promote the widespread application of event-driven and relationship-aware financial prediction methods in actual financial business.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs this week — not to cut costs or chase AI, but because they didn't fit the culture. That's according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who shared his thoughts about the layoffs for the first time during the company's quarterly earnings call on Thursday. "The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least," Jassy said, referring to the job cuts announced on Tuesday. "It really — it's culture." Jassy's remark aligns with his broader mission to reshape Amazon's culture this year, which Business Insider chronicled. He is trying to raise performance standards, enforce discipline, and eliminate bureaucracy. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts on Tuesday in a blog post, explaining that despite the company's strong performance, it is reducing jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world. "This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote. Tuesday's layoffs marked Amazon's biggest job cut since it shed 27,000 positions in late 2022. On Thursday's call, Jassy said Amazon's rapid growth in recent years created "a lot more layers" that have slowed decision-making. He emphasized that, with the ongoing AI transformation, there has never been a more critical time for the company to operate leaner and move faster. "Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work," Jassy added. "And it can lead to slowing you down." Amazon isn't the only Big Tech giant embracing the "Great Flattening." Google and Microsoft have been trimming layers of managers too, aiming to move faster and shed corporate bloat. Amazon also revealed that last quarter's layoffs came with an estimated $1.8 billion in severance costs. Have a tip?

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Mastercard may soon make a significant investment to fully enter the crypto space. According to Reuters, the company is in advanced talks to acquire Zero Hash for roughly $1.5 to $2 billion, a move that, if completed, would fold a regulated crypto-settlement network into one of the world’s largest payment processors. On the surface, it looks like another corporate experiment with digital assets. Underneath, it’s something bigger: an attempt to rebuild the plumbing of money itself around stablecoins, not banks. Zero Hash isn’t a consumer-facing brand but the quiet infrastructure behind several tokenization efforts. Founded in 2017, it’s regulated as a money transmitter across the US, holds a New York BitLicense, and operates under equivalent virtual-asset frameworks in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The firm already processes flows for issuers such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Republic, enabling their tokenized funds to move value across twenty-two chains and seven major stablecoins. Earlier this year, it raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation, led by Interactive Brokers, with backing from Morgan Stanley, Apollo, and SoFi. This demonstrates that traditional finance is treating on-chain settlement less like a curiosity and more like a utility. For Mastercard, the attraction is obvious. Its network moves trillions each year but remains tethered to the old calendar of money: weekday clearing, T+1 or T+2 settlement, closed on weekends. Zero Hash runs twenty-four hours a day. Owning it would enable Mastercard to settle card and account-to-account payments in regulated stablecoins, compressing those delays to T+0 while keeping everything within its compliance perimeter. The company has hinted at this direction before, with its “wallets-to-checkouts” stablecoin pilot launched in April 2025, but that was still a sandbox. A purchase would turn it into infrastructure. The timing couldn’t be better. Stablecoins now total more than $300 billion in circulation, with monthly on-chain settlements of around $1.25 trillion, according to a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 report. Most of that volume still flows between exchanges and DeFi protocols; however, a rising share comes from cross-border payouts and fintech wallets, the very niches where card networks have struggled to maintain high margins. Visa has already partnered with Allium to publish stablecoin analytics, Stripe quietly re-enabled USDC settlements, and PayPal is running its own token. Mastercard risks disintermediation unless it controls a comparable rail of its own. Zero Hash also sits at the intersection of two fast-growing markets: stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Much of the $35 billion now locked in on-chain real-world-asset products, mainly short-term T-bills backing stablecoins, moves through entities like it. That gives Mastercard an entry point not only into consumer payments but also into institutional treasury flows, a part of the market where instant, programmable settlement could replace the slower web of correspondent banks and clearinghouses. The overlap of these two systems, consumer payouts and institutional liquidity, may explain why Mastercard is willing to pay roughly twice Zero Hash’s last valuation. If the deal closes, it would mark the first time a tier-one card network owns a fully regulated stablecoin processor outright. The broader context is a quiet arms race. Visa, Stripe, and even Coinbase are investing in fiat-to-stablecoin bridges to capture future settlement fees. Each knows that whoever runs the compliant, always-on layer between bank accounts and blockchains will effectively own the next generation of payments. Mastercard’s move reframes that race: rather than experiment on the side, it is pulling the rails in-house. There are hurdles. Zero Hash’s licenses will require change-of-control approvals from state regulators, the NYDFS, and European authorities under MiCA. Those sign-offs could take months. And while the US Senate’s stablecoin bill passed earlier this year, it still awaits full enactment. Yet the direction of policy is clear. Both the US and EU frameworks now treat fiat-backed stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, establishing reserve and disclosure standards that institutional users can accept. That clarity lowers the reputational risk for Mastercard to integrate them directly. The economics are enticing. Even a sliver of global stablecoin flow could generate material revenue if monetized like a network. A 0.75% share of the $12 trillion annualized stablecoin volume would give Mastercard roughly $90 billion of addressable settlement activity. At a blended take-rate of 12-20 basis points, that’s $100 to $180 million in potential yearly revenue, small next to its $25 billion top line but growing far faster than card transactions. And unlike interchange, those fees accrue around data, compliance, and liquidity, not consumer spending. The bigger prize is strategic. As more money lives on-chain, card networks must decide whether to compete with or become the settlement layer. Mastercard appears to have made its choice. Zero Hash offers not just APIs and licenses but a template for how traditional payment giants might survive the shift: by absorbing the crypto infrastructure before it absorbs them.

Apple is on a record-setting streak. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up more than 3% in extended trading Thursday, topping their recent highs after the iPhone maker posted earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates and CEO Tim Cook gave an upbeat outlook for the holiday season. Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue that rose 8% year-over-year to $102.47 billion. Both figures came in ahead of analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, as Apple's services revenue climbed to a record high of $28.75 billion. Growth in Apple's iPhone sales also helped drive the better-than-expected results, after the company launched its iPhone 17 lineup in September. Sales of iPhones rose 6% to $49.03 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing the bulk of Apple's product revenue. The figure also represented a September quarter revenue record for the iPhone, with CEO Tim Cook suggesting that could mean a record holiday season ahead. "We expect December-quarter revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone," Cook said on the company's earnings call Thursday, anticipating 10% to 12% revenue growth. Analysts were looking for 6%. Apple shares were up about 8% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, making it the word's second-most-valuable company behind only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).

Title: Amazon CEO Says 14,000-Person Layoffs Weren’t Due to AI or Finances: ‘It’s About Culture’

“It’s important to be lean,” Andy Jassy says as he touts the tech behemoth as “the world’s largest startup” Amazon’s 14,000-person layoffs earlier this week weren’t necessarily driven by financial or AI factors, CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. Instead, the primary motivation behind cutting the workforce was “culture,” he explained. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now. It’s culture,” he told analysts on the call, explaining that as Amazon grew dramatically over the last few years, the company added more “layers” that became cumbersome to its decision-making process. “When that happens, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down,” he said. Jassy continued: “As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and that means removing layers, it means increasing the amount of ownership that people have and it means inventing and moving quickly. I don’t know if there’s ever been a time in the history of Amazon, or maybe business in general, with the technology transformation happening right now where it’s important to be lean, important to be flat, it’s important to move fast, and that’s what we’re going to do.” When Amazon cut 14,000 people on Tuesday, Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, cited the need to be nimble in the AI era in a note to staff. “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” she wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” The layoffs may not be over yet, although Jassy did not indicate more to come on Thursday’s earnings call. The company has plans to replace more than half a million jobs with robots in the coming years, believing it can leverage new technology to avoid filling hundreds of thousands of roles, according to the New York Times.

Title: Do ETFs risk centralizing Solana, and who actually gets the yield?

Hong Kong’s 1.99% fee product and US staked wrappers set up a split: unstaked AUM nudges native rewards higher while stake-through funds risk validator concentration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana spent years building a staking culture in which over two-thirds of the circulating supply is delegated to validators, earning roughly 6% annually from inflation and fees. Non-staking Solana ETFs might just change this dynamic. Now that reflexive on-chain participation faces a new competitor: exchange-traded funds that either cannot or will not stake. Hong Kong’s ChinaAMC Solana ETF began trading on October 27 with an explicit mandate not to stake any of its SOL holdings, while the US already runs three stake-enabled products: the REX-Osprey’s SSK, the Bitwise BSOL, and the Grayscale GSOL. These funds direct their custodian to delegate and distribute rewards net of fees. The split creates a natural experiment: will large pools of non-staking ETF capital drain Solana’s validator economy, or will the yield feedback loop pull liquidity back on-chain? The answer depends on which model scales. Non-staking ETFs impose a pure fee drag; for example, ChinaAMC’s ongoing charges amount to 1.99% in year one, effectively turning what would be a 6% staking yield into a negative 2% tracking difference versus the spot rate. Stake-enabled funds, such as SSK, can deliver a positive carry, passing through roughly 4.8% to 5.1% after accounting for the fund’s 0.75% expense ratio and custodian-validator infrastructure fees. But that convenience comes with a risk of centralization. SSK’s prospectus allows the custodian to choose validators, and the fund also holds stakes in non-US ETPs that themselves delegate large blocks of SOL. If a few custodians direct billions of dollars in delegations, Solana’s consensus power and MEV routing concentrate in the hands of institutional gatekeepers rather than in community choice. Solana’s staking reward model is self-correcting by design. Inflation distributes SOL to all stakers proportionally, so when the staked ratio falls, the same reward pool is split among fewer participants, lifting the per-staker APY. This creates an incentive for capital to flow back on-chain until a new equilibrium is established. The math is straightforward: if circulating supply sits around 592.5 million SOL and the baseline staked ratio is 67%, then $1.5 billion in non-staking ETF AUM (roughly 7.5 million SOL at $200 per token) would shift the staked ratio to about 65.7%. APY scales inversely, rising from 6.06% to roughly 6.18%, a 12-basis-point bump. Push AUM to $5 billion, and the lift reaches 41 basis points, while $10 billion nudges it 88 basis points higher. The implication is that non-staking ETFs don’t gut on-chain yields; they gently raise them. The larger the unstaked pool, the more attractive native staking becomes for anyone who can hold SOL directly and delegate to a validator. That’s a very different dynamic from “ETFs drain staking,” the initial fear when spot products were first proposed. Instead, non-staking funds act as a subsidy to on-chain participants, concentrating rewards among those who continue to stake while institutional capital sits inert in brokerage accounts. Stake-enabled ETFs change the calculus. If funds like SSK delegate their holdings, the staked ratio barely changes, so APYs remain near the baseline. But the validator set receiving those delegations is determined by custodian relationships and fund sponsor policy rather than community signaling or performance metrics. SSK’s design allows it to hold other staked ETPs alongside directly delegated SOL, creating a layered structure where multiple intermediaries, such as fund sponsors, custodians, and ETP issuers, each take a fee slice and decide where stake flows. That’s operationally similar to how Lido concentrates Ethereum staking through a curated set of node operators, but without on-chain governance or the composability of a liquid staking token. Ethereum’s stETH precedent is instructive but inexact. Lido grew Ethereum’s staking participation from low single digits to over 30% of supply by offering liquidity and yield in a single wrapper. At its peak, Lido controlled roughly 32% of staked ETH, raising concerns about centralization that prompted governance efforts to cap and diversify the number of node operators. The share has drifted down to the mid-20s as competitors like Rocket Pool and EigenLayer have offered alternative staking paths. Still, the core lesson holds: liquid, yield-bearing wrappers amplify participation and centralize power unless actively managed to distribute power. Solana’s ETF landscape doesn’t mirror that trajectory. Many products, especially in Asia, are explicitly non-staking, meaning they can’t concentrate validator power even as AUM scales. Those that do stake, like SSK or European products from CoinShares and 21Shares, yield less than native liquid staking tokens. CoinShares’ Physical Staked Solana ETP charges no management fees and delivers a net yield of approximately 3% after deducting validator commissions. At the same time, 21Shares’ ASOL reinvests rewards but charges a 2.5% annual fee, compressing the pass-through. Native LSTs like JitoSOL or Marinade typically deliver 5 to 6% with minimal fee drag and full on-chain composability. The yield gap means staked ETFs appeal primarily to accounts that cannot custody crypto directly, such as retirement plans, registered investment advisors, and regulated institutions, not to users who can stake natively and capture the full reward stream. The real risk is delegation concentration within the subset of funds that stake. If a handful of custodians receive the bulk of institutional delegations, Solana’s validator set tends to skew toward entities with robust compliance infrastructure and US legal footprints. That’s a different security profile than a widely distributed validator set chosen by individual stakers based on performance, decentralization ethos, or MEV-sharing policies. It’s not inherently worse, but it shifts control of block production and transaction ordering, and it makes validator economics more dependent on custodian relationships than on community endorsement. The SEC’s September adoption of generic listing standards lowered the bar for exchanges to list spot crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. That regulatory shift opens the door for mainstream issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, to file Solana products if they see demand. JPMorgan’s base case projects $1.5 billion in first-year US inflows for SOL ETFs, a fraction of the $20 billion-plus that flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, but still meaningful at roughly 1.3% of Solana’s circulating supply. If most of that capital lands in non-staking funds, native APY ticks up modestly. If stake-enabled products dominate, validator concentration accelerates. Scale beyond the base case becomes interesting. A $5 billion AUM scenario, plausible if Solana’s price rallies and multiple low-fee US issuers join the market, would represent over 4% of supply. If held unstaked, that lifts on-chain APY by 41 basis points, making native staking more attractive and likely pulling some liquidity back on-chain. If staked via ETFs, the validator set receiving those delegations becomes a structural feature of Solana’s consensus, with custodians directing billions in stake based on operational rather than economic signals. Either path redistributes staking income more than it drains total staked SOL, but the composition of who stakes and who earns matters for both security and decentralization. Europe offers a preview. CoinShares and 21Shares have operated large staked Solana ETPs for over a year, demonstrating that institutional staking pass-through is operationally feasible at scale. Those products haven’t led to a collapse in Solana’s staking participation; they’ve simply added a new class of institutional holders who capture yield through regulated wrappers. The US market will likely follow a similar pattern, with the added wrinkle that American custody and compliance requirements may funnel delegations to a narrower set of validators than Europe’s more fragmented ETP landscape. The next phase hinges on three variables. First, which validators receive ETF delegations? SSK’s prospectus allows custodian-directed delegation, and if a few large validators, those with deep compliance infrastructure and US legal presence, capture the bulk of institutional stake. Solana’s validator economics then tilt toward entities that can service ETF custody, rather than those that prioritize maximizing decentralization or community engagement. Tracking public disclosures and on-chain delegation data will reveal whether ETF flows diversify or concentrate. Second, actual AUM run-rate versus the $1.5 billion base case. If Solana’s price rallies or if US retail and institutional demand surprises, the scale question shifts from “does this matter” to “how fast does this reshape the validator set.” Monitoring fund creation data, CME Solana futures open interest for basis trades, and AP hedging flows will provide early signals of ETF traction. Third, governance. Solana’s 2025 SIMD-228 proposal aimed to make inflation dynamic with respect to the staking rate, thereby dampening the APY feedback loop that currently rewards on-chain stakers when ETFs hold SOL that is unstaked. The proposal didn’t pass, but the debate shows the community is actively considering policy that could mute the “fewer stakers, higher APY” mechanic. If a successor lands, the economics of ETF versus native staking change, potentially tilting the equilibrium toward more unstaked holdings if policy smooths out the yield advantage. The broader narrative is less about stETH than about custody and defaults. Liquid staking tokens on Ethereum succeeded because they preserved composability and liquidity while delivering yield. Solana’s ETFs split the atom: non-staking funds offer liquidity without yield, and stake-enabled funds offer yield without composability. The winner depends on who the marginal buyer is. Retirement accounts that can’t custody crypto will take the ETF route, while on-chain users will continue to stake natively to capture full rewards and maintain control over delegation. The question isn’t whether ETFs drain staking, but whether the institutional capital they unlock stays passive or begins steering Solana’s validator economy from the inside.

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Amazon shares jumped 10% on Thursday as the company’s third quarter numbers beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines by a lot and by even more for the closely watched Amazon Web Services, or AWS, division. Revenue rose 13% to $180 billion for the September quarter and jumped 20% at AWS. Total net income per share of $1.95 was a big beat including gains from investments in Anthropic. Operating income was flat at $17.4 billion including a $2.5 billion FTC settlement and a $1.8 billion in estimated severance charges related to planned job eliminations. Those came this week when it announced a hefty 14,000 layoffs across divisions with video games among the hardest hit and departures of creative executives across Amazon MGM Studios. Just 10 days ago, Amazon Web Services was the target of national and international ire as a major outage took down its own suite of apps and websites from Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa, to other major sites from Signal, WhatsApp and Snapchat to IMDb, Disney+, Fortnite, Roblox and Wordle among many others. Watch on Deadline So the company badly needed some good at AWS, which is its window to AI. Investors were also pleased with the company’s guidance. “We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,” said CEO Andy Jassy. “AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY. We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.” He said the e-commerce giant is on track “to deliver to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever again this year, expand same-day delivery of perishable groceries to over 2,300 communities by end of year, and double the number of rural communities with access to Amazon’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery.” The company ticked off an army of bullet points as it does each quarter, now mostly around AI but with a few entertainment shout-outs. They were: 70 million+ viewers globally for The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 (through seven days post-finale), global viewership growth for second consecutive season (exceeding Season 2 by 65%), and the announced feature film; kicking off fourth season of Thursday Night Football on Prime Video, averaging 15.3 million viewers (the best for TNF on any network in a decade) according to Nielsen, which is a 16% increase over last season’s seven-game average; debuting NBA on Prime in more than 200 countries, delivering average audience of 1.25 million viewers in the U.S. during a season-opening doubleheader, according to Nielsen; adding Peacock Premium Plus and Fox One to Prime Video add-on subscription offerings of 100+ channels in the U.S.; and launched the reimagined Luna cloud gaming service, including GameNight, a new collection of living room games, at no additional cost to Prime members.

Title: Amazon Stock Pops as Earnings Top Estimates, Driven by AWS Growth
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-stock-pops-as-earnings-top-estimates-driven-by-aws-growth-11839134

Amazon (AMZN) shares popped in extended trading Thursday after the e-commerce and cloud giant posted third-quarter results that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growth in its cloud business. The shares were up over 13% above $253 after hours, at what would be their first all-time high since early February. The online retail and cloud computing provider reported earnings per share of $1.95, up from $1.43 the same time a year ago, and well above the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $180.2 billion, also beating expectations as sales in the company's Amazon Web Services segment jumped 20% to $33 billion. Like many of its big tech peers, Amazon faces pressure to show its investments in AI are paying off, and Thursday's strong showing from its cloud business and the ensuing jump in Amazon's stock would point to growing optimism about its trajectory. "We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business," said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, adding that the company has particularly benefited from "strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity." Looking ahead, Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to come in between $206 billion and $213 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $208.66 billion. The company also lifted its projected capital expenditures for the full year to $125 billion from about $118 billion previously, with CFO Brian Olsavsky telling investors during Thursday's earnings call he expects it to rise in 2026. Earlier this week, Amazon announced what could be its largest layoffs in the company's history, with plans to reduce its headcount by about 14,000 jobs, through layoffs and changes to hiring plans as it and other tech companies look to trim costs elsewhere as they boost investments in AI infrastructure. Through Thursday's close, the shares were up less than 2% for 2025, as concerns about tariffs and disappointing cloud growth earlier in the year weighed on sentiment around the stock. This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share prices.

More Info Previously, we reported that Saudi Arabia is digging in for a "long and shallow" oil price war as it looks to regain market share from rivals like U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ members who have been exceeding their production quotas. This comes after Saudi Arabia made significant production sacrifices to support prices for over three years, which allowed competitors to increase their output. Saudi Arabia has also been hedging its oil price bets by rapidly diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels in recent years, expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), sports and tourism. Indeed, Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih has revealed that non-oil activities now drive more than half the country’s GDP, with that percentage growing. And, the battle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for Middle East AI supremacy is quickly heating up. The two countries are not only spending heavily to beef up their AI infrastructure, including building some of the world’s largest data center clusters, but are also forming strategic alliances with U.S. tech giants. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy has singled out AI as vital to the country’s economic transformation, with 70% of its goals involving data and AI. Related: Too Much of a Good Thing: Solar Overloads Europe’s Electricity System Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain has launched a $10 billion venture capital fund called Humain Ventures dedicated to investing in AI startups across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Humain Ventures is a key part of Saudi Arabia's larger strategy to become a global hub for AI, and a key part of its Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification. Launched earlier in the current year, Humain has already begun deploying capital into AI infrastructure projects. In pursuit of its AI ambitions, Humain also entered into significant partnerships with major U.S. technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service AWS, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and giant data center REIT Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). Back in May, Oracle announced a $14 billion investment in Saudi Arabia's digital cloud and AI infrastructure over 10 years, as part of its commitment to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. This investment will expand the company's cloud and AI presence by building a comprehensive network of data centers, including existing regions in Riyadh and Jeddah and planned expansions in NEOM and Dammam. AWS and Humain have announced a joint $5 billion investment to build an AI zone in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, Equinix has announced plans to build a $1 billion data center in Saudi Arabia to meet surging demand for AI, cloud and enterprise workloads. The UAE has also launched a slew of AI investments. Last year, the Abu Dhabi government launched MGX, a technology investment company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. The fund was founded as a partnership between Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and the AI and cloud computing company G42. MGX focuses on AI infrastructure (data centers and connectivity), Semiconductors (chip design and manufacturing) Core AI technologies and applications (software, data, and robotics). At its launch, MGX had a target of managing over $100 billion in assets, making it one of the largest funds in the world dedicated to AI. Since its March 2024 launch, MGX has made several high-profile moves, showcasing its ambition to become a major player in the global AI industry. In September 2024, MGX formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) dubbed the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to invest up to $100 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Nvidia is a key partner of GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI factories and data centers. Meanwhile, Stargate UAE is a massive AI data center cluster in Abu Dhabi, developed in partnership between the Emirati AI firm G42 and US tech giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Stargate UAE is the first international deployment of OpenAI's ambitious global AI infrastructure initiative, also named "Stargate". Positioned as a "national infrastructure," Stargate UAE will provide the country with its own powerful and secure AI capabilities as part of the UAE's broader strategy to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on external technology infrastructure. The project's central feature is a 1-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with an initial 200-megawatt phase planned to be operational by 2026. This facility will be equipped with advanced Nvidia hardware to meet the massive computational demands of training and running large AI models. Further, Abu Dhabi has unveiled plans to invest AED 13 billion (equivalent to $3.54 billion) in its Digital Strategy 2025–2027, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully "AI-native" government by 2027. The strategy aims to automate 100% of all government processes and integrate AI into all digital services.

Title: Is AI Leading to Layoffs or Does the Economy Just Suck?

Reading time: Reading time 4 minutes It’s not a particularly good time to be a (human) worker in America. Tens of thousands of people have been laid off over the past several days, and the general outlook for job-seekers appears grim, to say the least. This week, Amazon announced plans to neutralize some 14,000 positions, while Meta said it would purge several hundred people from various offices throughout California and Washington state. Chegg, the online learning platform, announced plans to reduce its workforce by a whopping 45 percent on Monday. Several other large American companiesâincluding FedEx, Paramount, General Motors, Target, and UPSâsimilarly announced plans to eliminate jobs. The consensus seems to be that this sudden employment blood bath may just be the birthing pangs of the new AI ageâa time in which jobs are no longer an indicator of economic success, I guess. Headlines about the layoffs have routinely included AI as a factor, a trend encouraged by the companies themselves. Indeed, in Amazon’s announcement about its new downsizing, the company’s executive, Beth Galetti, cited AI, noting that the company needs to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Similarly, in its layoffs announcement, Chegg cited the “new realities of AI” as a factor. But is it really AI’s fault, or is it just the case that the American economy is currently riding a one-way ticket to the trash heap? Is an AI-ified economy one with fewer jobs? Or does a bad economy just mean more AI? Or are the companies suffering from other ailments and simply leaning into the AI narrative for cover? NBC News recently interviewed an economic scholar who seemed skeptical of the narrative surrounding job loss and AI. âItâs much easier for a company to say, âWe are laying workers off because weâre realizing AI-related efficienciesâ than to say âWeâre laying people off because weâre not that profitable or bloated, or facing a slowing economic environment, etc,ââ David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. âWhether or not AI were the reason, youâd be wise to attribute the credit/blame to AI,â he added. BBC, meanwhile, recently interviewed Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University, who felt that the AI talk was overblown. “A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,” Gimbel told the outlet. “But so far, nothing that I’ve seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle.” In other words, companies may be simply saving face by pretending that losing team members and downsizing is really just part of a glorious pivot towards “leaner,” “more efficient” automation. In reality, these companies may be hurting and may be taking advantage of the current narrative around AI to spin that hurt into PR gold. If you’re a large company, you’d be forgiven for not feeling your best these days. Indeed, the indicators for the U.S. economy right now are, in a word, bad. Conveniently for Trump, the U.S. government continues to be shut down, which means that the organizations that would traditionally monitor and report on the nation’s economic health (like the Fed) are unable to do their jobs. However, even without official government analysis, financial experts are expressing skepticism about the health of the economy. For instance, Morningstar, a financial services firm that specializes in economic analysis, recently noted that U.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was lower than in previous years, and that this growth slump is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with consumers becoming more and more cautious about spending. Additionally, consumer sentiment and the strength of the labor market have both been weakening, the report says, citing the most recent job growth data provided by the government: There are multiple ways to look at the health of the US labor market, which is tied to the overall health of the economy. Job growth is a primary indicator…The US economyÂ added just 22,000 jobs in AugustÂ as unemployment continued to rise. That number is well below what economists had previously expected and the 79,000 reported in July. The revised June numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the US economy lost 13,000 jobs in June. The report also notes that inflation has continued to stick around, and the price of goods has shot up “in response to tariffs, as producers started passing along higher import prices.” In short, due to the Trump administration’s bizarre policies, there is a lot of economic uncertainty right now, and uncertainty, as we all know, isn’t great for markets. As an example, next month, the Supreme Court is set to rule on whether Trump’s tariffsâwhich have been challenged by lawsuitsâare legal or not. If they prove to be illegal, the Trump administration may have to facilitate the repayment of all of the revenue generated by those tariffs, which would be logistically insane and a hugely disruptive process for the federal government. As we all know, uncertainty is, itself, not great for an economy, since, to confidently maneuver and make money, businesses need to know that they can put one foot in front of the other without falling down a manhole. So are layoffs happening because more companies are adopting AI or because the economy is doing poorly? Or for some other reason? From the outside, it’s impossible to tell, but suffice it to say, there is definitely more than one possible explanation for why companies are currently shedding jobs like nobody’s business.

Title: Goldman Sachs survey says only 11% of companies are actively linking layoffs to AI—but the real shock is yet to come

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. While the latest wave of AI-linked layoffs has put job seekers—and even the Federal Reserve—on high alert, a new survey from Goldman Sachs suggests the real AI labor meltdown is still to come. The report, which surveyed more than 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers, found that only 11% of their clients across industries such as tech, industrials, and finance were actively cutting employees as a result of AI. Instead, 47% of the bankers reported their clients were disproportionately using AI to boost productivity and revenue, while only a fifth were mostly using the tech to cut costs. “AI use has so far been more skewed toward raising productivity/revenue than reducing costs,” wrote analysts led by Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of global investment research Jan Hatzius. The catch: A much higher percentage (31%) of tech, media, and communications companies were cutting jobs because of AI. This caveat is reflected in the spate of mass layoffs that large tech companies have conducted over the past couple of months. Amazon earlier this week was the latest—laying off 14,000 middle managers as the company prepares for a new world of advanced AI with a “leaner” workforce. Other companies such as Salesforce and tech-focused consultancy Accenture have together added tens of thousands of workers to the pile of AI-related layoffs in the past few months. The headlines have been so bleak that Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve is watching carefully. While companies may not be laying off workers now, bankers believe more layoffs could occur in the next few years. Over the next year, the bankers predict their clients will push forward a 4% general decrease in headcount, while over the next three years, those headcount reductions could skyrocket to 11%. The worst-affected category for future layoffs is financial institutions, which bankers predict could see a 14% reduction in general headcount over the next three years. Tech, which has been among the quickest to adopt AI, could see slightly lower cuts of 10%. “The relatively fast increase in expected adoption and headcount reductions over the next three years highlights that AI impacts on the U.S. labor market could arrive sooner than expected,” wrote the Goldman analysts. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Palantir CTO Thinks AI-Driven Mass Unemployment Is a ‘Fundraising Shtick’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/palantir-cto-thinks-ai-driven-mass-unemployment-is-a-fundraising-shtick-2000679584
Time Published: 2025-10-30T19:20:26Z
Full Content:
Reading time: Reading time 4 minutes The chief technology officer of one of the most consequential mass-surveillance companies in the world, Palantir, thinks that artificial general intelligence is a fantasy and that the narrative that AI will replace jobs is a marketing tactic. “I think the secularists in Silicon Valley are filling the God-shaped hole in their heart with A.G.I,” Sankar told the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday. “The doomerism of Silicon Valley is both a fund-raising shtick, where the Frontier Labs can say: My technology is so powerful, it’s going to lead to mass unemployment, so you better invest in me, or you’re going to be poorâand also itâs divorced from any sort of reality,” Sankar said. He isn’t the only one who has raised skepticism over the future of AI and its relationship to labor. AGI, sometimes referred to as superintelligence, is a yet-to-be-developed AI system that could theoretically outperform human intelligence on virtually all scales. It has become the holy grailÂ for AI-first Silicon Valley companies likeÂ Meta, which has undertakenÂ a multibillion-dollar spending spree to be the first to reach it. Many experts warnÂ of theÂ perils of AGI if it is achieved, while others are skeptical that the technology can ever reachÂ that level of sophistication. But AI need not evolve into superintelligence before it can start fundamentally shifting the way our society operates. The most recent and major hit has been to labor. CEOs across industries have been open about their plans to have AI replace current or potential future workers as a profit-maximization effort. Amazon just recently laid off 14,000 corporate workers, citing the “transformative” potential of AI. Meanwhile, a recent Stanford study found that AI might have already started disproportionately crushing the young graduate job market. Still, despite all these findings, many remain suspicious. New York University professor of management and organizations Robert Seamans told Gizmodo in August that AI adoption across the corporate sector remains relatively low. Instead of AI being the culprit behind the layoffs, Seamans thinks it’s a scapegoat for the performance of the firm, because it’s much harder to blame tariffs or economic uncertainty for hiring reductions. Others, like author Cory Doctorow, believe that bosses “love the story” of AI overtaking the workforce because they want to have workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” Doctorow thinks that AI can’t successfully replace the work of many workers and there might be some evidence to back this up. An MIT study in August found that corporate AI pilots are not good at generating real revenue gains. But of course, Sankar’s observations on just how powerful AI technologies can get might be at least partially self-motivated, and Ross Douthat, the New York Times columnist interviewing him, pointed this out to Sankar pretty clearly. “Itâs in your interest, in a way, to convince yourself that the moral stakes of your work is always going to be somewhat constrained,” Douthat said. The moral backlash to their work has been something Palantir has had to deal with in recent years. Palantir’s self-proclaimed moral purpose is to build technologies to be used as a force for good, according to Sankar. That purpose is hard to grasp when seen in conjunction with Palantir’s prolific work as a defense contractor and surveillance technology provider. Sankar himself is rather passionate about “optimizing the kill chain,” something that he talks about in almost every interview, and he made sure to mention several times in this one. When asked if Palantir’s software was involved in the Trump administration’s controversial strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Sankar just said: “Yeah, our software is deployed ubiquitously across the military.” Palantir also works with the U.S. government, and particularly ICE, to help turbocharge their surveillance efforts. In August, ICE announced that Palantir would build a $30 million surveillance platform called ImmigrationOS to help with the agency’s mass deportation campaign. Then, an Amnesty International report from August found that AI products by American companies like Palantir were used by the Department of Homeland Security to target non-citizens who speak out for Palestinian rights. “I think a lot of the policies, a lot of things that people are struggling with right now in the U.S., were voted on at the ballot box. What ICE is doing was voted on at the ballot box,” Sankar said to justify the company’s involvement. When asked how Palantir determines which governments to work with and what projects to say yes to, Sankar said that they look for legal use, trust in the government, and potential for misuse and abuse. So it’s rather surprising that they have an ongoing strategic partnership with the Israeli military, whose actions in Gaza amount to a genocide according to UN authorities. Late last year, Storebrand Asset Management, a major Norwegian investor, sold all of its Palantir holdings due to concerns about international human rights violations. The company shared that an analysis indicated that Palantir aided an AI-based IDF system that ranked Palestinians based on the likelihood to launch âlone wolf terroristâ attacks, which then led to preemptive arrests. Sankar is adamant that Israel is a morally appropriate partner. Earlier this year, Sankar was among four Silicon Valley executives to join the U.S. Army Reserve as officers, the other three being Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, and current OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil. His decision to join, he says, was inspired by his “observation in Israel after Oct. 7.” “Israel is an incredibly technical country. Bountiful resources of technologists,” Sankar said. “The IDF got more modernization done in four months after Oct. 7 than in the 10 years that I’d worked with them prior.” Perhaps Palantir’s claims to being a force for good are also, in their own way, a “fundraising schtick.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Δ Officials at the country’s largest bank told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Thursday (Oct. 30) that JPMorgan had tokenized a private-equity fund on its blockchain platform for the wealthy clients served by its private bank. “For the alternative investments industry, it’s just a matter of time that a blockchain-based solution is going to be adopted,” Anton Pil, head of global alternative investment solutions for JPMorgan’s asset management arm, told the WSJ. “It’s more about simplifying the ecosystem of alternatives and making it, frankly, a little easier to access for most investors.” For example, a tokenized fund allows all parties to share one real-time view of who owns what and who has paid up on their investment promises, the report said. This helps lessen the surprises that come with “capital calls,” or the requests from private fund managers to investors to offer up a portion of the capital they had committed. According to the WSJ, this move comes ahead of JPMorgan’s wider rollout next year of its fund tokenization platform, Kinexys Fund Flow. That platform pulls in data from fund managers, distributors and administrators, creates smart contracts representing fund ownership, and allows for the near-instant exchanging of cash and assets on the blockchain. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Tokenization, the report said, allows the bank to offer clients a digital representation of the ownership of an asset kept on a blockchain ledger. As the WSJ noted, banks that have expressed a past wariness of cryptocurrencies have nonetheless argued for the potential of blockchain technology. The recent passage of the Genius Act, which established a regulatory framework for stablecoins has ushered in a broader wave of tokenization. Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon announced a partnership in July to launch digital tokens that confer ownership of money-market funds managed by their asset management operations as well as investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. This partnership, PYMNTS wrote, isn’t simply about faster transactions, but rather “about programmable liquidity and a treasury function that increasingly operates in real time.” And it’s happening against a backdrop of pro-crypto regulatory momentum — such as the Clarity Act — and interest from the traditional financial sector and that sector’s largest clients. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” For all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage, subscribe to the daily Digital Transformation Newsletter.

Title: Creatorverse: Laid Off? Consider the Creator Economy

Time Published: 2025-10-30T19:00:00Z

As Paramount and Amazon undergo a fresh round of cuts, creators are offering new opportunities Boo! Did I scare you? Well if I didn’t, the state of Hollywood right now probably will. This past week has been a rough one. On Tuesday, Amazon announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs to keep up with this “generation of AI,” layoffs which impacted the company’s video games and publishing divisions. And then there’s Paramount. As part of the company’s new cost-cutting strategy under David Ellison, Paramount will reportedly be laying off 2,000 employees in the coming weeks. But as bleak as these axings are, there is one area that’s hiring. Yep, it’s the creator economy. From 2022 to 2024, Los Angeles employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, workers in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. As the creator space has gotten bigger, its biggest players have created their own media companies. These businesses are often created with the goal of expanding a creator’s audience and turning their reach and popularity into a more passive and sustainable revenue stream. To make that happen, a lot of these creators have been turning to Hollywood alum. And at the pace some of these creators are moving, they need good experienced people, stat. Take Sean Atkins, the president and CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, who originally came from MTV and Discovery. There’s also Corie Henson, the former head of NBC unscripted TV who moved to Beast Studios. As I’ve spoken to more creators, there seems to be a shift from solely recruiting other digitally-native personnel to bringing in people with more experience in traditional media. Or as one high-ranking creator exec told me, “They’re looking to add adults to the room.” This broadening doesn’t just apply to creator-made companies. There’s also been a boom of companies designed to support creators like Kajabi and Raptive on the tools and strategy side; Night and Digital Brand Architects on the agency side; and QYOU Media on the advertising side. If these companies haven’t already started hiring from film and television pools, they’re at least talking about it. G&B Digital Management, a creator-focused management company founded by Kyle Hjelmeseth, even hosts workshops to help actors, crew members and creatives in traditional media pivot to the creator economy. The next one is coming to Brooklyn on Nov. 12. This isn’t meant to sugarcoat a truly sucky week. Thousands of talented people are getting booted from their jobs. And the ones who are still lucky to be employed are either panicking about their futures (hello Warner Bros. Discovery!) or are spread so thin they can barely breathe. But amid all the horror, there is a small sliver of hope. Now onto the rest. Kayla Cobb Senior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com IShowSpeed freaks out over AI deepfakes MrBeast isn’t the only mega creator panicking over the state of AI. During a livestream last week, IShowSpeed (45 million YouTube subscribers) watched several deepfake videos of himself generated by Sora 2, OpenAI’s latest model. Speed admitted that giving the app permission to use his likeness publicly was a mistake and said, “Whoever told me to make it public, chat, you’re not here for my own safety, bro. I’m f–ked.” So he’s not a fan. Tubi ups its creator bets with Hartbeat and Audiochuck Tubi, the free ad-supported streamer owned by Fox, upped its creator investments in two major ways this week. First up is a deal with Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat for four movies, the streamer’s first exclusive deal for creator content. Two of the upcoming movies will come from Kinigra Deon (5.5 million YouTube subscribers) and 85 South Show (3.4 million Instagram followers). That was on Wednesday. On Thursday, Tubi announced a multiyear deal worth $150 million with Audiochuck, the media company from Ashley Flowers that’s behind “Crime Junkie,” “The Deck” and “So Supernatural.” As part of the deal, Tubi will have exclusive distribution and advertising sales rights and will develop a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel. No wonder Tubi got so many shoutouts during this quarter’s earnings call. NASCAR and Night partner on creator-focused series with TimTheTatman, Emiru and more NASCAR is tapping creators as part of its effort to expand to younger audiences. The upcoming Creator Series, launched in partnership with the digital talent agency Night, will be hosted by NASCAR analyst Mamba Smith and will see professional driver Carson Hocevar race alongside eight top creators. The creators taking the wheel include: The four-event series will run through October through February and will be available to watch across Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. TikTok creators can earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions During TikTok’s Creator Summit, the company announced creators can now earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions. As the name implies, subscriptions let fans can gain access to paywalled content from TikTok creators. The platform also introduced two new AI-powered tools. Smart Split automatically edits longer content into multiple shortform videos. Then there’s AI Outline, which helps creators generate video titles, hashtags, hooks and outlines for their videos. Netflix is experimenting with vertical videos but swears it’s not competing with TikTok At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Netflix Chief Technology Officer Elizabeth Stone said the company is starting to experiment with more vertical videos, which is home to shortform content. But Stone promised the company isn’t trying to compete with TikTok or the emerging shortform drama trend. Remember when Netflix promised it wasn’t going to have ads? Or it wasn’t going to invest in live sports? Or when it swore “Stranger Things” wasn’t coming to theaters earlier this month? So sure, Netflix. YouTube partners with Adobe, settles Disney lawsuit It was a big week for YouTube. As part of Adobe’s new slate of AI toolsfor creators, the company announced a partnership that will add a Create for YouTube Shorts option to the app version of Premiere (I’ve been trying it out, and that platform is seriously awesome). YouTube also announced a series of updates to optimize watching videos in the living room. In the past year, YouTube channels earning six-figure paydays from TV viewership increased by 45%. YouTube and Disney also settled their ongoing legal feud over Justin Connolly, the former Disney employee who’s now YouTube’s global head of media and sports. Oh, and Alphabet posted its first $100 BILLION quarter. Very casual, guys. Steven Bartlett’s company backed by Slow Ventures at a $425 million valuation Slow Ventures and Apeiron Investment Group backed Steven Bartlett’s company Steven.com at a $425 million valuation. Bartlett is behind the podcast “Diary of a CEO,” which has 13 million subscribers on YouTube and is routinely included on lists of the most listened to and watched podcasts. The exact investment amount hasn’t been disclosed. By the way, Kamala Harris stopped by Bartlett’s podcast today. Shorthand Studios hires BuzzFeed alum Zack Evans You know how at the top I said creator companies are looking to hire Hollywood talent? They’re also looking at media alum. Case in point Zack Evans, the BuzzFeed and Cameo alum who was just hired as Shorthand Studios’ VP of creative strategy. Shorthand Studios is the content and production studio under Underscore Talent. Kaya Yurieff and Jasmine Enberg launch Scalable to cover the business of the creator economy The Information’s former creator expert Kaya Yurieff is going off on her own. On Thursday, Yurieff and eMarketer alum Jasmine Enberg announced the launch of Scalable, their new venture dedicated to covering the business of the creator economy. Scalable will be partnering with The Lighthouse, Whalar Group’s creator campus. Stapleview “SNL” may wanna watch its back because Stapleview’s content has been crushing it lately.

Title: ESRT Closes Q3 2025 With Strong Fundamentals But Muted Leasing Numbers

Time Published: 2025-10-30T18:14:27Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) reported an increase in visitors to its eponymous building, along with fewer leases in the third quarter of 2025 as its portfolio reaches critical capacity. Net operating income from the observatory at the Empire State Building saw a modest increase to $26.5 million — up slightly compared to $24.1 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis — but it still hasn’t reached the $28.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, the real estate investment trust said Thursday. The decrease in visitations has been attributed to tourism being negatively impacted by international politics, according to ESRT. Leasing velocity across its entire portfolio, both retail and office, was down from 232,108 square feet in the second quarter to 87,880 square feet in the quarter ending Sept. 30. ESRT explained to investors during an earnings call that the drop was due to its available spaces reaching capacity. In the third quarter, ESRT’s notable lease deals included a 19,883-square-foot renewal and expansion for Jencap Group at 1350 Broadway, and a 16,402-square-foot renewal for Haver Analytics at One Grand Central Place. Occupancy increased 80 basis points to 90.3 percent across its Manhattan portfolio. ESRT reported 150,000 square feet of leases currently in negotiation, and 500,000 square feet of Manhattan office vacancies. “We have less space to lease, and a portion of our Manhattan office vacancy is held off-market in connection with our assemblage of large block opportunities at several properties in response to market demand, which will provide strong long-term results,” an ESRT spokesperson said. ESRT’s portfolio is optimized to protect against possible market contraction through layoffs at big companies like Amazon — which just cut its headcount by 14,000 people — according to ESRT Chairman Tony Malkin, who emphasized that he is in talks with enough potential new tenants that he does not see the job market being an immediate cause of concern. “Everybody we speak with comes to us for the quality of our portfolio, and several of them have migrated from what would be thought of as glass and steel buildings,” Malkin said. “We still have ongoing expansion within our portfolio from existing tenants. There are all kinds of reasons people might not expand, but we don’t see any of them playing out right now.” Funds from operations was 23 cents per diluted share compared to 26 cents in the third quarter of 2024, which equates to about $61.2 million compared to $69.2 million, respectively, over the same periods. Malkin reiterated his agnostic stance on politics, specifically in terms of how leasing could be impacted by the presumptive victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Nov. 4 mayoral election. “We do policy, not politics,” Malkin said. “So whoever shows up, whatever administration arrives, that’s the one with which we deal, and that’s where we try to both contribute to policy and do our best work from a business perspective.” But in a more direct address to the question of whether the market is vulnerable to policies from a Democratic Socialist mayor, Malkin said he is confident that the New York City market will continue to be what it has always been to people looking to build a business and a career. “New York City has and continues to be a magnet for the job-seeking college graduates, folks who want to come and make their careers and live in a vibrant environment,” Malkin said. “And by the way, those are an awful lot of today’s voters. They are the employees. The employers are here because they want those employees.” Mark Hallum can be reached at mhallum@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Amazon Ads Business Jumps 24% From Prior Year to $17.7 Billion

$33 billion: How much Amazon made in the third quarter from its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services—up 20% year-over-year and beating analyst projections. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. $17.7 billion: How much Amazon made from advertising in the second quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year. 13%: The amount that Amazon’s total net sales increased compared to last year’s Q3 earnings, to $180.2 billion. $1.8 billion: What Amazon expects to pay in severance fees related to layoffs, which started this week when the company announced cuts of around 14,000 corporate jobs. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal both reported that the total number of affected jobs is expected to hit 30,000. -69%: The drop in Amazon’s free cash flow—down to $14.8 billion versus the $47.7 billion reported in Q3 last year—largely due to capital investments related to artificial intelligence. 60%: Increase in the number of rural communities that have access to Amazon’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery over the last four months. 250 million: How many people have used Rufus, Amazon’s generative AI shopping assistant, so far this year. The company claims people who use Rufus are 60% more likely to complete a purchase. $2.5 billion: The settlement Amazon had to pay this quarter after the FTC proved it misled people and made it exceedingly difficult to cancel subscriptions. CEO Andy Jassy kicked off Amazon’s Q3 earnings call by discussing AWS, the company’s cloud-computing business, noting that the 20% growth rate is a return to a pace the company hasn’t seen since 2022. He also teased “several” new AWS deals signed in October that haven’t yet been announced. “AWS is where the preponderance of companies data and workloads reside, and part of why most companies want to run AI on AWS,” Jassy said. The AWS growth numbers outpaced analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares jumped as much as 14% in after-hours trading. The company still has more demand for AWS services than it has capacity for, however. Currently, the bottleneck is in power, Jassy said, though it could at some point shift to chips. Amazon has added 3.8 gigawatts of power to its AWS infrastructure in the last year, with another gigawatt coming in Q4. For its advertising division, Amazon highlighted deals with Netflix, Spotify, and SiriusXM. The ads business saw 24% growth from the year prior, to $17.7 billion in revenue. Agentic commerce is coming. While it’s become very easy to buy things online when you know what you want, a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages over ecommerce when you don’t know exactly what you want, Jassy explained in response to an investor question about agentic. But that’s going to change as AI agents get better at guiding online shopping experiences, he said. “AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online,” Jassy said. “That’s really good for customers, and I think it’s really good for Amazon, because at the end of the day, you’re going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value, and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably.” Kathryn Lundstrom is ADWEEK’s commerce and sustainability editor.

Title: Apple Is Set to Report Earnings Today. Here's What You Need to Know

Apple (AAPL) is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street analysts looking for strong results on the top and bottom lines. After some signs of a strong start to early sales of the iPhone 17 lineup, bullish analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley recently told clients their expectations around Apple's results have climbed, with that momentum likely to carry into an upbeat outlook for the current quarter and winter holiday season. More details around widely anticipated artificial intelligence features and potential plans for a foldable phone in 2026 could also drive more enthusiasm for Apple's stock, they said. Options pricing suggests traders expect Apple stock could move about 3% in either direction by the end of this week following the company's earnings call, which could drive the stock to a new record. This hasn't been an easy year for Apple, amid lingering concerns that its AI efforts have lagged those of many of its Big Tech peers. However, strong results today and comments around plans for fiscal 2026 could help lift investor sentiment. Apple shares have climbed about 8% in 2025 so far, lagging the S&P 500's nearly 17% gain, after spending some of the year in negative territory amid worries about its AI progress. Apple's gains have largely come in the last few months, after some signs of inroads with the Trump administration and easing trade policy headwinds, along with promising demand signals for the iPhone 17. The iPhone maker is seen reporting earnings of $1.77 per share on revenue of $101.61 billion, up from earnings per share of 97 cents on $94.93 billion in revenue a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. However, analysts are divided on whether the iPhone's stock still has room to rise from this week's all-time highs. The shares were up about 1% near $272 in recent trading, leaving it on track to close at a fresh high topping yesterday's record. This week's gains have boosted Apple's market capitalization above $4 trillion, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) on the list of the world's most valuable companies.

Title: The Great VC Reshuffle: OpenAI’s $500B Restructuring, A16z’s $10B Mega-Fund, and Why Two-Thirds of Series B Investments Fail

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back!! 20VC x SaaStr with Harry, Rory and Jason! Bottom Line Up Front: Three seismic shifts hit venture this week. OpenAI completed the most significant corporate restructuring in tech history, clearing the path for a potential $2 trillion IPO while Sam Altman keeps zero equity. Andreessen Horowitz raised $10 billion—but when you break down the individual funds, they’re more beatable than the headlines suggest. And new data proves what great investors always knew: two-thirds of Series B investments return less than 2x, making picking more critical than ever. Meanwhile, companies like Mercor hit $500M in revenue in record time, and the debate over when founders should sell intensifies as regulatory risk reshapes M&A. The big news this week: OpenAI successfully cut deals with Microsoft, Delaware, and California attorneys general to implement their long-awaited restructuring. They’re now a proper public benefit corporation (PBC)—similar to Patagonia—with a $135 billion charitable foundation owning roughly 20%, Microsoft owning 27%, and employees owning another 20%+. What This Actually Means: The most shocking detail? Sam Altman will have zero equity in the restructured entity. Think about that for a moment—we’re simultaneously watching Elon Musk argue for a trillion-dollar pay package while the CEO of OpenAI owns nothing in a $500 billion company. Jason Lemkin noted the absurdity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll explained the power dynamics: “It gives him in some ways more power as well as less power. You can’t assail the man for capitalism when his other billion-dollar entities are the ones that let him finish off the McLaren collection.” Microsoft emerges as a clear winner, turning their $13 billion investment into a 10x return with ongoing revenue share and Azure contracts. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” The charitable foundation also wins big—$135 billion is, as O’Driscoll put it, “a significant contribution to whatever good they hopefully will do with that money. There’s $135 billion out there that’s not going into someone’s pockets to buy yachts, boats and football teams. It’s actually going to try and solve world’s problems.” He added the historical perspective: “I would have laughed in 2016 at the people who started OpenAI saying we want to do good for the world. But at a big picture level they succeeded—they built something worth $130 billion which is a foundation that they can be proud of.” Here’s where it gets interesting for founders and investors: OpenAI now has a clear path to what could be the most popular retail IPO in history. Lemkin was direct: “I just can’t think of a retail IPO that would be more popular than OpenAI. Just bringing everyone out of the woodwork to put a little bit of their life savings into it—to ignore even if the valuation makes no sense. This would have to be the most popular retail IPO of all time, right?” O’Driscoll agreed: “I think you’re exactly right. People aren’t going to be reading the prospectus and saying maybe we won’t make profits. They’re not going to be reading the thing about $250 billion of cloud commits to third parties. They’re just going to be like, let me get some of that OpenAI.” Current math: At $500 billion with roughly $12 billion in revenue, they’re trading at ~40x revenue. O’Driscoll broke down the trajectory: “At even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion… It’s kind of, you know, 40 times gap and if it’s 20 billion it’s 25 times AR run rate. My guess is it would take two years in the normal course but you might see that euphoria moment. It’s within the trajectory, it’s within the strike zone if anything like the current growth rate continues.” But he added the critical caveat: “If you’re trading at 40 times revenues and your growth rate slows, it’s nasty and you fall sheer.” Lemkin pointed out another crucial advantage: “This unlocks maybe four times more equity for them potentially if the public markets are different than the private because of the potential valuation they could IPO. They may need that—they may need an extra 200 billion to go the distance.” O’Driscoll noted the banker feeding frenzy to come: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak and calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Everyone’s talking about a16z’s massive $10 billion fundraise, but when you break down the funds, it’s actually more reasonable than the headline suggests: Lemkin had the contrarian take: “I thought they were small. And what I mean is I didn’t think it was small until I saw the breakdown of the funds. At first when we talked about this before, I’m like 10 billion—that’s unprecedented. But when I look at that and the new Sequoia fund, $200 million Sequoia seed fund—that’s not that big compared to 20 VC… 1.5 billion for AI apps when you’re investing in 11 labs and friends and Replit doesn’t seem to get you very far.” He continued: “When you break apart the funds, I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has. And I don’t think one and a half billion for their AI app funds—I think it’s only twice the scale. So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” The Red Army Strategy O’Driscoll provided the big picture: “Andre Andreessen Horowitz is the red army of the venture industry now. They got the 10 billion and they’re going to march it forward. The amount of self-knowledge embodied in that is stunning. There’s one of my favorite expressions from the Russian Red Army which is quantity has a quality all its own. In other words, when you want to take Berlin, at some point what you do is you just get two million people willing to die and you march them forward.” But he also acknowledged the scale advantages: “It’s not of course it’s 10 billion. It’s 10 billion of 30% carry and 10 billion of 2% fees and 10 billion of all this. The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Harry Stebbings added the structural insight: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity.” O’Driscoll explained the optionality advantage: “You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. If you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high. The more bankroll you have to build up option value… the more option value you have at the back end because you have a $10 trillion fund, the easier it is to spray because you can amortize the cost of the losses over the one winner.” Stebbings noted the LP dynamic most don’t understand: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” O’Driscoll summed it up: “Bundling and rent extraction is fully understood.” While everyone obsesses over foundation models, Mercor quietly hit $500 million in revenue faster than any company in history—just 17 months to reach that milestone. They’re now valued at $10 billion, up from $2 billion just eight months ago. What They Actually Do: O’Driscoll explained the business: “They provide humans with specialist knowledge to—and their customers are the large foundation model companies—and what they do is they bring this human talent to bear to help the foundation model companies train the models by providing human feedback. You people would have heard RLHF—reinforcement learning through human feedback—these are the humans that do that.” He continued: “If I’m OpenAI and I want to teach my latest model how to do advanced math, what I need is a whole bunch of doctorates and PhDs who understand math that are available to pose questions to the model, judge model questions, give feedback on which answer is correct. By doing that, you effectively—by giving this human feedback—I think of it as you pound the model into submission where it eventually says, ‘Okay, I’ve learned this shit by adjusting the weights.'” The evolution is stunning: “Five years ago, we were labeling cats. And you had people often overseas charged with labeling cats and not getting a lot of money. I think Mercor realized that the market today is not labeling cats. It’s in fact answering complex physics questions, math questions, bio questions because the models know how to label cats now and what they need to do is the outer edges of human knowledge.” The Bull Case: Stebbings broke down the expanding value proposition: “It all started with talent acquisition—if you got the talent and could provide it, fantastic. We’ll pay you. Pillar two is get the talent, now we want data acquisition—you provide it to us, not we extract it. And you measure the quality of it too. And now we’re adding the third pillar, which is the implementation layer—we expect you to implement it efficiently and make sure our models get off the ground more effectively. And with that, you also see increased pricing and the willingness to spend much, much more from the model providers.” O’Driscoll on the growth opportunity: “The growth isn’t surprising because if you think about it, these model companies have grown faster than any company in human history. They’re spending $400 billion on compute. They’re probably spending $4 billion dollars on RLHF and they were spending zero five years ago. It’s an explosive growth market.” The Bear Case: But Stebbings identified the concentration risk: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue. So there is real revenue concentration there. It’s high quality customers but you do have that dynamic as well.” O’Driscoll was even more direct on the structural challenges: “Your margin profile is not amazing because the gross revenue is 500 million but you give 70% of it to the doctors and the mathematicians who are doing all whatever it is—some percentage I’m not going to speculate—and then the second fact you have against you is massive customer concentration. And at some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million,’ right?” He concluded with the ultimate framing: “From a long-term value extraction perspective, you prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two. When you look at those positives and negatives, this is fundamentally a bet that the AI capex train will keep running for two or three or four more years.” Lemkin added the timeline caveat: “OpenAI is not going to focus on getting efficient until it’s dealt with hyperrowth. So as long as it’s not getting efficient, you probably can lean in. If it slows down, then the positives—which is the growth rate—goes away and then all the negatives come back to bite you.” On the valuation at $10 billion with $500M revenue, Stebbings noted: “It’s only 20 times revenue. So like it doesn’t seem—this is where actually we’re seeing revenue compression.” But O’Driscoll provided the sobering underwriting math: “You should be underwriting anything to a 3x. So you got to be 30 billion to make it worth your while and 30 billion… at even at 5x revenues, my god, that’s six billion. You’re underwriting a lot of training data.” Ramp raising again at $30 billion (up from $23 billion) prompted questions about whether constant fundraising is now just part of the playbook. Why The Skepticism: Lemkin was blunt: “To me, going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough. Let’s say I was a seed investor, I’ve probably had a token of dilution. So let’s imagine I’m down to 2%, which would be great. I have a $400 million position at the last round. Right now, it’s worth $480 million with dilution after this next round. I mean, it’s a lot, but it’s not doubling my position like a classic round is.” He continued: “These little rounds—22, 25, 30—and with a lot of AI companies, a lot of dilution or a lot of others, you could see 10% annual dilution in these companies or more. You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share. It’s possible. I just don’t really care about these micro step-ups that look great—you’re like 30 billion—well if the last round was at 10, impressive. If the last round’s at three like Mercor, impressive. Here I’m like, meh, that’s cute.” Why It Makes Sense: O’Driscoll explained the capital needs: “There does appear to be a combination of insane demand for the stock, an ability to use that to create this aura of inevitability. And this is more than most companies—this is one where constant growth requires lots of capital because you’re in a capital advancing business. So you probably have every dollar you add of revenue takes $5 of capital because you got to finance purchases—you’re effectively recreating Amex. So it may well be that there’s a larger demand for capital here than the average deal.” On the valuation progression, he noted: “Someone’s lending you $4 billion of that, they’re probably going to want a $1 billion equity cushion. Going from 23 billion to 30 billion… let’s say I was a seed investor with 2%—I have a $400 million position at the last round, right now it’s worth $480 million with dilution.” The Public vs Private Debate: O’Driscoll made a critical distinction: “Another spin on what you’re saying is with the exception of the new AI companies, that probably is the kind of IRR you should expect to get in a mature growth private company. There’s really early and late stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public, could just as easily be a small midcap stock at this point in time public.” He continued: “You don’t expect midcap stocks to gap up 3x in a year—you expect the overall market will go by 11%, the best companies grow 30-40% year-on-year. There’s no reason to assume that the return to the stock should be different just because it’s held in a different corporate structure. The company is the company independent if it’s public or private.” Lemkin countered: “You just said we’re still underwriting Harry asked you what we’re underwriting to. You said at least 3x. So if I’m going to underwrite to 3x and I did the last Ramp round at 23, it’s not really getting me to my 3x.” O’Driscoll clarified: “You’re confusing your pronouns. You’re trying to underwrite to a 3x. If you’re running money doing companies at 30 billion pre, you’re probably not underwriting to an overall 3x on your fund. I don’t think you are underwriting to a 3x when you’re doing ultra late stage billion-dollar revenue run rate $30 billion valuations and you’re definitely not underwriting to a 30% IRR.” New data from Carter looked at all 547 Series B investments from 2018. The results are sobering for anyone who thinks picking doesn’t matter. The Distribution: The Math: O’Driscoll analyzed the data: “If you hit those three buckets correctly, the blended return—I know it from our fund model—is 3.7x gross, 3x net to the LP. So if you look at that business, if you get enough slots in the buckets, right, in each of the buckets—the good buckets, the 5x bucket and the 10x bucket—you end up with a 3x net to the LP. So the first piece of good news is if you do it right, the return was available to you.” But he emphasized the picking challenge: “Jason picked on the negative which is two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. And what it says is picking is so important because if you skew instead of 66%, if you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” The Brutal Truth About Series B: Only 1 in 3 Deals Even Double Investors’ Money, Per Latest Carta Data Does Spray and Pray Work? Lemkin disagreed with the spray characterization: “At series B, everyone thinks they’re a great picker, don’t they? This isn’t pre-seed. Everyone’s a great picker at series B, right?” O’Driscoll responded: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. I think if you don’t pick, if you’re not a good picker, you will end up with more… If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off. I don’t think the spray and pray strategy would work here.” He identified three distinct strategies: “There’s actually three approaches. There’s picking, there’s spraying, and then the third one which someone big like Andre can do which is optioning. You can spray if you have option value if you’re just doing options. But if you spray and that’s the only way you make your money, the probability of being wrong is just too high.” On the a16z seed strategy with 72 seed bets (compared to number two at 27), Stebbings noted: “Exactly to your point there, Rory, you said you can’t win without being a great picker. I’m not saying Andre are not great pickers, but you can if you have 72 option bets.” O’Driscoll agreed: “There are three strategies. There’s spraying, picking, and optioning. Optioning allows you to spray more. Once upon a time, you thought seed was all about option value and anything beyond that wasn’t. Because we’re dealing with gargantuan sums of money, it is now plausible that for some people A’s and B’s are partially options. If you’re going to deploy $200 million in the growth round, you don’t want to be totally slipshod at the A and the B, but you can think of it as more option value. That’s absolutely a superpower that a wall of money gives you.” Even at Seed: On whether spray works at seed, O’Driscoll did the math: “Going back to the Carter data, there were 547 series B’s in 2018. I’m going to guess graduation rate probably implies 800 A’s. That probably implies 1,600 seeds. So even what you are pejoratively calling spray and pray is doing 50 deals out of 1,600. There’s still a huge element of picking involved in that.” He identified the only exception: “The only people on the planet who have a structural business where they can de-emphasize picking because they can write checks—option checks at scale—is Y Combinator because they have a structured advantage in terms of their economics. They are the only people who’ve built a mass production seed business.” On why even the single best outcome doesn’t justify true spray: “It’ll always be true that if you pick the single largest outlier in any vintage—like if one of those deals was Figma where the B made 100x—even if it’s 300x, if you did an index and did every deal equally, it’s only a 0.2x. If you put a dollar into everything, your Figma check doesn’t return the fund. Maybe an OpenAI would—maybe there is one deal so big that it would literally return the vintage such that if you just bought the entire vintage you’re good—that probably happens maybe once every decade or two.” Synthesia, the AI video generation company at $150M ARR, reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Adobe. They’re now raising north of $3 billion instead. The Case for Selling: Lemkin was direct: “I would tell him to take it unless you’re 100% sure you’re going to build a $20 billion public company, $10 billion public company. And if you are, do it. I like to stress the test. So I’m not saying that’s the right thing to do, but I want to be the guy that gives that advice.” He continued: “Even 10 is not really worth it for a founder. It is worth it for the VCs. Excel gets another play. 3 to 10 for Excel—huge difference. So let’s say they own 15% out of a—what—$450 million fund. Instead of a 1x fund returner, it could be a two or 3x. You make that bet as a VC all day long. For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference.” On the reality of wealth: “We’ve had billionaires on our show. You’ve had billionaires, Harry. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money. It’s the same dude.” The Underrated Question: Lemkin raised the question no one asks: “There’s another thing that’s under-discussed and I’ve had this conversation twice with founders in the last 12 to 18 months in similar situations: Are you really an IPO guy? I love everything about this company, I love the founders, I love everything. There’s nothing negative. And I told them to take the offer even though I didn’t want them to as an investor. I told them to take the offer because I said, ‘You’re such a great set of founders, but I don’t know if today I see you living the public company CEO life. I just don’t see it—the way you have to do it, the constraints, the stress.'” He explained the stakes: “You have to assume it’s IPO or bust. And if you’re not that guy, then you’re going to bring in an outside CEO or it’s just a mess. So that’s the question I have: Do you really want to run a public company for real?” On the weight of being public: “I was at this Dreamforce Benioff dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know that have all been on Harry’s show and Rory’s invested in some of them. And it was great and it was fun. I got some hugs. But man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight—they weren’t stressed, no one was stressed—the weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” The Case for Taking the Risk: O’Driscoll provided the growth analysis: “Victor, I admire Synthesia enormously as a company. We tried to contact them—they didn’t get back to me. They got the deal done. I’m so disappointed. We have another investment in the space. I love the space. I admire Synthesia a ton and many of the investors there. I think the first question is how do you feel about the business? And you threw out a statistic there—they said they’re at 100 million in ARR when they took the Adobe money in April. I checked. And if they really have gone from 100 to 150 in less than 6 months, then I can make this conversation really quick. There’s no way they should sell because that thing’s exploding.” He added the category perspective: “It’s a great category. There’s a reason we made another investment in the space. We like the category. I think there’s runway there for that kind of human interface to compute.” On the LP pressure question, Lemkin pushed back: “I don’t believe that. I don’t see it. I’ve asked my LPs, I’ve asked a few others. If you’re a strong manager—okay, if you have a track record and their goal is not a 3x seed fund, but if they really want 5x or north out of you—they get the game is you got to keep playing another card. No matter what they say, I’ve asked my LP and I guess it’s a small set—do you want more money back? Even ask my most conservative LP like a university endowment that is small, that has stress—I ask you want your money back, I mean with a gain—they’re like no, we’re just telling you we’re really worried about it, like we really want DPI but we don’t want it. We want you to play another card.” O’Driscoll summarized the board conversation: “I always tell the CEO, ‘Now would be a really good time for you to look into your own heart and see how you feel. And if there’s something about the business that’s really worrying you and you haven’t told us, now would be a good time to share.’ And sometimes stuff comes out.” Stebbings added the regulatory timeline dimension: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ By which time I’ll be $400 million in revenue being acquired for $3 billion. You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times.” Amazon announced their largest white-collar layoffs ever (10% of corporate staff), is losing cloud market share (from 50% in 2018 to 38% today), and had a major AWS outage causing billions in damage. The Timing Question: O’Driscoll noted: “Contrast this with Sergey Brin coming back to Google, everything else happening. Maybe this was a tough time for your founder to leave and go to Miami. Maybe this was not—maybe it seemed like a very stable time to do a transition. Long time as CEO, but maybe this wasn’t the perfect age of maybe stepping down just before AI hit was suboptimal for Amazon.” Lemkin provided historical context: “Jeff Bezos checked out right at the peak of the last era when products were frozen in time for a decade, when AWS was the same product for a year. So are most of the companies we invested in all three of us in 2021—they were the same products as 2015. It was the great time to go to Miami because nothing was changing in the product. It was just going—just stock prices were going up in revenue, but the products were the same. So why wouldn’t you retire? There’s not going to be any change.” The Counterargument: O’Driscoll offered the alternative view: “Or maybe it was brilliant for Jeff because maybe the hook—because you’re implying in that that had he stayed all these bad things wouldn’t have happened. And it’s plausible just given his world top two or three entrepreneurial achievement of the last three decades.” But then he turned cynical: “When you’ve got a couple hundred billion dollars, my guess is you’re not maximizing money. You’re maximizing psychic pain and joy. My guess is his psychic joy in the last three or four years doing what he’s been doing has been significantly higher than the psychic pain that would have been involved in realizing you’ve never done a big acquisition in your life, you got to do a huge corporate deal in AI to matter, and all those people you hired in ’21 trying to do the right thing for COVID and expand—you all got to lay them off.” Lemkin was even blunter: “I think Bezos would lay off half his company in a fortnight if it was the right thing. I don’t think you even care.” The Problem Analysis: O’Driscoll broke down Amazon’s challenges: “The first problem is in their retail business they overinvested for COVID and now they’re trying to replace people with robotics because the technology is there and that’s just something that had to be done. And in cloud it’s less that their core AWS business has folded up. It’s like all the new compute which is 10x and 20x larger in terms of demand for these customers is AI-related compute and you’ve neither built something compelling standalone nor have you partnered—except to be fair a little bit with Anthropic. You didn’t make a meaningful partnership and you haven’t found a way to get some of that compute.” On the hyperscaler comparison: “Of the three hyperscalers in the pre-AI world, Google was able to be relevant because they had their own model. Microsoft went and rented a model from OpenAI and now the contract’s nearly up and they did it to make a lot of capital gain but they didn’t actually in my view really develop something compelling that they own from it. And you did nothing—so you lose.” Lemkin added perspective: “One thing we shouldn’t do here and you saw a lot of it with Google too is that you don’t want to overcompensate. There’s a bunch of bad news in one day and it is bad. But your position in retail is broadly good. You’re a little schlocking in terms of shopping experience but you have dominance because of your distribution and you’re doubling down on that. You’re reinvesting in robotics, you’re cutting costs. Amazon wins in their retail business because they can deliver shit faster than anyone else on the planet pretty much anywhere and you’re doubling down on that. So that’s like a win on the compute business on the AWS business. Your problem is you just—you’re not relevant in the new world. So just knuckle down and figure that out.” iRobot (Roomba) had a $1.7 billion acquisition offer from Amazon blocked by the EU “because of an incipient monopoly in the house vacuum cleaner marketplace,” as Benedict Evans sarcastically noted. The company raised $200 million in debt to bridge the deal. Now that debt is spent and they’re likely going bankrupt. O’Driscoll was emphatic: “It’s a horrible and unfair outcome for which the government and Lina Khan and the FTC is entirely responsible based on an outdated, stupid, and foolish belief about how things work beyond doubt.” The M&A Lesson: Lemkin explained the broader implication: “It’s also a reminder that when you’re going to the M&A offer like Synthesia, sometimes you’ll get the acquirer will pay a multiple that only sort of kind of makes sense—a revenue multiple that makes sense for them but you couldn’t get. And so when you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” Stebbings added the timeline problem: “If you’re a Synthesia, you’re looking at Dylan and Figma going, ‘God, do I want to put myself in that potential 18-month waiting period?’ This prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions.” O’Driscoll provided the math: “Everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, you got a 2.5x in 6 months.’ No, you didn’t. You got a 2.5x in 2 years. And this prolongs—this antitrust—this prolonged antitrust process really is kind of sand in the gears for a lot of these M&A decisions and at the margin probably pushes people to either push on or in the case of the crazy deals when the acquirer only wants the people, then they do the Silicon Valley acqui-hire routine. But when you’re buying the vacuum cleaner company, you want the freaking vacuums.” The conversation turned to a technical but critical question: Should investors optimize for IRR or multiple? Stebbings made the case for duration: “That duration period is also why I think it’s our responsibility as early-stage managers to be much more proactive in secondary markets because we get cash back way sooner. And the age-old thing of a 4x fund over 17 years is the same as a 2.5x fund over 10—and duration matters and time matters and IRR is king.” O’Driscoll provided the mathematical answer: “It’s not the only king because—I mean back to Jason’s comment—look, in this very show Jason was going, ‘Oh, it’s only a 30% IRR Ramp from the 22 billion to 30 billion.’ From an IRR perspective that looks amazing. So I don’t think IRR matters. I actually think the correct formulation of the optimization function is the maximization of multiple subject to a constraint on a minimum IRR.” He explained: “Basically you should know what your target IRR is—and let’s just say it’s 25%—you want to maximize the multiple provided you don’t dip below 25%. That’s actually what you’re trying to do. So a 30% IRR in one year isn’t as good as a 25% IRR for four years. But if you hold on too long and that 25 starts dipping to 19, 18, 17, then you’ve gone to a different place.” The reasoning: “In the end you want the maximum amount of capital to invest and you get that because you are held accountable at the investor level at the IRR basis because at some point they’re looking at you, they’re looking at the public markets and they’re saying risk-adjusted I need my 20%. So it is the constraint because it’s what prevents money from coming down the spigot to you but you’re actually trying to maximize your multiple.” The mega-funds are real and here to stay. But as Lemkin pointed out, when you break down their individual fund sizes, “I really don’t think Sequoia having $200 million is that different than what Harry has… So I just don’t think air cover is an excuse. You have to work twice as hard as they do.” O’Driscoll agreed but added the caveat: “The definition of a good strategy is if you have a strategy that doesn’t allow you to have to work that hard. And therefore by definition having 10 billion is a good strategy.” Revenue multiples are compressing for mature companies. As Lemkin noted, “Going from $23 billion to $30 billion, I don’t even consider it an up round. It’s not enough… You might go from 22 to 30 and have the same price per share.” Understanding your per-share price, not just company valuation, is critical. Stebbings emphasized: “You have concentration of buyer unlike any other industry. Two buyers are 50% plus of every one of these labeling providers’ revenue.” When a strategic acquirer offers a premium multiple, think hard about whether you’re really an IPO CEO. Lemkin’s advice: “Are you really an IPO guy? Can you really run a—do you really want to run a public company for real? The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today.” But understand the VC incentive misalignment: “For the founder, let’s say owns 10%—what the hell’s the difference? There’s no difference. We’ve had billionaires on our show. I don’t think Jeff Lawson would be living a better life with half the money or twice the money.” Factor in 18-24 months for regulatory review on any significant acquisition. O’Driscoll: “You think you’re getting this great multiple of—oh, they’re paying me 30 times revenue—but the damn thing’s going to close in 18 months, by which time you might be down to 10 times, and it’s just not going to feel that much.” And as iRobot shows, Lemkin noted: “When you get one of these deals, it’s tragic what happened to iRobot, but you got to take it.” The Carter data confirms what great investors always knew: picking matters. O’Driscoll: “Two-thirds of all deals are less than a 2x which means they just don’t help. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%. It requires a fair amount of discipline and picking to pull this off.” Companies like Mercor with massive customer concentration can grow incredibly fast, but as O’Driscoll warned: “At some point they’re going to say, ‘I’m giving you $200 million which means you’re making 30% on that—$60 million—hell maybe you do it for $40 million.’ You prefer to be OpenAI and have 800 million customers than to be Mercor and have two.” OpenAI IPO Watch: O’Driscoll: “Every banker on the planet will be making decks as we speak calling on Mr. Altman and Mr. Taylor. They might pretty much do it for half nothing just to be on the biggest IPO of all times.” Mega-Funds Everywhere: The venture industry is bifurcating. O’Driscoll: “This is the dominant modality today. These are—this is what top dog venture investing looks like. This kind of scale, this kind of dollars at work and there’s four or five other firms doing this.” AI Capex Super-Cycle: Everything from Mercor to OpenAI to AWS vs Azure is a bet on continued AI infrastructure spending. O’Driscoll: “This whole thing top to bottom is one big-ass bet on AI capex hyperrowth and as long as it keeps happening… you got to stay on the floor and keep dancing.” As Chuck Prince famously said in 2007: “As long as the music is playing, you got to get up and dance.” Private Staying Private: Companies like Stripe, Brex, and Ramp are staying private far longer than historical norms. O’Driscoll explained why: “There’s really early and late-stage venture and then there’s venture for companies that already could comfortably be public and I think we need a different word for that—it’s not even late stage—it’s private as public.” The venture game is evolving faster than ever. The winners will be those who understand not just what’s changing, but why it’s changing—and what that means for where the puck is going, not where it’s been. Jason Lemkin on Sam Altman Having Zero Equity: “We’ve got Elon Musk arguing he deserves a trillion-dollar pay package… and everyone was saying show Sam the money when he was fired as CEO over a very long weekend, right, the night of knives or whatever… Fast forward to today, that same nonprofit is still in charge and he has no shares. We’ve never seen someone own nothing, have we? Like this. Have we ever seen anybody own nothing? It’s crazy.” Rory O’Driscoll on Microsoft’s Win: “Microsoft corporate development and lawyers deserve a gold star from their shareholders in a way that frankly Microsoft R&D does not. And the proof of this is this morning Microsoft stock is up nicely. They’re like, ‘Thank you for the hundred billion. We’re up.'” Harry Stebbings on LP Bundling: “They don’t often understand the stapling that is required to be in these funds, which is if you’re an LP and you want to be in the early stage fund, you will often very often with top tier brands have to put in two times that into another fund to get that $1 in the other. And you don’t get your pick of which fund. Very often you have to be across all of them.” Rory O’Driscoll on The Spray and Pray Myth: “Everyone thinks they’re a great picker. Not everyone is a great picker. But the third sentence is you have to be a great picker to win. If you skew 75-80% in that less than 2x bucket, your math doesn’t work. And it’s not that hard to be that bad because on average it’s 66%.” Jason Lemkin on Public Company CEO Stress: “I was at this Dreamforce dinner. I saw maybe 10 public company B2B CEOs that we know… and man, the stress on those guys—you could just smell it out of the pores. The weight of being a public company CEO—it’s so heavy today. We could see it when we’d had Jeff Lawson on and Cliff didn’t have any of it at Canva—he didn’t have any of the weight crushing.” Harry Stebbings on A16z’s Structural Advantages: “That is a lot more money for management fees to pay great people. That is a lot more carry. That is a lot nicer offices which founders do get wowed by—like it or not they get wowed by it. That is a lot more events to host where you can have serendipity. There are a lot more things I think that scale and AUM buys that do increase.” Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

October 30, 2025 13:30 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino THIRD-QUARTER 2025 Continuation of the first half-year's growth dynamic Growth in net sales: +0.5% LFL in Q3 and +0.6% over the first nine months The initial results of the “Renouveau” plan are confirmed, and the Group is again reporting like-for-like net sales growth this quarter. Increase in cumulative adjusted EBITDA1 at end-September: +13% Cost cutting and the bulk of the work already carried out on streamlining the store network enabled the Group to increase its adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of the year: Compliance with the covenant and slight upturn in cash flow Improved free cash flow before financial expenses: -€39m at end-September 2025 (-€48m at end-June), underpinned by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. The Group reiterates that the basis of comparison was adversely affected by the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash flow amounted to -€198 million. The Group's liquidity1 stood at €1.22bn at 30 September 2025. Covenant requirements were satisfied, with a “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio of 7.68x at end-September 2025, below the threshold of 8.34x. The Group is maintaining its objective of returning to break-even free cash flow before financial expenses in 2026 and confirms the financial objectives set out in its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan. SALES AND ADJUSTED EBITDA In Q3 2025, net sales amounted to €2,002m, up +0.5% on a like-for-like basis, with convenience brands up +1.1% in Q3. After taking into account a -0.2-pt calendar effect and the roughly -3.5 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, Q3 sales were down -3.2%. Over the first nine months of 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €6,080m, up +0.6% like-for-like, with convenience brands up +1.1%. After considering a -0.6-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the roughly -2.9 pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand store network, total sales for the first nine months were down -2.9%. Group adjusted EBITDA stood at €456m (+13%) over the first nine months of 2025, lifting the margin to 7.5% (+106 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €112m (vs. €59m over the first nine months of 2024). Monoprix Growth was driven by food sales (+0.9%), once again underpinned by a good performance in fresh products (+2.1%), particularly fruit and vegetables, which continued to benefit from marketing initiatives including the price repositioning initiated in H1 2025. Non-food sales were stable this quarter, as the Fashion & Home segment continued to outperform the market. Monoprix also continued to develop its "La Cantine" food concept, launched in April, with the roll-out of 3 additional stores in Paris and the Paris region, bringing the number of stores converted to the new concept by end-September to 6, with the aim of extending the concept to around 10 stores by the end of the year. Over the quarter, the streamlining of the store network resulted in the closure of 3 stores and the transfer of 3 owned stores to franchises at Monoprix (16 closures and 3 transfers since the beginning of the year). The brand also opened 8 new outlets during the quarter (19 since the beginning of the year). Franprix The positive impact of the "prix francs” (fair prices) campaign, with price cuts and price freezes on 50 private-label products, and the good performance of stores converted to the "Oxygène" concept, helped to support this trend over the quarter. The concept was extended to a further 25 stores over the quarter, bringing the total number of stores converted to the new concept to 75 at end-September, outperforming the rest of the store network (like-for-like sales growth of +2.3% over the quarter vs. -0.2% for the store network as a whole). Franprix continued to expand its quick meal solutions offer at end-September with the roll-out of two low-cost meal deals (breakfast and lunch).Changes within the Franprix network continued during the quarter with 24 store closures, 5 openings (64 closures, 22 openings and 6 transfers of owned stores to franchises or business leases since the beginning of the year). Casino/Spar/Vival This performance was underpinned by strong momentum in July (+3.6%) and September (+2.0%), ahead of a +0.3% improvement in August. Seasonal stores once again supported the trend this quarter, with a good summer season in the mountains for the Spar and Sherpa stores. Over the quarter, the Casino, Spar and Vival owned stores recorded a -1.2% decline in customer traffic (compared with a -0.2% decline in Q2 and a -2.9% decline in Q1).The roll-out of the "Coeur de Blé" quick meal solutions concept continued with 22 new dedicated outlets opened this quarter (36 at end-September) and 26 more planned by the end of the year. The new Spar "Origines" concept, which saw its first store opening in Luynes (Bouches-du-Rhône) this summer, confirmed the net sales growth prospects. The brand plans to open 4 more new stores by the end of the year, and to accelerate roll-out in 2026.The store network saw 98 stores leave the network in Q3 2025, 37 store openings and 19 transfers from owned stores to franchises (866 exits, 101 openings and 67 transfers to franchises since the beginning of the year). Naturalia This performance was boosted by a good momentum in the organic market, amplified by the effectiveness of in-store initiatives and the ongoing success of the "La Ferme" concept, rolled out in 3 additional stores this quarter (23 stores rolled out at end-September). The momentum of e-commerce sales continued, with +27% growth for the brand’s website, while Naturalia continues to expand its quick commerce business with the expansion of its Uber Eats partnership to 9 new stores over the quarter (47 stores at end-September). The quick meal solutions offer further expanded its roll-out: 3 new stores switched to the organic snacking concept this quarter, bringing the number of stores in the test phase to 9. Naturalia closed 1 store and opened 1 store in Q3 2025 (12 closures, 1 opening and 1 transfer from an owned store to a business lease since the beginning of the year). Cdiscount Driven by the marketing reinvestment plan, brand awareness rose significantly and new customer acquisition accelerated (+41% in Q3 2025 after +37% in H1). Cdiscount net sales fell by -2.9% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting the priority given to profitability through the momentum of the Marketplace and the moderate decline in direct sales. Cdiscount Advertising's momentum (revenues up +7.8%) continued with the launch of a new Retail Media product, “Sponsored Brand Video”. Other and Quatrim OTHER FINANCIAL INDICATORS Free cash flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations Over the first nine months of 2025, free cash flow before financial expenses stood at -€39m (-€48m at end-June), driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments. It therefore improved by +€500m compared with the first nine months of 2024 (-€539m) and by +€347m excluding the repayment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. Liquidity7 at 30 September 2025 At 30 September 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.22bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Covenants Net leverage ratio7 The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The “Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA” ratio stood at 7.68x, below the ratio requirement of 8.34x. The Group states that the EBITDA forecasts for Q4 2025 should ensure compliance with the next test, which will take place on 31 December 2025. HIGHLIGHTS Real estate disposals Quatrim and its subsidiaries disposed of €14m in real estate assets in Q3 2025. On 1 August, the Group repaid €20m of the secured debt carried by Quatrim, enabling reduction of the nominal value of this debt to €198m at 30 September 2025. Assaí procedure Since the press release dated 26 September 2025 concerning the request for provisional measures submitted by Sendas Distribuidora S.A. (see press release), Casino Guichard Perrachon SA and Segisor (collectively "Casino") have had access to the file and Casino has presented its defence to the judge. The proceedings are in progress. Proceedings before the Paris Court Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was referred to the Paris Criminal Court following the preliminary investigation by the Financial Public Prosecutor (Parquet National Financier – PNF) for alleged stock price manipulation and private corruption dating back to 2018 and 2019. The hearing before the Paris Criminal Court took place from 1 to 22 October 2025. The Financial Public Prosecutor requested (i) that Casino Guichard Perrachon be ordered to pay a fine of €75m and (ii) that it be prohibited from making an offer to the public of securities and from having its securities admitted to trading on a regulated market for a period of three years, suspended in its entirety, and that it be subject to a compliance programme supervised by the French Anti-Corruption Agency (Agence Française Anticorruption – AFA). These requisitions do not constitute a court decision and the Financial Public Prosecutor's requests are not binding on the Court. Casino Guichard Perrachon contests the fact that it can be personally accused of an offence and asserts that it did not, in any way, benefit from the alleged events mentioned in this dispute. The Group points out that no provision has been recorded in its financial statements in this respect. Judgement is expected to be handed down on 29 January 2026. Franchising of 27 Monop’ stores The Group announces the franchising of 27 Monop’ stores in Paris and the Île-de-France region as part of the joint venture between Monoprix and the Zouari family (7 stores on 28 October, 11 on 29 October and 9 on 30 October). Refer to press release of 29 April 2025 APPENDICES – STORE NETWORK Store network of continuing operations BL: business lease APPENDICES – ACCOUNTING INFORMATION APPENDICES – GLOSSARY Like-for-like (LFL) growthLike-for-like net sales include e-commerce sales and sales of merchandise excluding fuel from stores open for at least 12 months. The figure is calculated at constant exchange rates, excluding calendar effects and tax. Gross merchandise volume (GMV)For convenience brands, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by all the owned and franchised stores and the e-commerce sites, including VAT. For Cdiscount, gross merchandise volume corresponds to the total value of goods sold by the Cdiscount group’s websites and by independent Marketplace vendors. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense included in trading profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales excluding taxes. Adjusted EBITDA after lease paymentsAdjusted EBITDA after lease payments is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation presented in trading profit less repayments of lease liabilities and net interest paid on lease liabilities. DissynergiesDissynergies on operating costs correspond to the loss of economies of scale previously achieved through the hypermarket and supermarket activities and those of the former Latin American subsidiaries (Exito and GPA), up until their disposal in 2024. These costs, initially presented in the 'Other' segment, have been reallocated to the Group entities concerned as from 1 January 2025, in line with the implementation of shared support services. Free cash flow before/after financial expenses Free cash flow before financial expenses corresponds to cash flow from operating activities as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, less net capex, rental payments subject to restatement in accordance with IFRS 16 and adjusted for the effects related to the strategic disposal plan and the financial restructuring.Free cash flow after financial expenses is calculated by deducting net interest paid from free cash flow before financial expenses, excluding interest on leases restated in accordance with IFRS 16. Covenant – Net leverage ratioThe covenant is defined as the ratio between "covenant net debt" and "covenant adjusted EBITDA". The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not convinced. "This is different," Powell told reporters on Wednesday when asked about applying any lessons from the 1990s dot-com crash to today's AI boom. "If you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [era], these were ideas rather than companies," he added. "So, there's a clear bubble there. Whereas—I won't go into particular [tech company] names—but [today's top performers] actually have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profits. So it's really a different thing." In other words, Powell believes businesses like Amazon, which reported $18 billion in profit last quarter, have ongoing revenue streams to keep the companies afloat, even if their AI ambitions don't pan out. An economic bubble is the "rapid escalation in asset prices, often due to speculative behavior, followed by a sharp contraction," according to Investopedia. They're hard to identify in real-time, but lead to "significant economic consequences" once they burst. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s is one of the most notable examples, along with the Japanese economic contraction in the 1980s, and the Dutch "Tulip Mania" of the 1630s. Today, it's not speculative tulip investments that would bring down the economy, but data centers. The sums of money tech companies are pouring into them are astronomical, suggesting a high level of confidence that has sent stocks soaring. Nvidia just hit the $5 trillion valuation mark. Earlier this year, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank pledged to invest $500 billion in AI data centers over the next four years via their Stargate project. Yesterday, Amazon opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, while Google, Microsoft, Meta, and others have similar plans. Data centers require a small number of employees, but building them generates temporary business for suppliers and construction companies. "The investment we're getting into equipment and all the things that go into creating data centers and feeding AI, it's clearly one of the big sources of growth in the economy," Powell said this week. He admitted he couldn't say if the data center investments "will work out," but does not think they will affect interest rates either way, which is his primary concern. (On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter point.) Still, the AI hype is not translating into a hiring boom. Amazon just laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the need to move fast in AI (and pay for the GPUs needed to power it), which might climb to 30,000 in 2026. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI and poached its founder to lead AI at Meta, but recently laid off 600 employees as part of a team restructuring. When asked about whether AI is contributing to layoffs, Powell said it's too soon to tell, but it's an area the Federal Reserve is concerned about and watching closely. "You see a significant amount of companies announcing that they are not going to be doing much hiring or are actually doing layoffs, and much of the time they are talking about AI and what it can do," he said. "It could absolutely have implications for job creation. We don't see it in the initial [jobless] claims data yet, but it takes some time to get in there. We are watching that very carefully, but don't see it yet." The government shutdown is further hampering efforts to secure the federal employment data report for September. In its absence, Powell referenced "anecdotal data" from earnings reports, where companies are discussing a "bifurcated economy," meaning very different activity among high-income consumers who are still spending a lot, and lower-income consumers who are tightening their belts. "We think there's something there," Powell said. Other data points the Fed is using as a proxy for the official, federal report—such as unemployment insurance claims and job listings on Indeed—show that the situation has been "stable" over the last few weeks, Powell said. Regarding tariffs, which have hit tech companies like Apple, Powell seemed cautiously optimistic. "Higher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation," he said. "A reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation will be relatively short-lived, a one-time shift in the price level. "But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent," he cautioned. "And that is a risk to be assessed and managed. Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem."

Former New World devs could find work at Riot Games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Fantasy MMO New World got the death knell from Amazon this week, as the company announced season 10 would round out updates to the game amid wider layoffs affecting some 14,000 jobs. Players and devs alike are commiserating, and now a co-founder of Riot Games has put out a call for the talent who are seeking their next gig. In the immediate wake of New World being sunsetted, someone tweeted at Marc Merrill, who co-created League of Legends and now serves as co-chair and CPO at Riot, stating that he needs to pick up some of the developers who've been set adrift. "Who are the star devs on the teams?" he says. "We're always on the lookout for S-tier talent who want to take on some of the hardest challenges and solve problems on behalf of the most dedicated players." The person who contacted Merrill states that a "Riot MMO" is a "massive need," likely referring to the online RPG the company announced in 2020. Where that project is remians up in the air, but the staff of New World probably wouldn’t be a bad fit for LoL, the still-upcoming Project F, and whatever else Riot is working on. They have experience handling a massive game through peaks and valleys, responding to the needs and wants of a global fanbase for four years. Who are the star devs on the teams? We’re always on the lookout for S-tier talent who want to take on some of the hardest challenges and solve problems on behalf of the most dedicated players. https://t.co/AeVrJ4UgjLOctober 28, 2025 Game-changing rollouts were part of their regular workload. In fact, the most recent expansion, Nighthaven, helped revive New World and put it on a more positive trajectory, making the recent turn of events even more heartbreaking, especially for players who’d stuck with Aeternum through thick and thin. In Merrill’s replies, Fabrice Condominas, an executive producer at Riot, sent the eyes emoji. With any luck, some of those now needing another opportunity can find one in the annals of Runeterra.

Title: Update on Next Tomb Raider Game Is Surprising Amid Recent News

By Jonathan H. Kantor A new Tomb Raider game that’s in development received a surprising update in October 2025. Since the first Tomb Raider game arrived on the Sega Saturn in 1996, the franchise has been one of the most enduring of the past few decades. There have been multiple titles, many of which have received widespread critical acclaim, and there’s also a feature film franchise and a forthcoming Amazon Prime series starring Sophie Turner. The last mainline Tomb Raider game was Square Enix Europe’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 2018. Since then, a mobile game, two remasters, and a collection have become available, but no new AAA titles have been released. The next game entered development in 2022, and it just received an interesting update. In late October 2025, Amazon announced a mass layoff of 14,000 employees, which had a significant impact on Amazon Game Studios. However, according to Variety, this didn’t derail the development of the next Tomb Raider title. The as-yet untitled game was first announced by Variety in 2022, and while it seemed the game would be on the chopping block, it appears it’s been spared. The same cannot be said of Amazon Games’ previously forthcoming Lord of the Rings MMORPG, which was cancelled. Still, fans of Lara Croft and her adventure game series can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing development continues, though a release date remains elusive as of writing. The next game in the Tomb Raider franchise is being developed by Crystal Dynamics, with Amazon Games set to publish. The game will ultimately be released as a multi-platform title, although details of the story, gameplay, and other elements remain closely guarded secrets. It’s been in development for over three years, so hopefully, it’s nearing completion, but its release window is anyone’s guess. The game is said to continue Lara Croft’s story, set in an environment that rewards players for solving puzzles, creative pathfinding, and overcoming deadly enemies. Crystal Dynamics is developing the game using Unreal Engine 5. From perilous expeditions to adrenaline-filled Trials, Lara Croft is ready for every situation.The @tombraider Collection returns with two new looks: the Iconic Lara Outfit and the Shadow Runner Outfit. Now available (cont) https://t.co/wO5hNvRrr6 pic.twitter.com/wAHQugSlIQ Like other Tomb Raider games, fans can expect a strong, story-driven single-player narrative. Crystal Dynamics previously claimed its game would be transformative, and the developer is excited to team up with Amazon Studios. Following the announcement of mass layoffs at the publisher, which was launched in 2012, it seemed likely that every game currently in development would be terminated. While the layoffs did hit several titles, Tomb Raider and March of Giants, which recently completed its closed alpha, were spared. According to Bloomberg, Amazon Games is restructuring to support its cloud gaming service Luna with a focus on “casual and AI-focused games.” News of Tomb Raider’s survival brings hope to players who’ve longed to return to the familiar and beloved IP since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. That game was successful, and while Crystal Dynamics, then a subsidiary of Square Enix Europe, offered support, it wasn’t a primary developer. The game featured a continued story in Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft on Netflix. Now that the IP has returned to Crystal Dynamics (Now part of Sweden’s Embracer Group), there’s a lot of talent coming from a studio with a longstanding history with the franchise.

Title: Why crypto’s red-hot IPO rally risks grinding to a halt

About us Copy link The long list of crypto companies hitting the open market this year may have just added another name. On Wednesday, Consensys, the creator of the crypto wallet MetaMask, selected Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as underwriters for its upcoming public listing ambitions, Axios reported. Consensys, which was last valued at $7 billion in 2022, would join stablecoin firm Circle, crypto exchange Gemini, and a slew of other crypto companies in entering the public markets this year. “Consensys is constantly exploring opportunities to expand its impact,” a Consensys spokesperson told DL News. They neither denied nor affirmed the reports. Neither investment bank immediately responded to a request for comment. Consensys’ reported move to go public further highlights the wider financial industry’s embrace of digital assets. US President Donald Trump has spent much of his 10 months in office opening the world’s largest economy to digital assets through pro-crypto executive orders, approving landmark stablecoin legislation, and appointing industry-friendly leaders to key agencies. Meanwhile, various Wall Street titans, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have piled into the market with tokenisation offerings and digital dollar products. But given the extensive preparation needed for an initial public offering, during which the company pitches itself to various investment banks, how much longer can the rally really last? “We’ve likely got 12 to 18 months before it tightens as regulatory clarity gives way to new compliance regimes,” Connor Howe, CEO of Enso.Build, told DL News. Howe estimates that Congress has until early next year to pass key market structure legislation before the mid-term elections put a hold on lawmaking. “Consensys is smart to move now, while public markets still reward exposure to crypto infrastructure and speculation,” Howe said. Bryan Trepanier, the founder and president of ODT.inc, suggests the opportunity for a crypto company to go public could last as long as two years. He also points to regulatory uncertainty in the US as a potential cooling factor. But two other key factors are also at play: US monetary policy and continued investor interest in pure-play cryptocurrencies. While the Federal Reserve cut rates on Thursday, the Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear in his speech that a December cut isn’t a given. “If capital markets tighten or there is a severe correction, underwriting appetite for crypto infrastructure could drop off,” Trepanier told DL News. Likewise, if native tokens find utility beyond simple speculation, investors may turn back to cryptocurrencies rather than stocks. “If next-gen protocols launch tokens with real utility in 2026 and 2027, the equity path could start to look outdated,” added Howe.

Title: Google rolls out Android AI-powered features and updates for developers

UPDATED 13:00 EDT / OCTOBER 30 2025 by Kyt Dotson Google LLC’s Android division today announced several artificial intelligence-powered features aimed at Android developers, offering powerful ways to build advanced intelligent apps for mobile and other devices. Among the new features, Android developers can now easily unlock powerful on-device AI with Google Nano, the company’s relatively tiny large language model, and access image generation alongside updates to agentic “vibe coding” capabilities in Android Studio. Android Studio, the official dedicated development environment for Android apps, received updates to its AI agent capabilities using Gemini, Google’s flagship LLM. The recently launched Agent Mode allows developers to describe complex tasks and goals in plain language, which the AI agent plans and then delivers the changes. Google said the agent’s answers and capabilities are now grounded in the most modern development practices, allowing it to cross-reference the latest documentation in real-time. This enables it to upgrade application programming interfaces on the developer’s behalf. Google also unveiled a new project assistant and the ability to bring any LLM to power Android Studio’s AI functionality. Developers will now be able to shape and guide the output from Gemini Nano, a small AI model designed for consumer devices such as smartphones, by passing in any prompt with a new Prompt API, now in early alpha mode. Gemini Nano’s small size makes it suitable for running on-device. This enables developers to build applications that do not need to contact the cloud to perform generative AI operations — enhancing both security and privacy. Kakao used the Prompt API capability to change how its parcel delivery service works by replacing the manual process where users had to copy and paste details into a form with a simple message that requests delivery. The API automatically extracts all the necessary information. This change reduced order completion time by 24% and boosted new user conversion by 45%. Cloud-based AI solutions with Firebase AI Logic, a set of tools and services that allow developers to integrate AI models into their apps, now support image generation models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, also known as Nano Banana, and Imagen, Google’s high-powered professional image generator. Nano Banana offers advanced image creation and editing features, allowing users to select and manipulate specific areas of an image. Imagen delivers mask-based editing where users can block out part of an image and have the model modify it. Google said it plans to release an LLM benchmark in the coming months that will reflect how capable various AI models and providers are for Android development. The benchmark is composed of real-world problems sourced from public GitHub Android repositories. It will have an LLM recreate a pull request, which is then verified by human-authored tests. This will measure how efficient and suitable an LLM is for navigating complex codebases, understand dependencies and solving everyday problems for developers. Google is finalizing the results from the benchmark and will release the results publicly in an attempt to provide clear guidance to developers on current LLM capabilities. In addition to AI updates, Google also noted last week’s launch of the first in a new wave of virtual reality devices using the company’s Android XR operating system. The first device to ship is from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.: the Galaxy XR, a mixed-reality headset built in partnership with Google. Android XR devices ship with Gemini AI capabilities embedded and are designed on top of Android frameworks using Qualcomm Technologies Inc. chipsets. The new device launched with a price tag of $1,799.99. It provides virtual and mixed reality capabilities for work and entertainment. Users can light up virtual workspaces that float in their vision, watch movies on giant virtual screens and play immersive video games that interact with and react to their environment. “With Galaxy XR, Samsung is introducing a brand-new ecosystem of mobile devices,” said Won-Joon Choi, chief operating officer of mobile experience business at Samsung Electronics. Samsung said the Galaxy XR is the first in a long-term journey, with upcoming innovative devices in the pipeline across the full spectrum of form factors, including AI-enabled smart glasses. This puts Samsung in the running against Meta Platforms Inc., which recently debuted Meta Ray-Ban Display, which includes a built-in display on the right lens, and Apple Inc., which reportedly plans to launch augmented reality smart glasses in 2026.

Title: Amazon Is Set To Report Earnings Today. Here's What Investors Should Know

Amazon is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after markets close on Thursday, and all eyes are likely to be on the e-commerce giant’s cloud business. Amazon is expected to report third-quarter revenue of about $178 billion, a 12% increase from last year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Its earnings are expected to increase 10% to $1.57 a share. While Amazon’s e-commerce operation makes up the bulk of its business, investors will be most focused on its AI efforts, represented by cloud revenue and capital expenditures. Amazon’s cloud growth of 17.5% in the second quarter exceeded official expectations, but disappointed Wall Street after two blowout reports from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). On Wednesday, both of those companies again posted cloud revenue well ahead of Wall Street’s estimates, setting another high bar for Amazon to clear. Amazon's array of businesses spans e-commerce, logistics, advertising, cloud computing and more, making its results a partial reflection of the financial health of U.S. consumers and businesses. Its market capitalization—well over $2 trillion as of midday Thursday—makes its stock one of the most influential in the stock market. Investors may also be primed for Amazon to increase its capital expenditures guidance after Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META) did so with their reports Wednesday. Amazon’s second-quarter capex of $32.2 billion was about 25% higher than analysts expected. Wedbush analysts expect Amazon’s full-year capex to total $119 billion, implying growth of about 10% between the first and second halves of this year. “We are constructive on the setup leading into the report given positive commentary around [Amazon Web Services] growth, healthy trends for the core retail business, and strong advertiser demand,” wrote Wedbush analysts in a note late last week. Amazon stock has been the laggard of the Magnificent Seven recently, with shares up just 3% since the start of the year. Concerns about tariffs and lagging cloud growth have weighed on the stock. Some investors see the potential for shares to close the gap with the rest of the Mag 7 after earnings. Options prices on Thursday morning suggest traders expect Amazon stock to move about 6.3% in either direction by end of the week. A move higher off of Wednesday’s closing price would put shares around $244.75, which would be their first all-time high since early February, while an equivalent decline would put the stock at about $216. Wall Street is generally bullish on the outlook for Amazon stock, with all 22 of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha assigning it a “Buy” rating. Their median price target of $270 is nearly 20% above the stock’s intraday price on Thursday. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect analysts’ estimates for Amazon's diluted earnings per share.

Many changes have taken place within Amazon, and some people fear that the development of the next Tomb Raider game will be affected by them. But fortunately, this does not seem to be the case. Thus, these layoffs have particularly affected Amazon's gaming division, with budget cuts for several studios. And this has caused considerable concern among players, who fear that projects currently under development will be canceled. But Steve Boom announced some good news in a note relayed by Game Rant. Amazon is still working on an open-world driving simulator and on March of Giants, which is the first game from Amazon Games Montreal. In addition, the collaboration with Crystal Dynamics continues, reassuring many fans. However, no further information has been revealed about its gameplay or its story, even though many rumors have emerged in recent months. Indeed, while we know that this will be a single-player game and that Unreal Engine 5 will be used, some people believe that it will be an open world, offering many possibilities. But it will be necessary to wait for new information from Crystal Dynamics to confirm these rumors. Not to mention that the decisions made by Amazon in the coming months could change the projects around this game. Game Rant

Title: Jerome Powell says the AI hiring apocalypse is real: ‘Job creation is pretty close to zero’

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell drew a stark picture of a labor market that looks fine on the surface—4.3% unemployment, solid consumer spending—but is quietly losing momentum underneath. Once you adjust for statistical overcounting in the payroll data, he said during a press conference Wednesday following the FOMC meeting, “job creation is pretty close to zero.”He connected that slowdown, at least in part, to what CEOs are now openly telling investors: AI allows them to do more with fewer people. He noted “a significant number of companies” have recently announced layoffs or hiring pauses, with many of them explicitly citing AI as the reason. “Much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s rate-cut decision, warning large employers are signaling they won’t need to add headcount for years. “We’re watching that very carefully,” he added. The comments come as the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75%–4%, citing “downside risks to employment” even as inflation remains elevated. Powell said the U.S. economy is still expanding at a “moderate pace,” even as hiring slows. He described that spending as one of the “big sources of growth in the economy,” driven by companies building data centers and other equipment tied to artificial intelligence. Powell also pushed back on the idea that all that spending is amounting to another speculative bubble. He drew a clear line between today’s surge in capital expenditure and the dot-com era, noting “these companies actually have earnings.” Those projects, he said, aren’t especially sensitive to interest rates, though, since they reflect long-term bets on higher productivity. At the same time, Powell emphasized the boom creates a policy dilemma for the Fed. AI and automation are boosting output, but they’re also allowing companies to do more with fewer workers, leaving the labor market softer, even while GDP stays positive.“We have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment,” he said. “This is a very difficult thing for a central bank, because one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher.” Recent corporate announcements illustrate Powell’s warning. Amazon announced this week it laid off 14,000 middle managers—about 4% of its white-collar workforcein an effort to “remove organizational layers.” The layoffs come amid their rampant investments into AI. Target, Paramount, and other large firms followed with their own cuts. According to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report, U.S. employers have announced nearly 946,000 layoffs so far this year—the highest total since 2020—with more than 17,000 explicitly tied to AI and another 20,000 to automation.“Job creation is very low, and the job-finding rate for people who are unemployed is very low,” Powell said.The phenomenon is so widespread some economists have coined a new term—the “Great Freeze”—to describe the dismal labor market conditions. With unemployment among recent college grads topping 5%—and AI threatening to automate entry-level office jobs—many Gen Z workers are turning to graduate school as a strategic timeout. That awkward balance—strong investment but weak hiring— is now at the center of the Fed’s decision-making. Powell said the economy increasingly resembles a K-shape, with higher-income households and large corporations benefiting from strong stock markets and AI-fueled productivity gains, while lower-income consumers pull back under the weight of rising costs. He pointed to anecdotal reports from major retailers and consumer companies describing a “bifurcated economy,” in which wealthier Americans continue to spend freely but those at the bottom are trading down to cheaper goods. ““Consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said, noting the uneven effects of growth make the Fed’s balancing act even more complicated. “There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell said. “We’re navigating the tension between our employment and inflation goals as carefully as we can.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: AI Layoffs: Why Understanding Intent May Save Your Job

ByJason Snyder, Contributor. The AI layoffs I first wrote about back in February have arrived. Since Meta’s cuts last week, major disruptions have begun across the AI sector, and beyond. Amazon plans to cut about 14,000 corporate roles globally, and as many as 30,000 over time (roughly 10% of its corporate workforce), as part of a restructuring tied to artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Google and other firms are also reorganizing – citing efficiency, focus and alignment with AI strategy. This isn’t just a tech correction. It’s a structural reset. As AI shifts from novelty to infrastructure, the human roles that once defined creativity, strategy and judgment are being automated or absorbed into systems that optimize for speed over understanding. And yet, there’s still one thing machines can’t own: intent, the upstream human signal that gives action purpose. Understanding and articulating intent may soon be the difference between those who shape AI and those replaced by it. The dominant AI players: Meta, Google, OpenAI, Amazon are no longer competing merely on intelligence. They’re competing on possession. Each is building an integrated loop that spans: Distribution once meant where ads were placed. Now it’s where experience is orchestrated. These models don’t just distribute information, they author it. They can create therapy sessions, games, music, fiction, or conversation tailored to a single person. They don’t just engage your mind; they train your emotions. And as they enter the physical world, embodied in robots, vehicles, wearables, and domestic devices, engagement will soon be sensorial, kinetic, and intimate. The system that writes, distributes, and monetizes the experience will also measure how your pulse, posture, or tone responds to it. That’s not an advertising ecosystem. It’s an ecosystem of human behavior. On paper, the job reductions are framed as efficiency moves, reallocating human capital to fund automation and infrastructure. Yet there’s a second-order effect worth noting: historically, waves of mass layoffs often precede efforts that show higher operating margins and signal “discipline” to investors. Meta’s 2025 cost-cutting, alongside its AI push, coincided with a strong share-price run this year. Whether that’s coincidence or choreography, it points to a deeper truth, AI isn’t just reshaping labor; it’s reshaping perception. The narrative of efficiency has become as valuable as efficiency itself. If you can show Wall Street that you’re automating the future, you don’t have to prove it’s working yet. This isn’t just a tech correction, it’s a structural shift. As AI systems evolve from novelty to infrastructure, companies are resetting human-capital priorities, reallocating talent, and signalling that automation plus consolidation is becoming the new baseline. And the significance of this magnitude reaches far beyond engineers and labs, it touches the upstream layers of agency, narrative, design, and human intention. If the roles that once defined value are shrinking, then the only remaining locus of value becomes the channel that can’t be fully automated: the intent behind the action. When the model, the medium, and the market collapse into one stack, autonomy becomes scarce. If the same company owns the intelligence, the infrastructure, and the interface, then creativity, communication, and even emotion occur inside its design space. You may feel free, but you’re acting within pre-optimized constraints. The question isn’t “Can AI replace humans?” It’s subtler: Who decides what we experience, and why? Every major platform is quietly merging its business model with its model of you. As AI systems generate news, entertainment, education, therapy, and commerce, they’re also shaping the frameworks that determine what you see, when you see it, and how you feel about it. The feed has become the factory. When model owners bolt shopping carts onto chatbots and pair inference with advertising, they don’t just mediate attention; they monetize intention. The same engine that recommends your next purchase is learning what persuades you, predicts your emotional triggers, and trains itself to keep you inside the loop. That’s the trap. The user becomes the product, the participant, and the proof of concept. Algorithms already taught us to insulate, to hate, to consume the illusion of choice. Generative AI takes that one step further, it can now manufacture the choice itself. What begins as personalization ends as programming. The danger isn’t that AI will replace your job; it’s that it will replace the space in which decisions, creativity, and dissent once lived. When meaning, money, and motivation all flow through the same systems, we stop being users and start being used. That’s where intent becomes the new field of power, and the last one not yet owned. Intent is the upstream signal, the human why that precedes the algorithmic what. It’s the one variable platforms can’t fully predict or possess. As my friend Mark Masterson, founder of the Bureau of Bad Decisions, put it to me recently as he was preparing for a talk to the Singapore AI Association: It’s a perfect description of the moment we’re in. AI isn’t killing art, design, or innovation, it’s revealing the hollow parts of them. It’s showing us where process replaced purpose, where scale drowned sincerity. When everything can be generated, the only thing that still matters is whether we meant it. Masterson is right. When every platform measures success through engagement, intent is the only metric that can tell us whether that engagement is authentic or automatic. Intent isn’t something brands can own; it’s something they can learn to recognize and measure. It becomes the independent variable of efficacy, a way to assess outcomes outside the black box of model-defined metrics. If a platform tells you a model “works,” it’s grading its own homework. Intent lets you ask a different question: Did this align with human purpose, or merely optimize for platform goals? Intent reframes success as alignment, not amplification. It’s how we separate meaning from manipulation in an environment where the algorithms increasingly speak for us. If intent is the signal, consent is the boundary, the line that defines whether interaction is mutual or extractive. In a world where AI doesn’t just read your words but your tone, gestures, and micro-expressions, consent must evolve from legal checkbox to continuous state. It must become dynamic, not static, an ongoing negotiation of access, data, and emotional bandwidth. Apple’s privacy architecture hints at this shift: it turns consent into a user-level design principle rather than a buried agreement. Likewise, the EU’s emerging AI Act and the proposed “right to explanation” are early attempts to legislate that same principle, the right to know why a model acts on your behalf. Spotify also publishes explanations of how recommendations are generated, another small move toward algorithmic transparency. Consent ensures that participation remains voluntary even as systems grow more persuasive. It re-anchors human agency in a world optimized to remove hesitation. In the frictionless economy, sameness is the side effect. Everything that’s easy begins to look the same because it’s produced by identical optimization logic. Friction, the resistance that slows execution, is what verifies intent. It’s the pause that reveals whether a purpose can withstand pressure. For brands, friction might mean transparency, restraint, or a moment of human intervention that interrupts automation. Those aren’t inefficiencies; they’re signs of integrity. When we remove friction, we don’t just accelerate; we flatten. Some leaders are already redefining what autonomy can look like in an age of consolidation. Brad Jackson, founder and CEO of Out Of Office, is one of them. His platform virtualizes production talent, turning experiential-marketing skills into modular, portable assets rather than static employment roles. Sharing his perspective with me, Jackson said: His model signals a transition: from employment as a fixed position inside a platform-owned stack to employment as a portable expression of human intent. It’s a blueprint for reclaiming control under consolidation. This isn’t poetry, it’s an operating model for the next economy. When platforms own the pipelines of content, commerce, and cognition, the only independent measure of value left is meaning, and meaning requires friction. Leaders who understand this can reclaim autonomy by managing what machines can’t: the why behind every what. 1. Measure intent, not just engagement. Engagement tells you what happened; intent tells you why. Track upstream indicators, search phrasing, timing, tone, motivation, to gauge whether behavior aligns with purpose. When a platform hands you engagement metrics, ask for intent metrics instead. 2. Design for productive friction. Frictionless systems scale fast but flatten everything they touch. The right amount of resistance creates reflection, a moment when a user chooses instead of drifting. In commerce, that might mean a confirmation step that clarifies consent; in storytelling, a pause that deepens connection. Friction turns participation into intention. 3. Treat consent as a continuous dialogue. Consent isn’t a checkbox; it’s a conversation. Every data exchange, recommendation, or model-driven touchpoint should make choice visible. Apple’s privacy prompts and Spotify’s algorithmic transparency are small but powerful examples of consent-by-design. 4. Build your own validation layer. Don’t let the platform grade its own homework. Create independent measures of success, qualitative feedback, narrative alignment, employee sentiment, that test whether technology is amplifying your intent or replacing it. Friction isn’t failure; it’s a diagnostic for authenticity. 5. Reinvest in the human interface. As AI takes over execution, value shifts to presence: empathy, creativity, and judgment. Brands that invest in conversation, care, and curiosity will stand out amid perfect automation. When every system is engineered to erase hesitation, the leaders who can pause, reflect, and act with intent will define the next era of intelligence. AI’s consolidation signals the end of technical differentiation but the beginning of philosophical differentiation. The next competitive frontier won’t be who trains the biggest model; it will be who defines the clearest why. Brands, creators, and institutions that thrive will measure not just engagement but alignment, the resonance between human intent and machine output. They’ll design consent architectures that make participation explicit. And they’ll use friction strategically, as the necessary resistance that proves authenticity. In the coming years, as generative systems evolve from companions to collaborators to co-inhabitants, teaching, healing, building, touching, the challenge won’t be how fast AI can think. It will be how faithfully it reflects what humans mean. Because when the models own the engines, the platforms, and the distribution, and soon the gestures, the voices, and the gaze, the only remaining space for human agency is before the prompt. That’s the moment of intent. And that’s where meaning, freedom, and identity still belong to us, Some thinkers are already working to rebuild the relationship between people and the systems that shape their lives. Joe Woof, co-lead of the Addiction Economy project and founder of Society Inside, is one of them. His work focuses on redesigning technology and policy frameworks so that social systems and data systems evolve together, accountable to human purpose rather than platform growth. As Woof told me, the problem runs deeper than technology: Woof’s warning reframes the stakes: this isn’t just about ethics, it’s about public health, trust, and long-term business survival. Protecting human intent isn’t simply the right thing to do; it’s the durable thing to do. Systems that honor agency and consent outperform over time because people trust them. They attract loyalty, repeat use, and genuine advocacy, the very qualities algorithms still can’t manufacture. When people feel seen rather than scanned, they stay. In capital markets, authenticity scales faster than optimization because it compounds: customers return, employees engage, and regulators back off. The same principle applies to any business that relies on data or creativity, when individuals understand how and why their participation matters, they participate more fully. Woof’s vision mirrors the argument running through this piece: intent shouldn’t just guide individuals, it should be embedded in institutions. As AI centralizes intelligence and distribution, Society Inside reminds us that true innovation is not only technical but relational, building ecosystems where choice, consent, and shared intent become competitive advantages. The workers most at risk in this wave aren’t simply those with outdated skills, they’re the ones whose work has been stripped of visible intent. AI can replicate tasks, but it can’t replicate why you do them. For many people, that “why” has been buried under bureaucracy or burnout, not lost through laziness. Understanding intent isn’t about individual heroism; it’s about rediscovering the purpose that technology can’t code. When your daily output connects to judgment, empathy, synthesis, or creative intuition, qualities no model can truly imitate, you become harder to replace. Seeing your own intent clarifies where you add meaning. It turns you from an executor into an architect, someone shaping outcomes, not just performing them. We can’t control the speed of automation or the AI layoffs that follow, but we can control how clearly we act with intent. Those who do will shape the next chapter instead of being written out of it.

JPMorgan said Thursday it had debuted a new blockchain-based tool that streamlines distribution and servicing of alternative investment funds as the bank pushes deeper into tokenization. The platform, dubbed Kinexys Fund Flow and developed by the bank's digital asset arm Kinexys by JPMorgan, aims to give fund managers, transfer agents and distributors a shared, real-time view of investor activity while reducing manual reconciliation and cutting delays in capital movement. The first live transaction with the tool involved multiple J.P. Morgan business lines: Asset Management, the Private Bank and Kinexys Digital Assets. Fund administrator Citco also participated. This is the latest step in JPMorgan’s broader push to apply blockchain tech and tokenization for traditional finance, a trend that's gaining traction among major financial institutions. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens. The bank plans a broader rollout of Kynexis Fund Flow in early next year, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

Google’s YouTube is restructuring its products team in a major shift towards AI, offering voluntary buyout packages with severance to its U.S.-based employees. CNBC reports that YouTube, Google’s online video platform that has been a staple of the internet since its launch in 2005, is undergoing a significant staffing shakeup as the company pivots to focus on AI. According to an internal memo from YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, the company is restructuring its products team for the first time in a decade, a move that comes as parent company Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai has urged staff to embrace AI for increased productivity. As part of the restructuring process, YouTube is offering its U.S.-based employees voluntary buyout packages that include severance pay. This decision follows a growing trend among tech giants, such as Amazon, which recently announced layoffs of 14,000 employees as the company also embraces AI. A YouTube spokesperson stated, “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI,” claiming that no roles are being eliminated with the restructure, despite buyouts being offered to staff. Instead, the company aims to reorganize its teams to better align with its AI-driven future. The move towards AI is not unique to YouTube and Amazon. Many tech companies are recognizing the transformative potential of this technology, with some even calling it the most significant advancement since the advent of the internet. However, this shift has also raised concerns about the impact on the workforce, as evidenced by the layoffs and restructuring at various tech giants. In a memo shared publicly, Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said, “The world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Read more at CNBC here.

Title: Alphabet Stock Hits Record High After Google Parent Reports Strong Earnings—Monitor These Key Levels

Alphabet (GOOGL) shares jumped to a record high Thursday after the Google parent reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, as quarterly revenue surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The tech giant’s top line received a boost in the third quarter from Google Cloud posting a 34% jump in revenue from a year earlier, as Alphabet customers invest billions expanding their AI infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. Meanwhile, revenue in the company’s legacy advertising business grew 13% in the period, signaling that the digital ad market remains stable amid economic uncertainty and increasing competition. The company also raised its capital expenditure spending forecast for the year to between $91 billion to $93 billion, citing booming AI demand. Alphabet shares were up nearly 5% at around $288 in recent trading and have now gained more than 50% since the start of 2025, making it the top-performing Magnificent Seven-member stock this year, slightly ahead of AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Investors have cheered the company’s accelerating growth in AI and cloud, resilience in its advertising business, and an antitrust win that allowed it to retain its Chrome browser. Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Alphabet shares broke out from a flag pattern earlier this month, indicating a continuation of the stock’s strong uptrend. It’s worth pointing out that while the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, the indicator sits in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of near-term profit-taking or consolidation. Let’s use the measuring principle to forecast a potential upside target on Alphabet’s chart if the shares continue to rally and also identify two major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns. Investors can forecast a bullish upside target by applying the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes a stock's prior moves to project its next potential advance. When applying the study to Alphabet’s chart, we calculate the distance in points of the strong trend higher that preceded the flag and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $115 to $245, which forecasts a target of $360. During downturns, investors should initially monitor the $235 level. Traders who avoid chasing breakouts may wait for retracements to the base of the flag pattern, which also coincides with a wide-ranging day on the chart in early September. Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares revisit lower support around $205. This area on the chart, currently situated just above the rising 50-week moving average, may attract buying interest near the stock’s prominent January swing high.

Title: Meta Platforms Enters Oversold Territory

ByDividend Channel, Contributor. The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Meta Platforms presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors. 10 Oversold Dividend Stocks » But making Meta Platforms Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of META entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $650.17 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Meta Platforms Inc, the RSI reading has hit 26.1 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 47.2. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, META's recent annualized dividend of 2.1/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 0.28% based upon the recent $751.67 share price. A bullish investor could look at META's 26.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on META is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amazon's latest quarterly earnings report could answer one of Wall Street's biggest questions: Is the company cutting jobs because growth is stalling, or is the retail giant's big bet on AI making it more efficient? First scenario: The company announced 14,000 layoffs earlier this week because it's worried about its performance and wants to cut costs. Second scenario: The tech giant has become so great at artificial intelligence that its operations are becoming way more efficient, and it doesn't need as many employees now. The results, and a conference call with analysts, should shed light on this. Of course, the reality could be a combination of these two scenarios or something entirely different. When Amazon reports, there's also one particular number to watch: revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud business. For the third quarter, Wall Street expects AWS revenue to reach $32.4 billion, representing an 18% year-over-year increase, according to RBC Capital. Microsoft reported on Wednesday that Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 40%, and Google Cloud grew 34%. Google executives revealed on the company's Wednesday earnings call that Google Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined. These numbers are not always strictly comparable with AWS, but that's still very fast growth to compete with. If AWS growth exceeds expectations, that will likely be a relief for investors and could hint that scenario 2 is in play: AI transformation is taking hold, both for Amazon and its cloud customers. If AWS revenue misses that 18% growth number, then Wall Street will probably worry more, and the first scenario could kick in: Those job cuts could be a defensive move. Some analysts have been worried about AWS's lagging growth rate for at least a year. The company was a pioneer in the cloud, but AI is changing the market and giving rivals a new way to compete. Still, AWS remains the dominant player here, and it has promising opportunities, including a successful partnership with AI lab Anthropic. AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC on Wednesday that the company feels "quite good" about its massive AI investments. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here.

Title: New Lord of the Rings MMORPG Apparently Cancelled

By Jonathan H. Kantor A Lord of the Rings MMORPG that’s been in development since early 2023 has apparently been cancelled. The expansive franchise based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s beloved novels has included several previous titles, many of which are highly regarded by the gaming community. The last time fans got to enjoy an MMORPG based on the novels came in 2007 with the release of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment’s The Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s considerably old compared to modern fare. Fans were eagerly anticipating a return to Middle-earth in an all-new, contemporary take on the franchise, but the game’s development ceased in October 2025. According to Bloomberg, Amazon began laying off 14,000 people in late October 2025, resulting in a significant reduction in personnel working at Amazon Games, which was publishing the MMORPG. While it wasn’t clear which divisions would take the brunt of the cuts, Ashleigh Amrine, a former Senior Gameplay Engineer at Amazon Games, revealed on LinkedIn that she was among the 14,000 cut, and the Lord of the Rings MMORPG was no longer in development. She included a note, adding, “Y’all would have loved it,” which seems likely given the amount of time, talent, and money that was previously attached. Amazon Games has been around since 2012, and it’s focused on publishing new content since its inception. That strategy appears to have shifted with the latest round of layoffs, which Amazon noted in a memo released on October 28, 2025, included “significant role reductions” at Amazon Games. The company is shifting its focus to its cloud gaming service Luna, which primarily serves as a TV-based platform for launching pre-existing titles. While The Lord of the Rings MMORPG is dead, Amazon Games will continue to develop and release March of Giants, a new Tomb Raider game, and “casual and AI-focused games.” In addition to the loss of employment for thousands of developers, the layoffs and subsequent cancelling of the MMORPG is a blow to gamers everywhere. Since Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring hit theaters in 2001, gamers have had access to a plethora of titles based on the franchise. There are plenty of older Lord of the Rings games that still hold up, but the loss of the forthcoming MMORPG is a significant blow to the community. While few details of the now-cancelled game were released, it would have been set in a persistent, open-world Middle-earth, drawing inspiration from the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings literary trilogies. Not only does the cancellation hurt longtime fans of the franchise, but it also represents a missed opportunity. Another Amazon product, its exceptionally expensive The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power streaming series, could have also been incorporated into the game. This would have significantly expanded the storyline to before the Third Age, when Sauron and his power are finally destroyed after the One Ring is thrown into the fires of Mount Doom. Even if players weren’t enamored with the series, its inclusion would have meant more expansive playtime, but now that it’s dead, it could be years before another studio attempts to develop a Lord of the Rings MMORPG.

Title: WisdomTree Debuts 14 Tokenized Funds on Plume Network
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/30/wisdomtree-launches-14-tokenized-funds-on-plume-network
Time Published: 2025-10-30T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Asset manager WisdomTree has debuted 14 tokenized funds on Plume, a blockchain designed for real-world asset (RWA) finance, expanding access for institutional investors to regulated on-chain investment products. The funds, available through WisdomTree Connect, include the firm’s Government Money Market Digital Fund and CRDT Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund, allowing investors to hold, transfer, and settle positions directly on Plume’s blockchain network, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. The listings are part of WisdomTree’s multi-chain strategy to make its regulated products accessible across multiple blockchains. As part of the rollout, Galaxy Digital said it will allocate $10 million to WisdomTree’s Government Money Market Digital Fund, underscoring early institutional participation. “WisdomTree’s tokenized funds exemplify how regulated products can thrive in a compliant, permissionless environment,” Luke Xiao, head of partnerships at Plume, said in Thursday's announcement. Unlike general-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum or Polygon, Plume integrates KYC and AML compliance directly at the protocol level, offering built-in safeguards such as wallet screening and sanctions enforcement. Plume, which recently won registration as a transfer agent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claims more than 276,000 RWA holders and about $600 million in tokenized assets, making it the largest blockchain by RWA participants. For WisdomTree, the move extends its onchain footprint beyond Ethereum and Stellar. The company, which manages over $100 billion in traditional assets, has about $650 million in tokenized assets under management. Its digital funds are SEC-registered 1940 Act products, allowing onchain transfers between verified wallets via soulbound NFTs that maintain AML and KYC controls. “By adding Plume, investors gain access to diversified tokenized fund strategies and more efficient settlement, while maintaining compliance standards,” said Maredith Hannon, Head of Business Development for Digital Assets at WisdomTree. The partnership also underscores growing competition among asset managers – alongside Franklin Templeton and BlackRock – to bring regulated investment vehicles onchain, as institutions explore blockchain’s potential to streamline operations and open new channels for distribution and liquidity.

Title: Did Amazon Just Kill Its Lord Of The Rings MMO?

Morning Checkpoint Is the Switch 2 doomed to be a physical graveyard of third-party game key cards? Why are so many new special edition controllers so ugly? And has Amazon really pulled the plug on its fledgling Lord of the Rings MMO? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint,Â Kotaku‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I don’t need any more gaming devices in my life but I’m obsessed with the latest batch of DS knock-offs out of China. Nintendo is really leaving money on the table by not shipping its own legacy handhelds. I mean, people were so desperate for a new Game Boy they hacked the Lego one so it could run games. Resident Evil Requiem gets a special Switch 2 Pro controller and amiibo www.vooks.net/reside… — Vooks (@vooks.net) 2025-10-29T22:58:16.000Z It’s the same dark shade as the normal Pro controller but with graphics from an in-game newspaper over the front. The words Resident Evil are also there but largely interrupted by the central Switch 2 logo. Truly a bummer. In other bad news, the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed to be a game key card. Rip. As spotted by Rock, Paper, Shotgun, developer Ashleigh Amrine made a now-deleted post on LinkedIn about the layoffs that hinted at the game no longer being in production. “This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers onÂ New WorldÂ and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),” sheÂ wrote. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about whether the project has been killed. It’s always possible the company is still still looking to offload the project or just license it out to another studio. If that game ever does come to market, however, it’ll probably bare no relation to whatever early prototype the New World devs were working on. Microsoft announced its second quarter earnings yesterday. While Azure cloud services and its AI gambles continue to pay off, the gaming division actually shrunk. Xbox gaming revenues were down $113 million with already terrible hardware numbers down 29 percent year over year. It’s worth noting that this was the same quarter when Microsoft jacked up the Xbox Series X/S consoles to $400 and $600 respectively due to Trump’s trade war. Somehow I don’t think a more expensive PC-like next-gen console with no exclusives will turn that around.

It also addresses a ton of crashes and bugs. Enough to turn around initially grim sentiments on the messy vampire RPG? Perhaps not. But bigger-ticket changes like FOV sliders and better saving options are on the docket for upcoming patches. That’s according to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick who happens to oversee some of the biggest and most critically acclaimed franchises in the world with Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and BioShock. He said AI is currently incapable of making the GTA 6 marketing plan, let alone an entire game. And even if it could, he doesn’t think it would be any good. âAnything that involves backward-looking data compute, itâs really good for that and that applies to lots of things,â he told CNBC. âWhat we do at Take-Two, anything that isnât attached to that, itâs going to be really, really bad at.â Plus, he admits, it’s a legal minefield. Former Konami executive Christopher Bergstresser recently revealed that the Wachowskis had approached the Japanese publisher about recruiting Hideo Kojima to make a Matrix video game back in 1999. “In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place,” Kojima shared on X in response. I could be projecting but the admission seemed tinge with sadness and a slight sense of betrayal. “At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldnât have accepted the offer right away,” the Death Stranding director concluded. “But if someone had told me, maybe there couldâve been a way to make it work.” fucking insanity man. pic.twitter.com/LITLrLyKzu — Seriously (@seriouslyjokinn) October 29, 2025 Donât miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Title: Big Employers Using AI to Decimate White Collar Jobs; What Happens When Real Incomes, Employment, and Social Compact Erode?

Seemmingly contradictory processes are at work. We may have reached peak AI, at least in terms of growth of use of the seemingly dominant type, large language models, which are conflated with “generative AI” (sticklers are encouraged to clear up fine points in comments). Several key growth measures are stalling out or even falling. Yet a wave of igh profile employers like Amazon, UPS, and Walmart announcing of big headcount cuts, citing AI implementation as the driver of the firings, says AI uptake is gaining steam. What gives? And more important, even if AI is not performing all that well in terms of accuracy and reliabilty, that may not matter much as long as it is (barely) good enough to corporate executives to screw down furhter on workers, here in comparatively well-paid white collar roles, to the benefit of their bonuses and shareholders. While an AI bubble crash (and accompanying reports of AI not living up to its promise) may put this trend on pause or even in reverse, if this trend continues at its current pace and intensity, it will further damage the career and income prospects of college educated workers, most of all recent graduates, so as to be counter-revolutionary. It will upend the heretofore tacitly accepted responsiblity of governments and the managerial classes to provide for an adequate level of employment and social safety nets in a system that requires most of the population to sell its labor as a condition of survival. It will also reverse the virtous circle created by Henry Ford1 of giving workers steady enough jobs at high enough pay levels that they could afford to buy the new products made possible by widespread electrification and the mass uptake of automobiles….including in due course suburban homes. And it will further erode class mobilty, aka The American Dream. The further thinning of the already increasingly precarious middle class will also greatly weaken social stability, particularly at a time when social safety nets are being gutted. Go long bodyguard services. While we don’t have definitive answers on what is happening in Corporate America, particularly given the diversity of the perps, at least one motivation is to take advantage of the AI mania, still very much alive in the markets, and goose the stock by wrapping what is largely good old fashioned work force squeezing/process re-engineering in the AI mantle (although CEOs are going to some lengths to depict AI implementations as pervasive). We may get a better grip on what is happening internally in the coming months. On the one hand, a well-publicized MIT study found that 95% of corporate pilots of AI did not pan out. On the other hand, there are more and more breathless stories of big employers and professional services firms reducing hiring, particularly of newbies, and even, slashing white collar staff levels. So is the way to square this circle that AI actually does not perform well, save as a weapon in class warfare? The Corporate AI Firing Frenzy Before unpacking the implications in more detail, let’s first look at the apparent magnitude of this trend. We’ve reported before that company leaders, in a sharp departure from historical practice, are touting running their companies with fewer warm bodies. This pursuit of corporate anexoria is long-standing (and extends to capex); we described it in 2005 in a Conference Review Board article, The Incredible Shrinking Corporation. The Wall Street Journal reported on this new enthusism in June and affirmed by Chief Executive Council: In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, it’s no longer rare to hear leaders celebrate layoffs as a badge of honor. CEOs are openly touting staff reductions; not as last-resort damage control, but as strategic wins. Companies are embracing workforce slimming as a deliberate tactic to prop up profitability and signal AI-readiness to investors. As reported by Wall Street Journal by Chip Cutter on June 27th, 2025. CEOs Are Shrinking Their Workforces—and They Couldn’t Be Prouder Big companies are getting smaller—and their CEOs want everyone to know it. The careful, coded corporate language executives once used in describing staff cuts is giving way to blunt boasts about ever-shrinking workforces. Gone are the days when trimming head count signaled retrenchment or trouble. Bosses are showing off to Wall Street that they are embracing artificial intelligence and serious about becoming lean. After all, it is no easy feat to cut head count for 20 consecutive quarters, an accomplishment Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer touted this month. The bank is using attrition “as our friend,” Charlie Scharf said on the bank’s quarterly earnings call as he told investors that its head count had fallen every quarter over the past five years—by a total of 23% over the period. Loomis, the Swedish cash-handling company, said it is managing to grow while reducing the number of employees, while Union Pacific, the rail operator, said its labor productivity had reached a record quarterly high as its staff size shrank by 3%. Last week, Verizon’s CEO told investors that the company had been “very, very good” on head count. Translation? “It’s going down all the time,” Verizon’s Hans Vestberg said. The shift reflects a cooling labor market, in which bosses are gaining an ever-stronger upper hand, and a new mindset on how best to run a company. Pointing to startups that command millions of dollars in revenue with only a handful of employees, many executives see large workforces as an impediment, not an asset, according to management specialists. Some are taking their cues from companies such as Amazon.com, which recently told staff that AI would likely lead to a smaller workforce. A new Wall Street Journal article recaps some of the recent headcount cuts, with Amazon layoff of 14,000 (initially mis-reported by Reuters as 30,000) driving a new set of press sightings: The nation’s largest employers have a new message for office workers: help not wanted. Amazon.com said this week that it would cut 14,000 corporate jobs, with plans to eliminate as much as 10% of its white-collar workforce eventually. United Parcel Service UPS 1.14%increase; green up pointing triangle said Tuesday that it had reduced its management workforce by about 14,000 positions over the past 22 months, days after the retailer Target said it would cut 1,800 corporate roles. Earlier in October, white-collar workers from companies including Rivian Automotive, Molson Coors TAP -2.43%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Motors received pink slips—or learned that they would come soon. Added up, tens of thousands of newly laid off white-collar workers in America are entering a stagnant job market with seemingly no place for them… A leaner new normal for employment in the U.S. is emerging. Large employers are retrenching, making deep cuts to white-collar positions and leaving fewer opportunities for experienced and new workers who had counted on well-paying office work to support families and fund retirements. Nearly two million people in the U.S. have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, according to recent federal data. Behind the wave of white-collar layoffs, in part, is the embrace by companies of artificial intelligence, which executives hope can handle more of the work that well-compensated white-collar workers have been doing. Investors have pushed the C-suite to work more efficiently with fewer employees. Factors driving slower hiring include political uncertainty and higher costs. Altogether, these factors are remaking what office work looks like in the U.S., leaving the managers that remain with more workers to supervise and less time to meet with them, while saddling the employees fortunate enough to have jobs with heavier workloads. The cascade of restructurings has created a precarious feeling for managers and staff alike. It is also tightening the options for those who are looking for employment. Around 20% of Americans surveyed by WSJ-NORC this year said they were very or extremely confident that they could find a good job if they wanted to, lower than in past years. Mind you, this is not the first time we have seen this movie, but this time, the production promises to be on an unprecedented scale. For instance, tarting in the 1980s, big companies started greatly thinning their corporate centers. The leveraged buyout wave precipitated this shift. Raiders targeted over-diversified conglomerates, which tended to be over-manned at their head offices, breaking them up and reducing need for big bureaucracies to ride herd on the operations. Many companies greatly trimmed the size of these activites to make themselves less attractive as prey. The rise of personal computers and improved management information systems facilitated this shift. It also became common simply to fire managers and require the survivors to do what had formerly been one and a half or even two jobs. Similarly, the outsourcing of tech jobs to foreign body shops and H1-B holders may not have reduced headcounts overall (Robert Cringley claims total manning increased) but did make it well-nigh impossible to land an entry level job in software at large companies, as over two decades of frustrated new graduates seeking advice at Slashdot attests. For another summary (with a preview of broader implications, which we’ll discuss later), see this Breaking Points segment: Signs of Weakening AI Demand Due Given all the wonderous things AI is supposedly able to do, a slackening of demand would seem to reflect performance shortfalls. Admittedly these data points are indicative as opposed to dispositive: Hartley, Jolevski, Melo, and Moore have been tracking GenAI use for Americans at work since December 2024. They find that GenAI use fell to 36.7% of survey respondents in September 2025 from 45.6% in June. I wonder if OpenAI, Google or Anthropic are seeing a similar decline… https://t.co/hjnss5u6vj — Erik Brynjolfsson (@erikbryn) October 22, 2025 A must-read post by Gary Marcus contains more contra-hype signtings. For instance: 3. This also fits with this graph from Apollo Global Management’s Chief Economist Torsten Slok, based on Census Data, from early September: 4. TechCrunch just reported that “ChatGPT’s mobile app is seeing slowing download growth and daily use” based on data from Apptopia Even with these signs of more and more dogs rejecting the AI dogfood, the C Suite is still heavily populated with true believers. As we indicated above, AI might not have to work well to suit their purposes. In most types of goods and services, crapification has become the norm. Customer service and product qualty too often stink. So the top brass may feel, particularly in a world of too many big incumbents (as in few alternative providers), that they can degrade their offerings further at no/minimal risk. What Happens as the Gutting of the Middle Class Accelerates? Cynics might point out that office workers are finally being hosit on their own petard. They participate in, or at least did not object to, the outsourcing and offshoring of US jobs. We have pointed out that in many, arguably most, the business case was weak, even before factoring in the increase in risk due to greater complexity and dependence on outside contractors. But it made perfect sense if you viewed outsourcing as mainly intended to increase the pay and authority of executives and middle managers at the expense of hourly/lower level workers. One of the big rationalizations of the AI boom, from an economic perspective, is that the implementation of new technology increases prosperity on a broad basis. Aside from ignoring externalities like pollution and the fact that these big changes produce winners and losers, and the winners seldom ameliorate the damage done to the losers, the idea that incomes rise isn’t even always true. The Industrial Revolution in England ushered in at least a generation (and according to some studies two generations) of declining living standards. Victorian workhouses were one indicator of how bad conditions became for those in the lower orders who failed to find employment. In Europe, living standards have already been falling due to the sanctions-induced energy shock producing de-industrialization, as in job losses and pay cuts, in tandem with higher consumer power costs and often increased food expenses due to climate change reducing agricultural output. And that’s before getting to reductions in social safety nets due to falling tax revenues (see Russia sanctions blowback), turbo-charged by commitments to militarize even as the US trade wars are adding to economic damage. In the US, while power costs are not dire (although the AI is increasing electrical bills and more is in the offing), food, housing, and medical expenses are high and generally rising. And tariff costs are kicking in as many producers have exhausted inventories stockpiled before Liberation Day. A new Financial Times story confirms that the young, traditionally the most employable, are hardest hit: Income growth in the US has slowed to a near-decade low, with young workers especially hard hit, in a sign American consumers are struggling with a weakening labour market and persistent inflation. Real income growth for workers aged between 25 and 54 this year dropped to its slowest pace — excluding periods of pandemic volatility — since the 2010s when the 2008 financial crisis led to high levels of unemployment, according to new research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The slowdown is the latest sign of an increasingly distressed US labour market, and comes as Federal Reserve officials are expected to cut rates on Wednesday. George Eckerd, co-author of the report, told the Financial Times: “We’re looking at a level of year-on-year growth that’s actually similar to [the 2010s] when the labour market was a lot weaker and the unemployment rate was higher.” “Inflation is eating into otherwise decent levels of pay gains,” he added. Keep in mind that the measure of inflation impacts the real income computation. Most experts consider inflation to be understated; measurement have been repeatedly jiggered to produce lower results so as to reduce the disbursements for cost-of-living adjustments, as well as for political purposes. So a higher inflation figure would lower the level of real income, and probably push the claimed growth into contraction, consistent with the lived experience of most Americans. There are big implications if the US middle class suffers a big leg down in its size and health. For starters, many, particularly the young, took on student debt to go to college and get a “good” job. But employers are now playing musical chairs, except they suddenly removed all the seats save one. What happens when even more fall behind on payments and are hit with penalty interest rates? And even putting aside the pernicious effect of student debt, young adults with low and erratic incomes means more living with parents, less household formation (econ speak for getting married and having kids), less home buying. The much-lowered value of a college degree will blow back to universities in terms of less competition for admission, save at the very top schools, and likely lower enrollment overall. If more parents are telling their kids to become plunbers or painting contractors or HVAC techs, that will also somewhat unwind the Elizabeth Warren “two income trap” phenomenon of parents bidding up housing in school districts seen as being advantaged in college admissions terms. In the modern era, in societies that do not have religions that justify yawning class/income differences, a combination of rising income levels, the perception of elite comptence, which includes at least some concern for the welfare of the lower orders, and class mobility have been the bulwark of legitimacy. All these pillars are crumbing in the US. In the Breaking Points segment above, Saagar Enjeti suggested that the AI revolution, if it lives up to its hype, could foment an actual revolution by producing two conditons considered to be key to the Russian revolution: declining living standards and elite overproduction. Based on the flaccidness of the No Kings protests, which had significant middle/upper middle class representation, I don’t see it. The impediements include atomization and weak social ties, the perception that protests with muscle (as that entail a real risk of police thuggery in response) are the province of losers like union workers (and there is also perilous little knowledge what early labor protestors endured to secure basic workplace protections). More practically, in our high survellance/recordkeeping state, organizing and participating in demonstrations, or worse, being arrested, is sure to be a job prospect killer. So many of the newly-downtrodden quite rationally may conclude that they can’t afford to take a personal stand. As for elite overproduction being a factor that will amplify protest, given the lack of competence of our elite incumbents, yours truly is not optimistic that those who put themselves on education tracks for those roles are any more able to manage their way out of a paper bag….or organize a revolt. Again, to use the analogy of the early Industrial Revolution, the enclosure movement, which shifted formerly self-sufficient farmers to factories and cities, did produce William Blake’s “dark Satanic mills” and the eventual 1848 revolts across Europe. However, depending on which historian you believe, that upheaval was either ineffective or produced only some concessions from the ruling classes in terms of improved social protections. But it did not upend the existing order. That is not to say some sort of dislocation of the existing order is not baked in. But I don’t see it as being something as Manichean or potentially decisive as a revolution. If not a full-bore Jackpot, it’s likely to have an anachic flavor of a big increase in dysfunction, disorder, and desperation. _____ 1 This move was not altruistic, as some like to pretend. Ford found it hard to find and keep assembly line workers. The jobs still required training yet were tedious and restrictive. Ford found he had to pay his men well in order to have his factories operate on a high uptime basis. But his and other carmakers hiring (on similar employment terms) was on such a scale as to create a massive pool of blue collar elite that could afford to buy cars. To be fair, the corporate hiring frenzy during the pandemic was too much. They could be cutting jobs and just putting AI into their announcements so Wallstreet loves them more. Also, if you look at FRED data, median household income has been flat since 2020. The big gains were in the last Trump admin and the end of the Obama administration. So at the median its been no gain for about five years. In IT I think this is most of the story, and may even be most of it. The factors seem to be: – reverse to the mean after the pandemic hiring. – responding to a general slowdown in the economy. – the collapse of the VC ‘app’ economy. AI is in the mix, but IT is a hype driven industry. There’s always some stupidity complicating hiring. AI seems more like an excuse for lowering the cost of wages, not so much the head count: “Amazon perhaps faces the most scrutiny. US Citizenship and Immigration Services data showed that Amazon sponsored the most H-1B visas in 2024 at 14,000, compared to other criticized firms like Microsoft and Meta, which each sponsored 5,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. Senators alleged that Amazon blamed layoffs of ‘tens of thousands’ on the ‘adoption of generative AI tools,’ then hired more than 10,000 foreign H-1B employees in 2025.” https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ If you see a recession coming, you can blame AI for the layoffs, and look like a successful innovator rather than a struggling business. There are actually two AI technologies in play, and while they’re related, they have important differences. One is LLMs/generative models (same thing essentially), the other is Machine Learning. While Machine Learning has been massively over hyped, it is still very useful and has many practical purposes. China is investing heavily in this, and its strengths are in control engineering such as industrial processes, logistics and complex engineering. It has limitations (self-driving cars are probably impossible), is not intelligent, requires a ton of training, but used appropriately is very powerful. LLMs are really just smart text complete. They’re very good at spotting patterns, and then creating facsimiles of those patterns (forgeries essentially). But they’re limited by their training data (which by necessity must be incomplete), complexity (which means above a certain point they require huge amounts of energy and time, for diminishing returns – and there’s not much to be done about that) and the accuracy of those training them (underpaid graduates in the Philippines and Eastern Europe – best I can tell). This makes LLMs good for repetitive office jobs, where accuracy isn’t critical, the outputs don’t vary significantly and where the cost of the work justifies a couple of nuclear power stations. That stuff exists (marketing, a lot of low level translation stuff), but its a comparatively small market. For programming, even if this tech works (and it doesn’t really), the cost of the tools for a single developer are going to be more than that developer’s salary, for output that’s essentially similar to a mediocre intern and you still need that developer to supervise. The economics just don’t add up once the VC subsidies disappear. This makes Uber look sane. Following up on this, a couple of additional points > Even with these signs of more and more dogs rejecting the AI dogfood, the C Suite is still heavily populated with true believers. I think it’s always important to remember that many members of the C Suite are not terribly bright and have only a limited understanding of what is happening on the shop floor. They also tend to be terrible with technology – even CIOs, at least in my experience, do not actually know much about IT. They will go to conferences aimed at CIOs, listen to podcasts and read the media selling stuff to them. And then cravenly try to do what everyone else is doing, so even if they fail (and the majority of IT projects fail), they can point to ‘industry trends’. When it comes to technology, the corporate class are sheep. Nobody wants to be the odd guy out. Senior execs, even at places at Amazon, tend to be bad at identifying which jobs matter. For years corporate America has been dreaming of eliminating their IT department, and there have been many failed attempts. The original outsourcing boom of the 90s (which mostly failed) was an attempt to do this. Developers are expensive, tend to fail more than they succeed (the IT failure rate should be a scandal) and to the MBA class, in ways that accountants or sales people, are not. When it comes to AI, I think its sweet spot is ‘bullshit jobs’. As someone who’s been marketing adjacent for much of their career, I’ve always been struck by how this is essentially a facts free zone. Does marketing work? Nobody knows. How would you measure that. Even if AI made marketing worse, would it matter? And I’m sure there are other jobs with lots of unnecessary work that could be automated easily enough, even if the results were garbage (a lot of corporate translation work has always been very low quality, to give an example). Where it will do a lot of damage is in areas where those making the decisions (the c-suite) do not actually understand the work that is being done. This is already happening in IT (the next Y2K will be cleaning up the slop being generated by AI tools), and I’m sure there are other areas such as accounting where all kinds of errors are creeping in without anyone realizing. In addition, as people get used to AI (and I’ve observed this directly), they stop checking the work. I forsee a lot of corporate disasters over the next few years caused by AI slop due to cost cutting. I also forsee some interesting conversations in the next few years as companies are forced to pay the true cost for AI tools… re: the C-suite, I agree 100%. Upper management at my company talks about AI so much that sometimes it seems like they are glitching. But you can tell that above a certain level they really don’t know what they are talking about. But my company is owned by one of the biggest private equity companies who in turn are heavily invested in AI companies, data centers, and the power generating to run them. So senior execs at my company are in turn just being pummeled at every turn by our PE overlords with the AI directive. No one gets fired for buying AI is the new “no one gets fired for buying IBM” (for now). I hadn’t considered the PE angle, but you’re absolutely right. When this implodes, we’re going to see the mother of all hangovers as the entire corporate class realize they’ve blown a decade’s worth of investment capital on a chimera. Heh, but it ain’t their money. I’ll be gone, you’ll be gone. Wouldn’t it be nice to use that giant hand to squeeze Bezos’s head while asking him nicely to not fire thousands of employees? Just spitballing here I’m a specialist in measurable forms of marketing (direct mail, email, websites) who just got drummed out of his career after 40 years by a contracting employer with a bullsh*tter as its marketing chief. Yes, marketing is measurable. It’s actually quite simple in principle: You measure what happens because of your campaign against a baseline of what happened without it, or what happened versus an alternative. Problem is, many of the best-paid people in marketing have fat paychecks based on pretending that it isn’t. And their clients play along, for reasons as simple as not knowing any better, as human as fearing they’ll be the next ones fired if they dissent, and as vain as finding TV shoots a glamorous experience. As for CEOs, their reaction is the same as it was to the gutting of internal IT or customer service. It doesn’t affect them personally, the outsource vendor makes a really seductive-sounding presentation on how it cuts their cost and goes straight to the bottom line that pegs the CEO’s pay, and he gleefully signs off on it. The resulting tech support/customer experience/marketing is ineffective and awful, but the quarterly report looks great and the CEO doesn’t care because he’ll cash out before the company craters. I’ve told friends that my marketing skills make me feel like a Latin scholar. I have all this knowledge that would still work, but in an era when no one else knows or cares how to hear it. Your observations are spot on. I started programming and writing documentation (and, sigh, managing programmers) back in 1977 at a large high tone university. I didn’t have a degree in IT, but at the time the ambient attitude among the experienced programmers was that “if you need to study this stuff, you’re probably not very good.” And as more IT grads came along things got worse and worse, i.e, the quality of work I could expect from the people I was supervising just kept deteriorating. There were two major factors to which I attributed this deterioration. One was that academia took over the field and the produced a generation of people whose approach to career success was to appear clever, or “ingenius” and never put in the time to sweat all the details that determine the effectiveness of any piece of software. This became more and more true as the crucial components of quality control were increasingly removed from IT experienced senior programmers and taken over by non IT supervisory people or, if you will, the customers. During the 80s I saw much of the programming industry as a kind of hollow jobs program for largely unqualified people. The second factor was the eagerness of non IT senior executives to demand a larger role in how IT was to be implemented. And these people were red meat for the hordes of software and hardware sales crews who descended upon them. I recall telling a highly placed young and eager assistant comptroller that he didn’t need to spend $250K on a new computer whose purchase he’d advocated since what he wanted to get done was a an essentially trivial exercise using some basic software already in place. The most shocking part of that conversation was that he hadn’t realized that the old IBM MVS system could actually do arithmetic. I kid you not, and such episodes were legion. AI could be used to accomplish many useful things, but in the hands of decision makers who lack a deep understanding of its horizons and limitations, the prospects are dubious. A few days ago I read a post (https://scienceforeveryone.science/statistics-in-the-era-of-ai/) by someone who used a higher level of ChatGPT to clean and analyze a data set that had been giving him trouble, checking at each step. Sounded very useful. I have seen other descriptions of using these systems in software development as assistants. They seem to ask “ChatGPT” to do something and check it. (i wonder if you can use these things to do code reviews?) A couple of problems: 1. The self-driving problem: The more often the system works correctly, the less likely you will detect when it does not. 2. How do you know that the system did not sneak a back door into your database system while it was doing what you told it to do correctly. (old problem at least back to one of the Unix Gurus) there is still a strong belief in what remains of the american middle and upper-middle class that trumpismo (including AI, crypto, ICE, the whole sordid package) is simply a bizarre aberration and that “soon” things will snap back to the neoliberal status quo of our youth. nobody’s gonna risk everything on mass action if they think the sun will be back out in ’28, and even if they broadly sympathize with the cause they’d rather other folks take the risk. it should also go without saying that even if power was found lying in the street, nobody on the soi-disant american left would pick it up. this is a good point. you can really see this in every candidate the dems are floating for 2028: they are not even trying to adjust to this new landscape. i think more likely, we will get more institutionally destructive maga type people in power. maybe with the occasional switch to dems in power, but they fundamentally lack the ability to reverse any of the changes made. it’s just going to be a slow nonlinear decline until something breaks. when things will break enough for mass action is the question. i sound like a bit of a doomer here, but i don’t mean to be hopeless. acquisition of enough power to change things is a slow and arduous process, realistically it will take time to organize and build alternative structures. the best thing to do for now imo is to quietly build alternative structures so when collapse gets bad, there is a decent alternative lined up in place. and minimize damage caused. imo. the problem, of course, is that the reactionary right has the church. labor used to have the union hall as a counterweight, and many mainline churches were (and are) decently liberal but with the rise of evangelical politics that door has mostly shut. folks these days are atomized and have zero mentorship in how to lead a movement. the soviet russian rank and file were the vanguard of revolution; maybe if troops here don’t get paid for enough months they’ll wise up. but i doubt it. So is the way to square this circle that AI actually does not perform well, save as a weapon in class warfare? For LLMs, I’m going with yes. This is class warfare and the ego-mad fever dream of what Ed Zitron calls business idiots. It won’t just be a gutting of middle class jobs, the executives will be going as well. Especially since the executive role is symbolic anyway, perhaps the most non-essential of anyone in the org – more so given there are very few real leaders anymore who drive success with charisma and contribution. Their role is merely to be the public or legal face of the org, the signature, the talking head, but since when was a CEO legally liable or responsible for anything? It become an obsolete legal construct. And the BBC has with their AI generated news anchor shown what corporations can do with the C-suite, have they not? I had a prof once who, by way of introduction to programming languages, used the peanut butter and jam sandwich as an example. There is a repeated pattern to the making of the sandwich, and programming is all about capturing to a logic language that repeated pattern, which can then be interfaced with the real world in some way. This was not said, nor intended by the prof, but think about this – any work which is repetitive in any way can be replaced with an algorithm. Therefore, even without AI or LLM, most modern roles being highly repetitive in nature could be replaced with an algorithm. But as mister Musk has learned, humans are highly adaptive and can handle unexpected outcomes better than AI. Musk, he of the aforementioned c-suite? A little more low-tech anecdote—-did rounds at the nearby tech/industrial park, full of the US equivalent of Mittelstand. Only 2 firms (say 16%) had receptionists. everyone else had locked doors and you were met at the door by your party. …which makes utilitarian sense, but still culturally jarring from being used to an environment in which every self-respecting firm had their own receptionist that greeted you when you exited the elevator. lmao. There has been a generational change in what constitutes an “essential” employee, and even the weak-sauce LLM-driven AI is going to accelerate that change. After listening to a interview with Sam Corcos the other day, I’m getting the feeling that the Tech Bros. have decided that their ‘Move fast and break things.’ method is ready for deployment, (Outside of their ‘lane’ so to speak.) I think that’s a dangerous notion. In the wider world, there are all sorts of dangerous pitfalls in breaking things you don’t understand how to fix, or things you don’t have a replacement for. Sam Corcos, Trump’s Chief Technology Officer for Treasury, left me with the distinct impression that the ultimate ( If unstated ) intent of the DOGE program, besides making Peter Theil the anti-christ, is to take control of the government’s procurement system as a whole, in the same manner that they took over USAID’s . After chasing the current population of hogs away from that trough, they intend to put ‘procurement’ under much tighter control, and in my opinion, that means a simple re-direct of all that money into a different set of pockets. The trouble as I see it, is a lot of their plan seems to include ‘Hope,‘ the hope that they can clean up the mess that not knowing enough about the stuff they are about to break is going to cause. Hope is not a tactic…. and all that. Which brings me to the massive recent lay-offs by big tech firms; What the he*l were all those tens of thousands of people doing before they got fired? I think the Tech Bros. are ‘Hoping‘ to demonstrate the immense productivity gains possible with AI. This demonstration could be likened to a monster raise in the betting on a poker hand, IOW, what if the big bet, is a bluff. ‘Demonstrate‘ to the investor class, and all your potential customers that AI is already generating gigantic increases in productivity in your businesses, (look at the layoffs) it will do it for you too. Did the Tech Bros. really replace tens of thousands of important employees with AI? It’s hard for me to think they had tens of thousands of un-important people on their payroll? It’s also hard for me to think that whatever all those people were doing, is now being done really well by AI. “Did the Tech Bros. really replace tens of thousands of important employees with AI?” In short, no. See me comment above with reference to this article: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ Well of course they are. Thank you. The thing is, its not hope for them. They are simply ignorant of systemic effects because the position they occupy in the Neoliberal dispensation has, to date, never been charged for its costs, its always unloaded those costs on “society” which, per Margret Thatcher, they don’t believe exists anyway. Society doesn’t exist, climate change is a hoax, money is digital token. Judge them by what they do, but bear in mind their utter disconnection from reality. I can tell you that by the time I was consulting for Google in 2016 management had no idea what most of the people there were doing, but their margins were so fat no one yet cared. The sooner they break everything, the sooner we get to start picking up the pieces. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an ameliorist not and accelerationist, but the foundation has been completely devoured by the Neoliberal termites and the sooner the real fall starts the more will be left to catch it. RE: It’s hard for me to think they had tens of thousands of un-important people on their payroll In a sane world, they wouldn’t. But we live in the stupid timeline. Give Graeber’s Bulls*it Jobs a read sometime. He describes how in the corporate world, the more minions a manager has, the more important that manager is. So there is incentive to have a staff full of people who don’t do anything. I may have even witnessed this myself…. This was on full display at Google in 2016-18 when I was in and out of their NY campus. Shortly thereafter they started firing people in droves by division. Big Fan of the antithesis: Move slow; Make things Comment of the day for me. Not heard that before but I love it. I will share widely Exactly! Thank you. I’m not necessarily well informed about AI, but I think it is 99% hype. What they call AI is not ‘intelligence’ but is merely super-computing. Stoking fear about AI taking over jobs serves to make workers (even if their jobs are actually perfectly safe from AI) more compliant and more exploitable. I’ve seen videos of how AI may take over the world and cause human extinction. There was a click bait story about how AI tried to murder a human when it believed a human was trying to deactivate it. The concept of an all powerful AI being is ludicrous. AI is a machine, and machines require electric components and electricity to operate. The idea that somehow AI is going to defend itself, repair itself and ensure a constant power supply to itself to prevent being shut down is fantasy. AI is never going to be invincible to having it’s very life shut off by a human cutting it’s circuits or otherwise immobilizing it as there are 1001 ways to kill a machine, even with bare hands. So no, I’m not buying into the fear and hype. Stoking fear about AI taking over jobs serves to make workers (even if their jobs are actually perfectly safe from AI) more compliant and more exploitable. I think this is the most likely impact. Threaten workers with pay cuts, more workload and if they don’t like it, use the fear of AI as a stick. There is still a lot of butt hurt over the short-lived, sporadic displays of worker bargaining power that happened during the beginning of Covid. Someone on Bloomberg suggested that AI not tight money is cause for new structural UE. In my under grad we used slide rules. The calculator and PC did not replace many engineers, but slide rule engineers have a better feel for the math under the solution. To give positive ROI for the trillions or so in AI bubble building, much of it bleeding edge rapidly evolving HW and SW they will have to replace a huge sum of salary. Some of these headlines concern the sales pitch. Long way to go to see an exorbitantly trained LLM compete with a human. AI absolutely will decimate white collar jobs. And AI absolutely isn’t ready to do that today. Making an analogy to relational databases, a concept generated by IBM in the 1970s, it took a decade from the creation of the idea to a working model by Oracle. It then took another decade for the world to adopt them and create valuable, usable products. LLMs are a result of the idea of the “transformer” (the T in ChatGPT) invented by a small team at Google in 2019. Transformers are what made LLMs actually seem to produce valuable information suddenly. And they really do for a lot of use cases. Over time, companies will move from LLMs to much more specialized models for more specific use cases, and an array of products will get created based on those specialized models and needs. Like relational databases, this will take a couple of decades. Once created though, the decimation process will proceed fairly quickly. I expect to hear a lot of RIF announcements every year for a while. Then I expect a massive cascade, resulting in some form of political chaos. They may produce valuable information. In practice what LLMs often create is the illusion of valuable information. Did a quick search on “ai generated entity relationship diagram”. Got plenty of results. No idea how good any of these are. I volunteer on an open-source software project. Only a handful of motivated devs (working in C++). We’ve been using CoPilot for code reviews and lately added Claude. IMO both add value, but you can’t just blindly accept the recommendations. Claude seems to me a bit more polished in that it does some ego-stroking of the dev and provides some cueing like “green checkmarks” to bolster its approval. They are kind of impressive in how they can go from C++, to cmake files, to language translation, to doxygen which would be hard for an individual dev to do. Over time I think their use will improve the code base (much of the core was built via hacker culture without much maintainability thought). We may have reached peak AI, at least in terms of growth of use of the seemingly dominant type, large language models, which are conflated with “generative AI” (sticklers are encouraged to clear up fine points in comments). As someone on the inside let me explain this more in layman’s terms. There are an immense number of models that can be used to perform generative AI, ML, and adjacent tasks. They come in tiny, massive, open source, commercial, free but closed source, and many other variants. They are capable of a whole range of tasks but generally speaking they take some input (an image, a natural-language string of text, links to additional files, video data, etc) and do something autonomously with it to create an output (create a new image, categorize objects in video and provide in list/tag form, generate an explanation based on the input and what the model was trained on, etc). The big leap in capabilities from earlier iterations of this type of thing come from the flexibility in taking the input in natural human language instead of using a formally structured query language. What takes all the focus in the current debate are the current generation of US frontier models, which are the biggest and ‘most capable’ when it comes to general use tasks. These are the OpenAI GPT series and Anthropic’s Claude series. These models were likely trained on the contents of the majority of the public internet and a lot of copywritten or non-copywritten but previously assumed to be protected data, like the uploads on Youtube or torrents of books or pornography. The training data of these models is not made public but since both companies have had to pay out for copyright infringement it can be assumed they did not ask before using the data to train their models which they turn around and sell usage of for revenue; their gamble apparently was that the sort of ‘fair use’ that a human might do (read a book, watch a video) is the same as training a LLM. The training data was required because the idea is these models are to be used for anything the end users might want (“It explains! It codes! It categorizes! It can even translate ancient Akkadian documents!”). The idea apparently behind these massive general purpose models apparently was, if it is big enough and good enough fast enough, we can corner the market before other countries get there. And the revenue model was, if it’s powerful enough for a lot of general use cases, APIs can be used to build out other applications downstream. Those applications would pay API usage fees and their products would be dependent. What has happened instead is that the downstream application layers are building in model-agnosticism for redundancy and cost control reasons. There are so many other options! And what has been discovered is in a lot of cases the general use frontier models aren’t as good as something smaller and hyper-focused on a specific use case. Right now what is happening is for viable use cases, new models – smaller, faster, cheaper, more focused on a specific niche – are being developed and taking over usage from the GPTs and Claudes. “Generative AI” is an offshoot of the above. It is a specific type of use case that leverages output that is created by a model. Like with other use cases, models very specific to a use case are being developed because the frontier models are either too expensive or their training data makes the output of questionable value to a company looking to use the output in their own products. Right now the legal landscape on this is murky. Works that are ‘fully AI generated’ can’t hold copyright and if it can be proven something was generated by a company using an LLM that used fraudulently-obtained training data, the company can be sued and held liable. This is holding up the next phase of the use cases, which are in VFX, animation and video editing and probably music (the first one was software development/coding assistants, the second one is also going to roll out as plugins/extensions to existing editing tooling – this is why right now all those software are pushing unwanted extensions/features of this type – they’re market testing while they do private development). I suspect some deals have been made to get the legal situation ‘resolved’ given the huge amount of activity I’ve been seeing in my work around use cases in that area and the fact that OpenAI is publicly talking about music generation models. Yes, this has been my take on it, although I’m definitely farther from daily usage than you are. But it seems like smaller, domain specific models, are going to be the future. And I think that calls into question the massive buildout of capacity, which seems like it’s unnecessary. I can actually generate pretty-good single speaker transcripts from video with a locally run model on a CPU (non-AI ready), about 25 minutes for 2.5 hours of video. I’m kind of amazed. My larger concern is the entirety of the world is getting blazed by endless AI-generated garbage, on an order of magnitude worse than the spam wars of the early 2000s. What OpenAI is trying to do, tie in LLMs with all kinds of low/no friction transactions and in-app advertising, seems like a hellscape of a world to live in, if it becomes unescapable. And I think that calls into question the massive buildout of capacity, which seems like it’s unnecessary. Something to consider about the build out is that in a lot of cases a particular company is restricted to a specific data center availability zone because of location, prior agreements, other workloads running concurrently, or security requirements. (A big one is security certifications for something like federal or military projects in the US, or GDPR country-specific data requirements in the EU). This means that while the buildout overall might be excessive there will be local restrictions and shortages that mask it. The availability in the data centers around northern Virginia and London, for example, are currently very tight on the cheaper GPU capacity because of proximity to DC gov and London financial services and the associated security certifications required. Even these industries, which have more money than God, balk at paying several hundred thousand a year for an 8-gpu H200 instance running full time. So L240S capacity is exceeded first then they move up to H100 and beyond as those become unavailable. My larger concern is the entirety of the world is getting blazed by endless AI-generated garbage, on an order of magnitude worse than the spam wars of the early 2000s. The next generation of use cases are particularly terrifying on that front because there is a lot of text-to-speech and generative voice as a service being built out. Ostensibly for things like transcription services or the anticipated wave of gen-video that is usable for commercial and advertising needs (and the associated need for gen-audio/voices/speech with voice cloning), all I can think when I look at the API spec is that I need to warn my parents not to believe any sudden urgent calls of any type claiming to be me or any of their friends begging for them to send money to help them with a crisis. Scam spam at scale, as a service for a mere $22/mo. That’s what I was thinking when I couldn’t sleep the other night. Watch out. If you have any digital presence at all, a few minutes of work and someone can extort you for very real looking adult activities with a minor. Only needs to fool some of the people. And BTC makes it easier than ever. Sigh. I came across a YT post on Sim farms. The secret service busted a large sim farm. Scary indeed. https://youtu.be/FIgdXah-VuE?si=6VRTA_p17sKBCcu3 Thank you. I’m still giving some weight to the idea that much of this desire is driven by what has happened with workplace relations (and other effects) since the beginning of the Covid era. Look at the timing. LLMs, the “AI” moniker, etc. had all been around before 2020. In the Breaking Points segment above, Saagar Enjeti suggested that the AI revolution, if it lives up to its hype, could foment an actual revolution by producing two conditons considered to be key to the Russian revolution: declining living standards and elite overproduction. Based on the flaccidness of the No Kings protests, which had significant middle/upper middle class representation, I don’t see it. I concur. I would argue though that the most likely outcome is the complete collapse of the social contract, producing what I can only imagine would be a Hobbesian outcome, which, given the amount of guns around, perhaps will be represented in rampant banditry and things of that nature. Maybe a better example would be 90s Russia, even if I suspect Russia was much better prepared for its collapse than the US is now. Though her work isn’t particularly scholarly, Svetlana Alexievich offered some examples in The Last of the Soviets which were not pretty. “For instance, tarting in the 1980s, big companies…” I think you meant to write, “starting”. Then again…… Here is an example of how Agentic AI is being sold: https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents.html Here is a handy calculator for economic value: https://www.servicenow.com/products/ai-agents/roi-calculator.html/ I have no relationship with the vendor in this example, this is the simplest example of what is going on. Also, I have no idea how realistic this whole thing is, just sharing what is being passed around in these “efficiency” discussions. Service Now is a steaming pile of garbage. It’s enterprise software lol As the resident AI whisperer, on Agents: “Agentic AI” means multi-step workflows using an LLM to power each step of the action. It can be multiple LLM, like a specialized model just for finding the exact right location in a very large image or text file to insert something generated by a different model, like a block of code or a mask for editing frames in a video. The agent is ‘programmed’ depending on the framework/tool used and deployment mesh. For example, in coding assistants, agents can just be a multi-step chat, or they can run in the background based on guidelines saved in the workspace. They can trigger crazy unexpected LLM API charges; horror stories about unexpected 400$ bills from walking away from the computer for a few hours are usually from a poorly-designed agent. For example earlier today I was working on an agent to handle product ticket queues: – step 1, read the ticket; – step 2, search the existing items of work submitted by developers; – step 3, update a status on anything changed, which would trigger a separate workflow elsewhere; – step 4, review items in ‘completed’ state against original product spec; – step 5, search outstanding work to be done relative to the product spec for the completed work item and gather a list of remaining tickets that still needed work; – step 6, write a summary of current status and remaining work to be done on the product spec and pass it back to another system as an update. This agent is scheduled to run every hour and was requested so as to cut down on some admin work the product team is always behind on. Real developers will mutter this can be done with scripts and existing sprint dashboards, and they’re absolutely right. The difference is the ease in setup and maintenance since you don’t have to be a script maestro and have a million cron jobs running with access to a ton of internal services. The agents typically ship with a service mesh and an interface to program them that is visual and takes instruction in natural language and some kind of visual interface to map the workflow steps. They can also use Model Context Protocol servers, which are little programs that pass additional data/context back to the LLM as part of a prompt/step. MCP servers are often used to create connectors between various app services. Think pulling customer data from a CRM and summarizing a transcript from a customer call in a different system and the agent then drafts a customer status summary doc for an agent that is designed to act as a daily activity dashboard. Agents are probably one of the things that will get brutalized when the OpenAI/Anthropic part of the AI bubble pops (which I think is what most people conflate with the ‘AI bubble’ and fwiw I think are hyper overvalued). Right now they’re extremely buzzy so they’re popping up everywhere. They can be used to do stuff like web search in addition to working with internal systems so they have a lot of the same negative network effects on the public web as bots. So far I haven’t seen a really great use case for them that isn’t specific to big organization internal processes. Maybe autonomous research? We’ve been building one to maintain our product documentation based on our actual code internally at work – again the real software devs will huff and puff that docs from code as been around for years and they’re correct – again the difference here is scalability and ease of maintenance over time compared to the existing solutions. If ultimately they are only really useful for internal process automation they won’t need the massive expensive frontier models and cheaper models built into the service mesh will be developed instead. I can see them being useful in specific industry verticals as part of a full use case workflow (animation rigging, video editing, software qa validation) If they end up being useful on the public web, a better/improved standard for autonomous agent interaction with the public web will have to be developed. Already the internet is creaking under the load of the agent crawlers. I like your closing sentence. A naive question would be: what are “agent crawlers” doing? A second naive question would be: what will “agent crawlers” do,considering that they rely on the meager commons and roadkill left of the information highway.? Thank you for the continuing education RJ. Your explanations are clear for this layman, and you often cover the parts of the AI ‘thing’ I don’t hear about. Thanks. But replacing deterministic APIs with this. How can you reliably test these agents? There be dragons there. Using it for internal documentation, what could go wrong? It’ll miss that nuance. You noted these are wasteful as well. Brute forcing web pages to get all stuff better done with a structured API. This is the promise of true no code. Gonna be a debacle instead. For people who used to like mathew taibibi There seems to be a sharper knife available: Ladies and gentlemen coffeezilla You never know how things will pan out but the future looks bleak, Globalism and nationalism are done and they can’t decide who is in charge. Democracies are failing and the dictators are going to hell as well. But on a bright note their are 10,000 nuclear weapons sitting in the dark. What could go wrong with this picture.

Title: Investors are growing skeptical of colossal AI-spending plans by tech giants like Meta and Microsoft

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mega-cap tech firms keep spending loads of cash on AI — and investors are starting to rebel. That was evident after Meta and Microsoft — two of the largest companies at the center of the AI revolution — saw their stock prices drop on Wednesday, after earnings. The catalyst for the losses was newly announced plans from both companies to spend even more on AI in the next year, despite colossal amounts that have already been poured into the AI race. Meta said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion on AI capex in 2025, up from its previous guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company would spend even more on AI in 2026, driven largely by infrastructure costs. Shares of the Facebook parent dropped as much as 14% on Thursday. Microsoft had a similar moment when it reported earnings on Wednesday. The software giant said it spent a record $34.9 billion on capex in the past quarter, up from the $24.2 billion the prior quarter, and said spending could increase in 2026. Shares of Microsoft dropped 3% at intraday lows on Thursday. Confidence in the AI trade has grown increasingly fragile. Talk about a stock market bubble is growing as investors assess massive gains in the market in recent years. They're also aware that monetization plans for AI remain unclear, despite buckets of cash that have already been poured into chips and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google could spend as much as $320 billion on capex primarily related to AI infrastructure this year, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Some investing pros are worried that the ambitious AI spending plans are a parallel to previous market fads that have fizzled out. Meta, for instance, poured billions of investment into the metaverse several years ago, a concept that markets eventually moved on from and led the company to report billions in losses. Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, called the latest stock drops in Meta and Microsoft a "yellow flag" for the AI trade. In a recent note to clients, he said a possible warning for the AI trade could be when a large mega-cap tech company announces plans to spend more on capex, though its stock price drops as a result. He told BI he expected to see that play out among more tech firms in the future, which would constitute a clearer warning that the AI hype is starting to deflate. "When Zuck comes out and says, we're making all these investments based on the best-case scenario for AI because we don't want to be left behind — that's dangerous, right? Because if you don't get that best-case scenario, you are going to have pretty significant write-offs," Berezin said. Jump to

Meta stock crashes 11% after disappointing Q3 earnings report. Shares fell to $667.48. Investors are rattled. A $15.9 billion tax hit crushed profits. EPS dropped to $1.05 versus $6.70 expected. Revenue still jumped 26% to $51.24 billion. But costs exploded. Meta raised 2025 spending to $70–72 billion. More hikes are coming in 2026. Nearly $200 billion in value vanished fast. Traders fear Meta’s AI gamble is overheating. The market is asking one question — is the tech bubble finally bursting?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous. Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model.

Title: Layoffs Continue – UPS and Amazon Switch to AI

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/30/2025 6:56:22 AM PDT by delta7 New and seasonal hires are typically announced during Q4. The opposite is unfolding amid stagflation. UPS announced that, despite favorable earnings, it has cut its operational workforce by 34,000 positions, greater than the initial estimate of 20,000, and an additional 14,000 positions from management. Shrinking a package delivery service ahead of the holiday season signals a broader trend. Artificial intelligence has been employed in operations to meet growing customer demand. The service has loosened its ties with Amazon, delivering 21.2% fewer packages than last quarter while demand during the first half of the year declined by 13%. Amazon itself will cut its workforce by 14,000 in the short term. Similar to UPS, the reduction in workforce is not a result of reduced earnings. A leaked memo also detailed that Amazon will need 600,000 fewer employees in the years to come. Careful rhetoric will surround the shift as people fear AI technology. As Amazon detailed in a blog post: “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Schumpeter BusinessCycle Waves of Creative Destruction This is Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction at play. Innovation is paving the way for new technology while leaving the past behind. Amazon itself and online shopping paved the way for the destruction of the brick-and-mortar stores. By 2020, when the world shut down, consumers relied on the internet for most of their shopping. Amazon expanded by 625% from 2010 to 2020 and continues to grow. The Industrial Revolution expanded, and the Industrialists, led by the auto stocks, drove the 1929 bull market. The invention of the combustion engine led to tractors for farmers, disproving the theories of Malthus that humanity would starve as the population increased. He never understood the cycles of technology, yet he influenced Gates and the Rockefellers. As farmers had tractors, production increased while employment declined. Horse Carriage The horse and buggy were replaced with automobiles. As they expanded, the suburbs came alive. Suddenly, people could live in places without trains. The town I grew up in flourished because we had a train station, which enabled people to buy land and move out of the cities. The town I grew up in expanded further from the train station with the automobile. Creative Destruction Waves cause unemployment to rise, but commerce expands. The shift from humans to AI is happening now. This will disrupt the system, but the world will adapt as it always does.

The service has loosened its ties with Amazon, delivering 21.2% fewer packages than last quarter while demand during the first half of the year declined by 13%. Amazon itself will cut its workforce by 14,000 in the short term. Similar to UPS, the reduction in workforce is not a result of reduced earnings. A leaked memo also detailed that Amazon will need 600,000 fewer employees in the years to come. Careful rhetoric will surround the shift as people fear AI technology. As Amazon detailed in a blog post: “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.” Schumpeter BusinessCycle Waves of Creative Destruction This is Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction at play. Innovation is paving the way for new technology while leaving the past behind. Amazon itself and online shopping paved the way for the destruction of the brick-and-mortar stores. By 2020, when the world shut down, consumers relied on the internet for most of their shopping. Amazon expanded by 625% from 2010 to 2020 and continues to grow. The Industrial Revolution expanded, and the Industrialists, led by the auto stocks, drove the 1929 bull market. The invention of the combustion engine led to tractors for farmers, disproving the theories of Malthus that humanity would starve as the population increased.

Horse Carriage The horse and buggy were replaced with automobiles. As they expanded, the suburbs came alive. Suddenly, people could live in places without trains.

Innovation is paving the way for new technology while leaving the past behind. Amazon itself and online shopping paved the way for the destruction of the brick-and-mortar stores. By 2020, when the world shut down, consumers relied on the internet for most of their shopping. Amazon expanded by 625% from 2010 to 2020 and continues to grow. The Industrial Revolution expanded, and the Industrialists, led by the auto stocks, drove the 1929 bull market. The invention of the combustion engine led to tractors for farmers, disproving the theories of Malthus that humanity would starve as the population increased. He never understood the cycles of technology, yet he influenced Gates and the Rockefellers. As farmers had tractors, production increased while employment declined. Horse Carriage The horse and buggy were replaced with automobiles. As they expanded, the suburbs came alive. Suddenly, people could live in places without trains. The town I grew up in flourished because we had a train station, which enabled people to buy land and move out of the cities. The town I grew up in expanded further from the train station with the automobile. Creative Destruction Waves cause unemployment to rise, but commerce expands. The shift from humans to AI is happening now. This will disrupt the system, but the world will adapt as it always does.

The benchmark US stock market indices opened lower on Thursday after mixed tech results and a hawkish Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 opened in the red, trading 0.56% or 38.44 points lower at 6,852.15, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite opened nearly 1% or 227.21 points lower at 23,731.26, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 0.17% or 81.27 points lower to trade at 47,550.73. As of 7:35 p.m., the S & P 500 fell 0.29% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.69%, while Dow Jones erased losses to trade 0.37% higher. The share price of Meta Platforms tanked more than 12% in the early minutes of trade after the giant's rating was humbled by Oppenheimer to 'perform' from 'outperform' on account of its heavy AI spending. The Facebook and Instagram parent reported revenue growth of 26% that beat market estimates, but that jump was outpaced by a 32% increase in costs. Other major names like Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. also traded in the red, 0.51% and 2.16% lower respectively. The grass was greener for other market titans like Apple Inc., which traded 0.60% higher. Oracle's stock also traded 2.30% lower at $269.23 on Thursday after the US market opened. Six out of the 11 sectoral indices were trading lower, with consumer discretionary leading the decline, while five traded in the green with the financial sector leading the gains.

The Bloomberg Dollar Index was up 0.4%, with the British Pound down 0.4% to $1.31 and the Japanese yen slipping 1% to 154.29 per dollar. Bitcoin, the largest traded cryptocurrency, fell 3.3% to $107,736.58.

Title: AI valuations and market volatility: What leasing sector boardrooms need to know
URL: https://www.leasinglife.com/comment/ai-valuations-and-market-volatility-what-leasing-sector-boardrooms-need-to-know/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T13:38:15Z
Full Content:
The Bank of England’s recent warning about an overheated AI stock market should give leasing-sector boardrooms serious pause for reflection. In its October 2025 Financial Stability Report, the central bank flagged ‘stretched valuations’ in tech and AI stocks and warned of increased vulnerability to a sharp correction. While this might sound like a distant capital markets issue, it has relevance for the leasing and asset finance industry. As a technology partner to global finance and leasing companies in the United Kingdom, in Europe and across the world, NETSOL offers the following perspective on what’s unfolding and how to respond. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more What makes today’s AI-driven investment boom particularly fragile is the deep interconnectedness between a few dominant players. Partnerships between NVIDIA, OpenAI, Microsoft and others have created a tightly bound ecosystem: chipmakers supply compute power, cloud giants host models and AI firms build software layers on top. Capital, infrastructure and R&D are deeply intertwined, regularly investing in one another. In fact, only seven tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, Tesla, Microsoft and Alphabet, now account for roughly 30 % or more of the S&P 500 by market‑capitalisation. What this means is that almost all of the index’s growth is being driven by these ‘Magnificent Seven’, who are themselves leveraging the AI boom to reshape, and in some cases dominate, the world economy. This means that a shock to one major player, whether through valuation collapse, infrastructure failure or regulatory action, could cascade throughout the ecosystem. And because many leasing firms are now using AI, whether directly within their operations or indirectly through the technologies they finance, any major disruption in the AI ecosystem could have a tangible impact across the sector. Despite its potential, much of the AI sector’s sky-high valuations are not backed by real, sustainable cashflows. NVIDIA stands out as a powerful exception, posting record-breaking profits on the back of unprecedented demand for its chips, yet this success contrasts sharply with others in the ecosystem. OpenAI, for instance, is attempting to convert its roughly 700 million users from free to paid at an estimated 2% rate, with no clear path toward the ambitious $200 billion revenue target it has set for 2030. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. It’s not just investor enthusiasm driving these prices – it’s speculative belief in future transformation. That may be valid in the long run, but from a governance standpoint, it qualifies as a classic asset bubble. Boardrooms should recognize this disconnect: if the cash doesn’t support the valuation, the correction can be severe, especially in capital-intensive industries like leasing, where technology adoption cycles and ROI timelines are longer. Not all AI players are heading in the same direction, which introduces uncertainty. For example: OpenAI has announced it will soon allow adult content generation in ChatGPT for verified users, with a tactical move aiming to boost monetisation through consumer engagement. Anthropic, by contrast, is doubling down on enterprise AI, targeting regulated industries and B2B productivity tools. These divergent strategies reflect monetisation pressure and reveal how unsettled the business models behind AI still are. This matters for leasing firms betting on AI-enhanced platforms: some tools may not survive if their creators fail to monetise them effectively. A correction won’t end the AI era, but it will reshape the competitive and capital landscape. Boardrooms should anticipate the following developments: Consolidation at the bottom: Smaller or venture-backed AI startups without clear paths to revenue will either shut down or be absorbed by larger players. This could disrupt vendors, APIs or tech-stack integrations in leasing platforms. Capital redirected to less-exotic, high-fundamentals ventures: Investors will pivot toward services with clearer ROI. For example, platforms that enhance operational efficiency, customer experience or asset management, rather than experimental consumer tools. Pricing pressure on large AI firms: With monetisation under pressure and low conversion rates (for example, OpenAI’s free-to-paid users remain in the single digits), big players may cut prices or chase aggressive user acquisition. This could create risk for those leasing or integrating AI-linked platforms whose economics rely on sustained premium pricing. At the same time, operational costs for these platforms may decrease. For example, a lower price per million tokens, which could offer some relief or efficiency gains for users. More scrutiny on business outcomes: The AI tools that survive and thrive will be those that deliver measurable value i.e. improved residual forecasting, automated customer service and predictive maintenance. Not just hype. Is there one item that impacts the leasing industry? Even if small. May be not. Even if a bubble bursts, AI innovation itself will not slow down. Research from the Oliver Wyman Forum shows that industry leaders are already capturing measurable gains, in some cases, over 10% improvements in revenue or cost efficiency. These companies aren’t experimenting; they’re transforming operations at scale. Productivity and scalability remain key issues for most leasing companies and AI will inherently bring much-needed gains that drive improved shareholder returns. That’s the key takeaway for the leasing sector: a correction in market sentiment doesn’t mean AI stops delivering value. But it does mean that capital, strategy and partnerships will pivot toward grounded, ROI-driven solutions. NETSOL advises leasing and asset finance leaders to take the following actions in light of the Bank of England’s warning: We believe the leasing sector is entering a critical phase. The promise of AI is real, and for many of our clients, already impactful. But boardrooms must balance optimism with risk awareness. The Bank of England is right to issue a warning. But the right response isn’t retreat. It’s disciplined innovation. Lease smarter. Digitize with intent. Prioritize tools that tie directly to operational performance and financial returns. And above all, remember: the future belongs to those who prepare, not just predict.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has soared 13% in a week, driven by significant momentum in the AI sector. This surge is fueled by two major catalysts: Given this dramatic 13% increase, it is a fundamental part of a robust investment strategy to re-evaluate the stock’s position. Below is a comparison of Broadcom against its peers, focusing on key financial metrics such as size, valuation, growth, and margin. For some context, Broadcom delivers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Why does this matter? AVGO recently rose by 17% in a month – a peer comparison places stock performance, valuation, and financials in a broader context – indicating whether it is genuinely outperforming, lagging behind, and ultimately – can this trend continue? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to determine if Broadcom stands as a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally – observe how the stock has historically dipped and recovered through AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are losing ground amid a barrage of earnings reports from major companies, as investors assess the latest developments in trade talks and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's warning that more rate cuts aren't a certainty; President Donald Trump said his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping resulted in a rare earths mineral agreement and a reduction in certain tariffs on China; shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are losing ground after the Magnificent Seven members reported results late yesterday, while Alphabet (GOOG) shares are surging after the Google parent reported more than $100 billion in quarterly sales; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are due to release their quarterly reports after the closing bell; and Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the company reported strong sales of weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are lower as investors digest a flurry of corporate earnings reports and evaluate the results of trade talks between the U.S. and China. The major indexes hit record highs yesterday but gave back early gains after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that another interest rate cut at the upcoming December meeting was “not a foregone conclusion—far from it." The comments came after the Fed trimmed its benchmark rate for the second time in as many months to support a labor market that has weakened. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq slipped 0.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer and business loans, was at 4.10%, up from 4.06% at yesterday's close and at its highest level in three weeks. Bitcoin was at $109,800, down from an overnight high of around $111,600. Gold futures fell slightly from yesterday's close to $3,985 an ounce, and are well off the record high of near $4,400 set early last week. President Trump reportedly said that “a lot of decisions were made” in his meeting with Chinese leader Xi on Thursday, potentially signaling a thaw in trade relations between the two nations. Trump said that an agreement on rare earth minerals was reached after China restricted exports of the key product for high-tech manufacturing. The agreement will need to be renewed every year. Trump also said that U.S. tariffs targeting China’s fentanyl production were reduced to 10% from 20%, taking overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese products down to 47%. More negotiations could be coming as Trump said he will visit China in April, with Xi making a visit to the U.S. sometime after that. The agreements are expected to add some certainty to U.S. trade policy after tariff announcements roiled markets earlier this year. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are lower in premarket trading after the Magnificent Seven members delivered their highly anticipated quarterly results, while Alphabet (GOOG) stock soared after the Google-parent hit a new revenue milestone. Alphabet’s earnings topped Wall Street expectations as quarterly revenues topped $100 billion for the first time, with each of its major business segments reporting sales growth of at least 10%. Microsoft also posted better-than-expected earnings as quarterly revenue jumped 18% year-over-year, led by 28% growth in cloud sales, though the stock fell amid concerns about the company's capital spending plan. Facebook parent Meta also reported strong revenue growth, but a one-time $16 billion tax charge helped sink its earnings well below estimates. Alphabet shares were up about 8% ahead of the opening bell, while Meta tumbled 9% and Microsoft declined 2%.. More Magnificent Seven company earnings are on tap today, with Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) set to release results after the closing bell. Apple shares hit record highs recently, boosting its market capitalization above $4 trillion (only Nvidia and Microsoft have higher market values), following a report that showed solid sales of newly released iPhone 17 models. Apple’s stock has fallen after recent earnings reports on investor worries over its progress on AI products. Meanwhile, Amazon has been the laggard among “Mag 7” stocks this year, and options pricing suggests that traders expect a big move for the online retailer’s share price after the earnings report is released today. Apple shares were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading, while Amazon stock fell more than 1%. Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are rising after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected earnings on strong demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly reported third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion, a jump of 54% over the prior year and ahead of analyst estimates of $16.1 billion as tracked by Visible Alpha. The company’s adjusted earnings per share of $7.02 beat the consensus estimate of $5.91. Eli Lilly reported strong sales growth of key drugs, with worldwide Mounjaro revenue doubling to $6.52 billion, while U.S. sales of Zepbound nearly tripled to $3.57 billion. Eli Lilly shares were up 4% in recent premarket trading.

Meta’s stock dropped after its latest earnings report and a downgrade from Oppenheimer. The company’s big spending on artificial intelligence and a large tax hit worried investors.

Title: Who backed Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package? Here's how Tesla shareholders voted on CEO's compensation last year

Only six days are left for Tesla's Annual General Meeting and a decision on CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation package. Last month, the electric vehicle giant's board proposed a groundbreaking compensation package to motivate Musk to stay actively involved with Tesla for the next 10 years, and the shareholders are set to vote on it. However, several critics, including Democratic US state leaders and union officials, have criticised the sizable package and launched a campaign to reject the offer, Reuters reported. The shareholders are scheduled to vote on November 6. Several attempts have been made to prevent earlier record payouts to Musk, such as his $56 billion compensation plan for 2018, which investors reapproved last year despite ongoing legal challenges, it added. Here's a look at Tesla's five largest shareholders, excluding Musk, and how they voted for last year’s ratification of the CEO's 2018 pay package. Investment firm Vanguard has 251,390,681 shares and a stake worth $116 billion in Tesla as of June 30, 2025, according to Nasdaq data. The company owns 7% of Tesla, making it the biggest shareholder after Musk, who holds a 13% share. Last year, Vanguard voted for Musk's pay package despite opposing it for 2018 due to its potential size, Reuters reported. BlackRock, which reportedly has nearly 6% share in Tesla and a more than $95 billion stake, had 205,962,777 shares as of June 30, 2025. In a release last year, BlackRock said the company voted in favour of Musk's pay package. Global financial services company State Street is the third-highest shareholder of Tesla, excluding Elon Musk. The company has a stake worth $52 billion with 113,418,687 shares. State Street reportedly voted against Musk's whopping pay package in 2024, according to an X post by Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor. The asset manager had a nearly $29.9 million stake in Tesla and 64,767,993 shares as of June 30, 2025. Geode Capital owns nearly 1.8% stake in Tesla. Last year, the company voted for Musk's compensation. Investment bank JP Morgan Chase has 46,015,610 shares in the EV giant, worth $21.2 billion as of June 30, 2025. With a share of over 1% in Tesla, the bank voted in favour of Musk's pay package, Merritt noted. In September, Tesla's board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The payout depends on growing the company's market capitalisation from roughly $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion and achieving various operational goals and targets, Reuters reported The board plans to award Musk up to 423.7 million performance-based restricted shares, which amounts to roughly 12% of the company's current shares. These will be distributed in 12 equal tranches. It further outlines 12 market capitalisation goals, including $2 trillion mark, then nine increments of $500 billion each, and concluding with two $1 trillion milestones, totalling $8.5 trillion. The EV maker has set 12 operational milestones, such as deploying robotaxis and robots, and increasing profits as measured by adjusted EBITDA. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged shareholders to vote against the plan. On October 17, ISS expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla and others such as Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and xAI. Tesla denied ISS claims, with Elon Musk at the company's earnings call saying, “There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Mumbai: When India’s largest company announced a big-bang joint venture (JV) with the world’s biggest asset manager to enter the country’s fast-growing mutual fund industry, it marked the coming together of two titans, and ratcheted up speculation to fever pitch. After all, this was in a sense the corporate equivalent of Sachin Tendulkar teaming up with Lionel Messi. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is not known to play second fiddle in any industry it sets its sights on. And BlackRock, with assets under management of a staggering $11 trillion, is referred to as the third most important economic entity on the planet, behind only the US and China. This is BlackRock’s second innings in the Indian mutual fund arena, after its 10-year JV with DSP ended abruptly in 2018, reportedly after both partners sought full ownership of the business. After receiving all the requisite regulatory approvals by June, JioBlackRock Asset Management Company (AMC), the 50:50 JV between RIL subsidiary Jio Financial Services and BlackRock, commenced operations by launching three cash funds, followed by five index funds in August. The new fund offer (NFO) for its maiden actively managed equity product, a flexicap fund, closed earlier this month. Many industry watchers saw this as an uncharacteristically subdued start for a company with this pedigree. Initial impressions, however, have a tendency to be deceptive. In an interview with Mint, Sid Swaminathan, JioBlackRock AMC’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), was unambiguous about the company’s goals: “We want to be among the top five players in the industry over the next five years or so." Swaminathan smiled when asked about market expectations of the AMC making a high-voltage debut along the lines of Jio, which disrupted the telecom market in 2016 by launching zero tariff plans. His response was cautious: “The two are not comparable. These are two very different industries in terms of competition, regulations and customers." JioBlackRock, he said, had a clear cut approach: “First, growing the overall industry. Then bringing in differentiated products, differentiated value propositions and differentiated ways of getting people to access these products." Rather than one major disruption, Swaminathan said, “I would call it a series of micro disruptions. That’s how we have approached it." Whether a single earthquake or a series of tremors, one thing is beyond doubt: it would take something momentous to make a dent in India’s mutual fund market, which currently has 54 companies managing assets worth ₹75 trillion across around 2,000 schemes. It’s a tall task, but that’s where the American partner’s track record comes into the picture. Black boxJioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework. While this may sound awfully like just another marketing buzzword, it portends something much more significant. Systematic Active Equities is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios. What sets it apart from most traditional quant models is that in addition to financial data, it analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights. BlackRock acquired SAE as part of its buyout of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 (the unit actually traces its roots to an investment firm set up by Wells Fargo in 1971). SAE now employs over 200 portfolio managers and researchers, many of whom are PhDs in various subjects, including physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. The convergence of traditional and unstructured datasets has worked wonders for the SAE unit, which has assets under management of $300 billion across equities, fixed income and alternatives. An astounding 93% of SAE’s assets have outperformed their benchmarks or peer median over the past year, compared to 47% for the Fundamental Equity division, according to BlackRock’s Annual Report for 2024. Over the past three years, 89% of SAE assets have beaten the benchmark, while the figure rises to 93% for the five-year period. The Fundamental Equity division picks stocks using fundamental methods, i.e. human analysts and researchers. This SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. “It’s a very risk controlled fund, so it will look to protect on the downside and then look to generate consistent alpha over the long term. If we are able to do that consistently over a two- to three-year period, which is what our backtests have shown us, then it is going to give you returns in line with the best ones up there," said Swaminathan, who has served in various leadership roles at BlackRock, including as its head of Index Equity, International, in London, where he oversaw assets worth $1.25 trillion. “And because of the way it is constructed, it looks, feels and behaves very differently to existing funds in the market." Explaining how the SAE framework can offer a competitive advantage, Swaminathan said, “Let’s say you are analyzing banks. You can obviously wait for the quarterly numbers. But you can also get faster information in some cases by looking at credit card swipes, for example. What’s the frequency of swipes, how is it trending compared to the sectoral averages and so on." The SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. That intelligence, he says, enables one to form a more immediate-term view instead of waiting for the quarterly results. “And if we have a platform that is able to absorb all this data, clean that data and transform it into insights in combination with more traditional data points like valuations, profitability, PE ratio etc., then we believe there’s an opportunity to generate alpha." The other element is scale. A fund manager and his team can read and analyze a limited number of analyst reports, but a machine can read thousands of them. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), says Swaminathan, BlackRock is also able to generate things like tone and sentiment much more accurately from those reports. “So, you are no longer limited by human brain power capacity. If a traditional set-up using fund managers and analysts can do in-depth research on say 30-40 stocks, our models can do it for hundreds," he said. So, rather than taking concentrated positions in a handful of stocks, it enables smaller active positions on a larger universe of stocks, “which not only allows you to generate alpha but do it with lower risk". Global vs localThanks to the explosion of data in recent years, combined with the emergence of powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), quant firms are engaged in an arms race with each other to extract even the tiniest additional insight. However, first-mover advantages dissipate very quickly in this cut-throat space and there’s nothing like a permanent magic wand. This makes it imperative for AMCs not just to keep hunting for new sets of data but also dynamically adjust their weightages and mathematical models in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The question is whether relying on this approach will work in a comparatively opaque market like India. “The good news is that there’s a lot of data being generated in every sector of the economy, so a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking," Dhirendra Kumar, founder and CEO of Value Research, told Mint. “That said, just this cannot be your unique selling proposition. In fact, there are many quant models being used by domestic mutual funds and institutions that incorporate non-traditional datasets as well," he added. “So, BlackRock’s or anyone else’s models will have to prove themselves in the market over a sustained period." Then there is the question of adjusting for local nuances. In the US, for example, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Swaminathan declined to share details about other datasets tracked by JioBlackRock, but said there’s an entire array of data points being collated though not all are relevant from a sector or stock perspective. In the US, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Also making its India debut is Aladdin, BlackRock’s investment management and risk analytics platform. It stands for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network. Aladdin has an India risk model built exclusively for the JV, which allows JioBlackRock’s fund managers to filter stock selections and assign appropriate weightages to data signals. But more than AI, ML and sophisticated quant models, Swaminathan insists SAE’s secret sauce for success is something else. “The key differentiator is that the technology, data, AI and humans are all integrated. Humans (fund managers and researchers) are involved in every aspect, from the first step of selecting the stock universe to subsequent processes of data analyses and insights," he said. The team, said Swaminathan, has the ability to look at the entire stock recommendation output of the models and filter out companies based on, say, corporate governance issues or other risk factors. “This is what separates SAE from other black box quant models," he emphasized. Last mileIndia’s mutual fund industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s financial landscape, with assets under management (AUM) surging more than seven-fold in just over a decade on the back of rising retail participation, mainly through systematic investment plans (SIPs). The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential. Swaminathan does not rule out physical distribution at some point down the line, but said the focus at the moment is to fully harness the “power of the phone". Bold and beautiful?The opportunity is huge, but so are the challenges. Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS, said JioBlackRock’s digital-only approach is a bold experiment in a market where over 70% of mutual fund inflows still come through distributors. View Full Image In India, over 70% of mutual fund inflows are generated through distributors. (istockphoto) But it’s not entirely misplaced. India’s wealth ecosystem has changed sharply in the past five years—demat penetration has crossed 140 million, SIP accounts are rising by 20–25% annually, and over a third of new mutual fund investors are digital-first. This signals that a meaningful segment is now comfortable investing directly through platforms. However, distribution remains the backbone for scale and trust in the mutual fund industry, especially outside metros, where investor education and hand-holding are crucial. “JioBlackRock may find digital distribution efficient for cost control and urban adoption, but for deeper penetration and AUM scale, partnerships with RIAs (registered investment advisers), fintechs, or even traditional distributors might become inevitable," Srivastava added. “The future of distribution in India is hybrid, where digital channels drive discovery and onboarding, while advisors and distributors retain the role of building long-term conviction." It also helps to be part of the Jio family, which houses the country’s largest telecom operator, with 506 million subscribers as of 30 September. “We are already integrated within the Jio Finance app, which has millions of people coming every month to do their finances. We also have a presence in the MyJio app, which has hundreds of millions coming in every month for telco and other needs," said Swaminathan. In addition, the AMC has partnered with digital platforms like Paytm, Groww and Zerodha to distribute products. The early results have apparently been “more than encouraging". “We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. But what’s even more encouraging to me is that more than 10% of those are first-time investors," said Swaminathan. “Our customer base already covers some 17,000 PIN codes, which is around 90% of the PIN codes in India. And we have only just begun," he added. We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. —Sid Swaminathan Well begun may be half done, but the same does not always hold true for foreign asset managers in India. The list of global titans exiting the domestic mutual fund market is a long and distinguished one, and includes the likes of Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs. Asked about this, Swaminathan said localised offerings and patience are crucial for success. BlackRock itself is taking a second swing at the Indian market, though Swaminathan insists the dynamics are completely different this time. The current joint venture is not between two asset managers. This is between BlackRock as the asset manager and Jio Financial Services, which brings in a deep understanding of the retail consumer along with digital distribution, he insisted. So, what are its near-term plans? Swaminathan said it would continue to have funds that cater to institutional investors as they are an important base for the AMC. “In retail, we want to have index as well as actively managed offerings," he said. Exchange traded funds and specialized investment funds are in the pipeline. For now, the market will be keenly tracking how JioBlackRock’s funds perform in the crowded space. As the JV’s foreign partner and its marquee peers will attest, it takes more than just a brand name to entice an Indian investor.

The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential. Swaminathan does not rule out physical distribution at some point down the line, but said the focus at the moment is to fully harness the “power of the phone". Bold and beautiful?The opportunity is huge, but so are the challenges. Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS, said JioBlackRock’s digital-only approach is a bold experiment in a market where over 70% of mutual fund inflows still come through distributors.

India’s wealth ecosystem has changed sharply in the past five years—demat penetration has crossed 140 million, SIP accounts are rising by 20–25% annually, and over a third of new mutual fund investors are digital-first.

However, distribution remains the backbone for scale and trust in the mutual fund industry, especially outside metros, where investor education and hand-holding are crucial. “JioBlackRock may find digital distribution efficient for cost control and urban adoption, but for deeper penetration and AUM scale, partnerships with RIAs (registered investment advisers), fintechs, or even traditional distributors might become inevitable," Srivastava added. “The future of distribution in India is hybrid, where digital channels drive discovery and onboarding, while advisors and distributors retain the role of building long-term conviction."

In addition, the AMC has partnered with digital platforms like Paytm, Groww and Zerodha to distribute products. The early results have apparently been “more than encouraging". “We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. But what’s even more encouraging to me is that more than 10% of those are first-time investors," said Swaminathan. “Our customer base already covers some 17,000 PIN codes, which is around 90% of the PIN codes in India.

Title: OpenAI Reportedly Planning ‘Up to $1 Trillion’ IPO as Early as Next Year

Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes An anonymously sourced report from Reuters claims that OpenAI is planning an initial public offering that would value the AI colossus at “up to $1 trillion.” Just on Tuesday the company formally completed its slow evolution from an ambiguous non-profit to a for-profit company. Now it appears to be formalizing plans to become one of the world’s centers of economic powerâat least on paper.Â Â The $1 trillion report comes from “three people familiar with the matter.” Reuters’ sources claimed that OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar has been telling OpenAI “associates” that an IPO is coming in 2027, but that actually it could come in late 2026.Â Judging by the current ranking of companies by market capitalization, a $1 trillion valuation would make OpenAI the 12th most valuable publicly traded firm on Earth, just below Berkshire Hathaway, and just above JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.Â A publicly traded OpenAI would make for a fascinating case study, since shareholders really do expect companies to bring in money instead of just spending itâsomething OpenAI has notoriously had a hard time doing so far. As Elon Musk once put it, “There’s immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter.”Â Becoming public can force a lot of information about a company’s real value into public viewâquarterly and annual reports on finances most famously, but also everything about the company’s history that goes in an IPO prospectus. Institutional investors buy shares based on that prospectus, and when the company does go public, its merits can be judged harshly by Wall Street traders, as happened with Uber when it went public in 2019, and its stock price immediately plunged. Companies can also sense which way the wind is blowing if things aren’t going well, and withdraw an IPO before the company gets humiliated, as happened with Ari Emmanuel’s talent agency Endeavor Group in the same year as Uber’s humiliating debut. In a livestream on Tuesday, Sam Altman made similarly grandiose claims about 13-figure sums of money. According to Axios, he said eventually he’d like to build one gigawatt’s worth of new data center capacity per week, which he expects to cost 20 billion per gigawatt. Add it up yourself, and that’s over $1 trillion per year. “Eventually we need to get to hundreds of billions a year in revenue, and we’re on a pretty steep curve towards that,” he claimed. He also added (again, per Axios) that going public “is the most likely path for us given the capital needs that we’ll have and, sort of, the size of the company.”Â Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. The de Blasio "impersonator" was profiled in 2020. But he didn't have AI back then. On an earnings call, Zuck acknowledged that Metaâs massive AI spend might not go as intended in the near future. The rise of artificial intelligence is driving a surge of data center construction across the United States, and rural communities are feeling the impact. The old OpenAI is dead. Now to Figure Out the Profit Part. The company's position seems to be that's not that bad. Don't sext Clippy. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: Morgan Stanley Buys Equity Trading Platform in Private Investment Push

The investment bank has acquired EquityZen, giving Morgan Stanley clients greater access to private company investments. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Democratization is the word on the street in private markets, and Morgan Stanley knows it. The investment bank has bought EquityZen, a company that lets investors buy and sell stakes in private companies. EquityZen bills itself as a way for investors looking to get into private assets to get in contact with equity shareholders of private companies. The deal will enable Morgan Stanley advisors to offer clients private investment opportunities in companies that aren’t available anywhere else. “Companies are staying private longer and longer,” EquityZen CEO Atish Davda said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “The number of publicly listed companies continues to be at an all-time low, and so if you’re an investor only investing in public stocks, you’re missing out on where more value creation could be occurring.” It’s all part of a private markets trend that is seemingly taking over wealth management. In 2019, Morgan Stanley acquired Solium Capital, a Canadian software-as-a-service platform, and rebranded it as Shareworks; it has been used by private companies since 2021 as an equity compensation platform. Shareworks is part of Morgan Stanley at Work, which offers both public and private companies’ employees retirement plans, financial education tools and other services. The deal will increase their access to private shares and give Morgan Stanley at Work participants more liquidity options, according to a release. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. “[Morgan Stanley has] been servicing private companies for a very long time,” Davda said. “The piece that’s been missing is the piece that connects all of that supply to the demand side.” More Privates Please. The deal is also representative of the broader goal of democratizing access to private investments across wealth management. Last year, BlackRock folded in data on some 200,000 private investments in a $3.2 billion deal with UK-based data and analytics firm Preqin, and demand for the asset class has been rising. Part of the allure is accessing the more than 95,000 private companies that have annual revenues of over $100 million, compared to the roughly 10,000 publicly listed ones, according to research from Russell Investments. That works out to an additional $56 per retirement payment, bringing the average monthly benefit to more than $2,000. Private equity, private credit and real assets — such as real estate and infrastructure — all serve different purposes in client portfolios. As mega RIAs get bigger, some advisors are saying that the independent channel is beginning to look a lot like Wall Street. Florida-based Hinck Private Wealth Management is the latest formerly Commonwealth team to join Osaic’s growing network of RIAs. Women’s average spending on art and antiques was 46% higher than men in 2024, according to UBS data. SIFMA called the current regulations burdensome, costly and unnecessary. Sub-acquisitions made up 31% of all RIA M&A activity in 2025 amid rampant private equity investment in the industry. Private equity and venture funds now account for roughly 12% of investments in the US. Pretty much all of Wall Street reported another quarter of stellar earnings this week. As others have sought 3x leveraged ETFs, VolatilityShares is going further, raising the question of what the SEC’s leverage limit could be. Shah will remain with the company until the end of the year in an advisory capacity. Company CEO Yoav Zurel criticised the firm for blocking customers from accessing their 401(k)s. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Circular Investment Deals in AI Look Similar to the Dot-Com Bubble

Please buy my product, and I’ll use the money to buy yours. Flurry of Circular Deals The Wall Street Journal asks Is the Flurry of Circular AI Deals a Win-Win—or Sign of a Bubble? If this reminds you of circular investment in the dot-com era, it’s because it should. The Journal points out Lucent’s lending of billions of dollars to upstart telecom companies fueling Lucent’s growth. When the financing went bust the scheme crashed. Now, AMD is paying OpenAI to be a customer, albeit in a different way. The same is going on with Nvidia and OpenAI. But at least it’s not debt financed. Nvidia’s More Questions Than Answers Deal Reuters reports More Questions than Answers in Nvidia’s $100 Billion OpenAI Deal Nvidia’s (NVDA), move to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI at the same time it plans to supply millions of its market-leading artificial intelligence chips to the ChatGPT creator has little precedent in the tech industry.Under the deal, Nvidia will be taking a financial stake in one of its largest customers, but without receiving any voting power in return, according to a person close to OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker will receive some – but not nearly all – of the capital it needs for its ambitious plans to build the sprawling supercomputers required to develop new generations of AI. Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment would go toward a gigawatt of capacity using its next-generation Vera Rubin chips, with a build-out starting in the second half of 2026. The deal raises many questions. Here are five of the biggest ones: Where Does the Rest of the Money Come From? Nvidia has committed to investing in OpenAI to help it build 10 gigawatts of data center capacity, or about $10 billion per gigawatt. That leaves about $40 billion in additional capital required for each gigawatt of capacity OpenAI plans to build. OpenAI has not signaled whether it agrees with Huang’s cost estimates or, if it does, where it would procure the additional funds. What Does it Mean for OpenAI’s Effors to Become a For-Profit? OpenAI is a non-profit corporation, a structure that dates to its days as an AI research group. It has been looking to change to a more conventional structure that would allow it to more easily raise money and hold a public offering. Reuters that Nvidia would be making a cash investment into OpenAI similar to other OpenAI investors. Moreover, Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment will not begin until OpenAI and Nvidia reach a definitive agreement in the coming months. What Does it Mean for OpenAI’s Valuation? OpenAI is currently valued at $500 billion, and a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Nvidia’s initial $10 billion investment for one gigawatt of capacity would be at that valuation. But neither Nvidia nor OpenAI gave a timeframe for the entire 10 gigawatts of capacity coming online or for the $100 billion of investment to take place. Also unanswered is whether subsequent Nvidia investments in OpenAI would take place at OpenAI’s current valuation, or at the valuation of the company at the time Nvidia makes each investment. What Does it Mean for Competition? The deal between Nvidia and OpenAI could see Nvidia earmarking a significant number of its chips, which remain in high demand several years into the AI boom and access to which can determine success or failure in the field, to a single customer in which it is also a shareholder. An important question is whether OpenAI’s rivals such as Anthropic, or even Microsoft, which competes with OpenAI to sell AI technology to businesses, will retain access to Nvidia’s chips. The deal also raises questions about whether AMD (AMD), which is aiming to compete with Nvidia in selling chips to OpenAI and others, will have a viable chance of selling chips to AI companies. What Does it Mean for Oracle? Oracle (ORCL),said earlier this month that it has signed hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts to provide cloud computing services to OpenAI and a handful of other large customers, which sent its stock soaring and made co-founder Larry Ellison one of the world’s richest people. But one of the key questions lingering after that forecast – and a question that debt-rating firm Moody’s raised – is whether OpenAI has the cash to pay for the contracts. What Does it Mean Synopsis Hundreds of billions of dollars are floating around in circular deals. Can anyone tell me when, where, and how much actual profit comes from this? Meanwhile, all of this investment flurry helped prevent a recession in 2025.

Title: How the Federal Reserve Could Inflate or Pop an AI Bubble

Concerns about an AI bubble have some on Wall Street warily eyeing Silicon Valley, but others say they're looking in the wrong direction. Washington, D.C.—specifically the Eccles Building, where the Federal Open Market Committee sets monetary policy—is where the fate of an AI bubble may be decided, they say. “I think you’re going to have a very hard time popping a bubble when the Fed is cutting rates,” said Jeff deGraaf, Chair and Head of Technical Research at Renaissance Macro Research, on a recent episode of the firm’s weekly Youtube series. The Dotcom bubble, the U.S. housing bubble, and the Japanese bubble of the late 1980s all popped either while or shortly after central banks hiked rates, according to deGraaf. Artificial intelligence has propelled stocks to record highs this year, but recent developments have raised some red flags. A series of circular deals by the likes of AI bellwethers Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI have drawn comparisons to the vendor financing agreements that fueled bubbles in the 1990s. The Magnificent Seven account for 35% of the S&P 500, evidence of an increasingly concentrated stock market. And the benchmark index’s price-to-earnings ratio isn’t far off the Dotcom Bubble’s peak. Financial bubbles form when unbridled optimism about future growth causes asset prices to become detached from their inherent value. Low interest rates can fuel bubbles by depressing returns on low-risk investments and reducing the cost of speculation. High interest rates can have the opposite effect. “I think it’s early,” DeGraaf said of a potential AI bubble, evidence of which he argued doesn’t appear to be “rampant” yet. Though, he warned, “you could have [a] world play out where the economy softens, the Fed is forced to get more aggressive, and the market absolutely goes into the stratosphere because they’re looking at the liquidity. And I think that’s a big disconnect that people don’t appreciate.” UBS analysts made a similar case last month. The Fed, they noted, raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points from June 1999 and May 2000, and those rate hikes were a primary catalyst for the Dotcom bubble's bursting in early 2000. “The current monetary policy environment is very different from back then,” the analysts wrote. The Fed cut interest rates for the second consecutive meeting on Wednesday, and the consensus on Wall Street is that the only direction interest rates are headed anytime soon is lower. Policymakers are walking a tightrope as they pursue both ends of their mandate to control inflation and promote maximum employment. Hiring ground to a halt in recent months while inflation accelerated to its highest rate since January. Fed officials have recently expressed openness to cutting interest rates to support the weakening labor market despite inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday reminded investors that the trajectory of interest rates may be less predictable than expected. "A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion—far from it," said Powell. For one, economists expect inflation to continue accelerating in the coming months, and consumers’ inflation expectations ticked up in October, which could set the stage for one-time price increases to become sustained inflation. On the other hand, a weak job market could hamper wage growth, relieving some inflationary pressure in the process. Analysts at LPL Financial also note that the reason behind interest rate cuts can matter as much for borrowing costs and liquidity as the cuts themselves. Cutting rates five times while inflation is stuck above the Fed's 2% target "could send a signal that the central bank is prioritizing growth over inflation control," which may raise long-term Treasury yields and, subsequently, interest rates on an array of consumer and commercial loans. On the flip side, if the Fed cuts rates less than investors expect, bond prices would likely fall, boosting yields and associated interest rates. Powell on Wednesday expressed doubt that the Fed's interest rate decisions would have much of an impact on the AI investment that's at the heart of Wall Street's bubble concerns. "I don't think interest rates are an important part of the data center story," he said. Rather, he added, investment is being funded by strong businesses at large companies acting on demand signals.

Title: AEP capital spending plan surges 33%, to $72B, in utility ‘super-cycle’

Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:34:43Z

Let Utility Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. In partnership with In partnership with Even with the increasing spending, American Electric Power expects it can limit residential rate hikes to 3.5% a year over the next five years, company officials said. In the last 12 months, AEP’s utilities sold 6% more electricity compared to the previous year, with residential sales up 2.3% and commercial sales up 7.9%, and those sales are expected to continue growing, according to the company. About 2 GW of data centers came online in the third quarter, Trevor Mihalik, AEP vice president and CFO, said Wednesday during an earnings conference call. AEP expects its peak load will hit 65 GW by 2030, up from 37 GW, with demand surging in Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, according to William Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and CEO. The growth estimate includes 28 GW of customers with electric service agreements or letters of agreement, he said. About half of that 28 GW is in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market, 40% in the PJM Interconnection and 10% in the Southwest Power Pool, according to Fehrman. About 80% of that pending demand is from hyperscalers such as Google, AWS and Meta, Mihalik said. The remaining demand growth is from industrial customers with projects such as a Nucor steel mill in West Virginia and Cheniere Energy's liquefied natural gas facilities in Texas, he said. “We are in, I would say, the cat bird seat with regards to connecting data center load,” Fehrman said. “The 765-kV transmission network that we have provides us with an extreme competitive advantage for where these folks are trying to site.” AEP owns about 2,100 miles of 765-kV transmission lines in six states, making up 90% of all 765-kV infrastructure in the U.S., according to the company. “Electricity demand growth is putting pressure on reliability, and this new demand is driving the need for generation diversity, including significant generation additions or retirement delays,” Fehrman said. AEP’s utilities’ integrated resource plans call for adding about 27.2 GW of generation through 2035, including 12.8 GW of gas-fired generation, according to the company. AEP has secured 8.7 GW of gas turbine capacity and has a high-voltage equipment agreement in place with a key industry supplier, according to Fehrman. While some states where AEP utilities operate want to add gas-fired generation, some utility customers remain “heavily interested in renewables,” Fehrman said. AEP’s capital spending plan includes more than $7 billion for renewables, he said. Despite its growing capital spending plan — and expectations for average 9% annual operating earnings growth through 2030 — AEP expects it will be able to keep average annual residential rate increases at 3.5%. “It is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid,” Fehrman said, noting its utilities have approved data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, with pending tariff filings in Michigan, Texas and Virginia. “As we ramp up our investments in this electric infrastructure super-cycle, more of the incremental costs are assigned to commercial and industrial customers who are driving the increased investment,” Fehrman said. AEP utilities are moderating residential rates through affordability “levers,” such as incremental load growth, rate design, a focus on operations and maintenance costs and financing mechanisms like securitization, Fehrman said. AEP expects the combined return on equity at its utilities will increase to 9.5% in 2030 from 9.1% in the last 12 months, partly driven by “legislative and regulatory advancements.” AEP’s utilities have about 5.6 million customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.

Title: 5 Shopify Mistakes That Kill Holiday Profits

Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:42Z

Minor configuration mistakes during the busy Christmas selling season can seriously harm ecommerce profits. Shopify remains the most popular ecommerce platform in the United States. Various sources report that the company has about 29% of the total U.S. hosted ecommerce platform market, or about 21% of the top 1 million ecommerce sites worldwide. Shopify is popular, in part, because of its relative ease of use. The setup is speedy for online sellers willing to accept out-of-the-box themes and a default configuration. Unfortunately, that configuration can also lead to mistakes. What follows are five Shopify setup errors that kill profits when holiday sales rev up. Product feeds to Google and Meta can fail silently. A price mismatch, missing GTIN, or out-of-stock flag can lead to disapprovals that stop some ads from running even while the campaign spends otherwise. Before the holiday rush, store owners and managers should review product feeds aimed at dynamic advertising. In Shopify, this means checking “Google & YouTube,” “Facebook & Instagram,” and any other connected sales app. Each should show products approved and synchronized. A merchant might also notice this when checking product sales channels. Shopify adds a warning if there is a feed problem. A store manager checking for missing channels (below) might have noticed something wrong with the “Google & YouTube” feed. Shopify merchants sometimes assume that publishing a product to their online store automatically makes it visible on Google Shopping, Meta, the Shop app, and Pinterest. It does not. Shopify treats each sales channel separately, and products do not appear in a channel unless explicitly added. This may be true even when an app is installed correctly. Channel exclusion happens frequently for stores selling print-on-demand products such as t-shirts. A shopkeeper might design and publish a t-shirt with Printful and add it to a Shopify collection, unaware that it wasn’t added to every channel. To check, go to “Products” in Shopify and filter by excluded sales channels. Bulk-add any missing channels. Visibility is a foundation of conversion. If an item is not syndicated to every active channel, it might as well not exist. Shopify’s shipping options are flexible and configurable. They can be confusing, too, prompting some ecommerce operations to select a few simple options. Unfortunately, keeping it simple may not work during the holiday crunch. Last-minute holiday shoppers often want lightning-fast delivery and are willing to pay for it. The trouble is that many stores never offer it. In Shopify, go to “Settings” > “Shipping and Delivery.” Open each profile and make sure every product belongs to it. Add at least one two-day or overnight option using carrier-calculated rates. Consider posting a clear cutoff message — such as “Order by Dec. 18 for Christmas delivery.” — on product detail pages. Fast, flexible fulfillment often matters more than price in late December. Shoppers will not buy without a proper delivery option. Shopify’s discount system is powerful and literal. Run multiple promotions at once, and the platform could apply them all unless told otherwise. Ensure discounts work as expected. To be clear, applying multiple discounts to a single order, product, or transaction simultaneously is a valid sales tactic. Plenty of retailers use this approach. Hence discount stacking is built into Shopify. A storewide 20% sale, combined with free shipping and a loyalty code, can materially boost holiday revenue and, potentially, instantly erase margins. Before launching any campaign, open “Discounts” and check for overlapping date ranges or stackable coupons. Consider limiting the store to one automatic or sitewide discount at a time — test checkouts with several products in the cart. Merchants on Shopify Plus may also want to audit their Scripts or Functions. Strong Christmas sales can push a store past tax nexus thresholds — the point at which a merchant is legally required to collect and remit sales tax in a state. Shopify doesn’t necessarily detect new tax requirements automatically. The store may owe taxes if its revenue or transaction volume crosses a given state’s threshold. The problem usually shows up after December, when accountants discover a state in which the store met the threshold but never registered. That missed setup can mean back taxes, penalties, and months of cleanup. Before peak season, review Shopify tax settings. Add every state where the business has physical presence, employees, warehouses, or meets an economic nexus threshold. That threshold is often $100,000 in annual sales or 200 transactions. Enable Shopify Tax or a third-party app such as Avalara to maintain accurate rates. International stores should check “Markets” to confirm the correct VAT and customs settings.

Title: Microsoft's massive AI spending draws investor concerns
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1030/1541263-microsofts-massive-ai-spending-draws-investor-concerns/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T09:00:23Z
Full Content:
Microsoft's AI infrastructure spending to meet growing cloud services demand is outpacing Wall Street expectations, deepening investor fears about the costs of sustaining the boom. The technology giant reported a record capital expenditure of nearly $35 billion for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday and warned spending would rise this year, in a reversal of its earlier prediction that it would moderate. Microsoft's shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading. Alphabet and Meta Platforms also warned of higher spending as Big Tech works to overcome capacity bottlenecks that have hampered companies' ability to fully cash in on booming AI demand. But the rising spending, as well as soaring valuations of tech companies and limited evidence of productivity gains for businesses adopting AI, has raised fears of a bubble reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com boom -- and collapse. Key Microsoft partner and ChatGPT creator OpenAI is also at the center of a web of circular deals and has committed to buy more than $1 trillion in computing power with little detail on how it will fund that purchase. Cloud revenue jumps For now, though, the outlay for Microsoft is paying off. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business grew 40% in the July-September period, outpacing Visible Alpha's estimate of 38.4%. The company's current-quarter Azure growth forecast of 37% was also slightly ahead of estimates of 36.4%. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts on a call that growth could have been higher without the capacity constraints, which Microsoft expects will continue at least until the end of its current fiscal year, in June 2026. Total revenue would be $79.5 billion to $80.6 billion in the current quarter, Microsoft said. Analysts polled by LSEG on average expected $79.95 billion. "The capex number was a little bit worrisome," Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options, said of the decline in Microsoft shares. Profit beat For the July-September quarter, Microsoft said total revenue rose 18% to $77.7 billion, beating expectations of $75.33 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Profit of $3.72 per share also beat expectations of $3.67. The results were not affected by a revised deal with OpenAI that Microsoft announced earlier this week. The arrangement gave Microsoft a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, as well as a cut of sales and access to intellectual property, clearing up uncertainty about the collaboration with the company synonymous with the AI boom. The partnership, which gives Microsoft exclusive access to the models behind ChatGPT, has been key to Azure's rapid growth in recent quarters and strengthened its challenge to top cloud provider Amazon.com. It is also crucial to Microsoft's other AI services, such as 365 Copilot for businesses. That AI push has turned Microsoft into the world's second-most-valuable firm with a $4 trillion market value, trailing only chip maker Nvidia, which made history when it hit a $5 trillion valuation on Wednesday. Microsoft's stock, up nearly 30% this year, is among the best performers in the "Magnificent 7." The after-hours drop in its share price, however, threatened its $4 trillion valuation. Some analysts have praised Microsoft's decision in recent months to let some OpenAI contracts go to Oracle, saying it shows discipline in steering limited AI capacity toward more profitable enterprise customers. The move is part of a broader strategy to lessen Microsoft's dependence on OpenAI by building its own models and partnering with other AI firms, including Anthropic. "We have to balance third-party demand with our own first-party needs, fund our own R&D, and build model capability," CEO Satya Nadella said on the analyst call on Wednesday. "Each time we say no to something (that doesn't serve our long-term interest) I feel better." © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Tokenized Credit Fund: BNY Mellon Expands into CLOs
URL: https://beincrypto.com/tokenized-credit-fund-bny-mellon-expands-into-clos/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T08:04:02Z
Full Content:
Written byShigeki Mori Edited byOihyun Kim BNY Mellon is expanding its blockchain-based asset tokenization strategy by launching a collateralized loan obligation fund. This marks the latest step in the custody bank’s measured approach to bringing traditional financial products on-chain. The Securitize Tokenized AAA CLO Fund, announced on Wednesday, will provide institutional investors access to AAA-rated floating-rate collateralized loan obligations on the Ethereum network. BNY will serve as custodian while its subsidiary, Insight Investment, handles portfolio management. BNY Mellon’s approach reflects a deliberate sequencing strategy adopted by several large financial institutions entering the tokenization space. The bank partnered with Goldman Sachs three months ago to launch tokenized money market funds on Goldman’s Digital Asset Platform. This enabled institutional clients to hold blockchain-based representations of fund shares from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers. The move revealed a methodical progression from simpler to more complex instruments. Securitize announced the launch as “the first tokenized fund focused on AAA-rated CLOs, bringing institutional-grade structured credit onchain.” 6/ With over $1 trillion in global CLO issuance, this fund represents a new way for institutional credit to move onchain, reducing onboarding friction while enabling faster, programmable access. Money market funds represent a relatively straightforward tokenization use case. Their underlying assets are liquid, standardized, and subject to well-established regulatory frameworks, making them a logical entry point for institutions testing blockchain infrastructure. Collateralized loan obligations present additional complexity. CLOs bundle corporate loans into tranches with varying risk profiles. They require sophisticated monitoring of loan performance, cash flow structures, and credit quality metrics. The $1.3 trillion global CLO market involves multiple parties, including originators, servicers, trustees, and rating agencies. Each requires coordination and data access. By moving from money market funds to CLOs, BNY demonstrates confidence in managing more intricate tokenized structures. The bank maintains institutional custody and compliance standards expected by regulators and investors. Traditional financial institutions face distinct challenges when implementing blockchain technology compared to crypto-native firms. Legacy systems must integrate with new infrastructure. Regulatory frameworks designed for conventional markets must be adapted. Institutional clients require the same security standards they expect from traditional products. BNY’s structured credit tokenization approach addresses these concerns through controlled expansion. The bank maintains traditional recordkeeping systems alongside blockchain-based tokens, ensuring continuity if technical issues arise. Custody arrangements remain under established legal frameworks, providing institutional investors with familiar protections. Settlement occurs through permissioned networks rather than fully public blockchains, allowing for oversight and intervention if necessary. This approach allows banks to capture efficiency benefits—faster settlement, reduced reconciliation costs, and programmable features—while maintaining risk controls. Smart contracts can automate cash flows and corporate actions, but ultimate authority remains with regulated custodians. The model contrasts with rapid experimentation, which is common in decentralized finance. Protocols there launch with minimal barriers but face heightened security and regulatory risks. The CLO fund launch positions BNY within a broader competitive landscape around institutional tokenization. Goldman Sachs plans to eventually spin off its Digital Asset Platform as an industry-owned infrastructure. Citigroup has established itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange. BlackRock’s tokenized Treasury fund has grown significantly across crypto-linked products. Prominent asset managers and custody banks are converging on similar tokenized credit strategies. They begin with liquid, standardized instruments, develop operational expertise, and then expand to more complex products. Carlos Domingo, chief executive of Securitize, which has issued $4.5 billion in tokenized assets, characterized the CLO fund as a step toward making high-quality credit more accessible. The company announced plans to merge with Cantor Equity Partners II at a $1.25 billion valuation this week. The news are out! @Securitize has filed to go public in Nasdaq via a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II lead by @Brandonlutnick at a $1.25B valuation 🦄🦄🦄 Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated the tokenized real-world asset market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, up from approximately $35 billion currently.

Title: The Duplicity of Land O’ Lakes Cooperative
URL: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/10/30/the-duplicity-of-land-o-lakes-cooperative/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T05:53:00Z
Full Content:
Image Source: Land O Lakes Co. – Flickr – Public Domain Land O’ Lakes dairy cooperative was founded in 1921 in St. Paul Minnesota by 320 small cooperative creameries. They hoped to improve the quality of butter produced in Minnesota as well as implement better marketing practices thereby improving the profitability of dairy farmers. That’s always been the goal of farmer cooperatives, by working together, groups of small farmers can get better prices for what they sell and pay lower prices for the inputs they have to buy. That was the theory, part of the cooperative thinking that made rural America a better place. Farmer cooperatives were supportive of parity pricing, introduced in Roosevelt’s 1933 Agriculture Adjustment Act– the first Farm Bill, that ensured farmers a fair price. In their early years, cooperatives truly had the best interests of their farmer members at heart. But as some cooperatives grew into national powerhouses and many small local cooperatives went out of business, farmers felt the big cooperatives looked more like corporations than the small cooperative cheese factories or local feed mills that they grew up with, growth seemed more important than the collective good of the farmers. In a recent piece in Time magazine Land O’ Lakes CEO Beth Ford voiced her concern at the continuing loss of farmers, low commodity prices and declining farm income which dropped 25% from 2022 to 2024. Estimates put median farm income for 2025 at -$328. It’s not a new phenomenon, according to USDA data, the average US dairy farm turned a profit twice between 2000 and 2021. She mentions that farmers are getting older, with more farmers over the age of 75 than under the age of 35— no wonder, not many 20 or 30 somethings would take a job knowing they would probably be working for a negative income while slowly loosing their equity. Still, kudos to Beth Ford for at least pointing out some of the problems farmers have always faced, —basically an up and down cycle of good years and bad, with luck, enough good years to keep going, but never enough good years to be consistently profitable. But, there is more to the story of Land O’ Lakes. Most agribusiness CEO’s (while collecting their seven figure salaries) and their well compensated boards of directors, move their business model towards more growth and advise farmers to adopt more “efficient farming practices” meaning a shift to fewer, but larger farms that can afford the capital investments required to stay in business as markets, credit and infrastructure favor growth. So, while lamenting the loss of so many farms and farmers, Land O’ Lakes, through their own business model of consolidation has promoted this trend. “As agricultural markets consolidate, competition lessens, meaning producers and consumers have fewer options”. “Milk producers historically organized into co-ops to counterbalance concentrated power among buyers, but today, the largest co-ops, such as Dairy Farmers of America and Land O’ Lakes, prey off of small-scale producers they’re supposed to protect and strike arrangements with massive milk processors, like Dean Foods, that result in additional wealth transfers from farmers to their own executives”. While farm income has continued to drop, one of Ms. Ford’s solutions, —robust trade, apparently hasn’t raised farm incomes either. The US has promoted liberalized international trade of agricultural commodities for over 50 years, and even more aggressively since the 1996 farm bill that wanted to “get the government out of the marketplace”, yet farmers still can’t make a living and “get big or get out” is accepted as inevitable. Despite their squashing of competition in the domestic dairy sector, Land O’ Lakes has established a “strategic partnership” with the worlds largest dairy exporter, New Zealand based Fonterra. Apparently importing New Zealand cream cheese, non-dairy butter spread etc, will help US dairy farmers? Cooperatives are supposed to work for the best interests of their farmer owners, so it’s also unclear why a CEO and the cooperative board would think that engaging in illegal activities would be in the best interests the cooperative in general, specifically, its farmers. Yet they did, resulting in the price-fixing lawsuits and the ensuing settlements in dairy and in poultry for a total of $297 million. I doubt the farmer owners voted to enter into these scandals, but they paid for them. So, as mentioned, when cooperatives get too big, they often begin to act like a corporation, not a cooperative. Ms. Ford finally notes that “As private equity firms have become financial buyers of farmland, consolidation trends are changing. In Iowa alone, 20 million of its 30 million acres of farmland are set to transition. When farms are owned by firms, not families, communities wither. Contract farming does not plant community roots”. An odd comment for someone who has held a seat on the Board of Directors of BlackRock, an investment firm with considerable holdings in US farmland, agribusiness corporations and recently in Ukrainian farmland. While she stated that she was “honored to join this impactful organization” her resignation a year later, “was not a result of any disagreement with the Company, the Company’s management or the Board”, — so, she was part of their investment strategy and apparently did not disagree with it. Money and power can corrupt and cooperatives, can become that which they sought to oppose. Jim Goodman is a dairy farmer from Wonewoc, Wisconsin.

Shares in three of the “Magnificent Seven” — Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta — moved in different directions in after-hours trading after they released their third-quarter results. The earnings once again underscored how artificial intelligence continues to dominate Big Tech’s growth story and investor sentiment. (Source: Reuters) Alphabet’s shares surged 6.2% after the Google parent beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue. Both its core advertising business and its cloud computing unit showed steady growth. The company also raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion, far above earlier projections of around $80 billion. Microsoft’s stock fell 3.4% in extended trading even after posting blockbuster growth in its cloud-computing business, which pushed its quarterly revenue past expectations. The results showed that businesses are still spending aggressively on AI services despite concerns about a potential bubble. Analysts noted that Microsoft’s heavy AI investments are now starting to deliver meaningful returns. Meta’s shares dropped more than 8% after the company reported a $16 billion one-time charge in the third quarter related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The social media giant also said its capital expenditure next year would be “notably larger” than in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading an AI talent hiring spree and plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in massive AI data centres for superintelligence. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the results were a mixed bag for markets. “The good reaction in Alphabet offsets Microsoft’s uninspiring outcome and Meta’s surprise tax loss,” he said, adding that the stock moves were mostly within expected volatility ranges, with Microsoft’s reaction relatively muted. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the latest earnings confirm that there is no sign of a slowdown in the AI capital spending boom. The firm noted that the combined capital expenditure of the three companies rose by $14 billion quarter-on-quarter, or more than 22%, maintaining the same pace as the previous quarter and up 88% from a year ago. Despite the mixed share price reactions, the overall message is clear — AI remains the centrepiece of Big Tech’s long-term strategy. While short-term costs are weighing on profitability, investors continue to bet that these massive infrastructure investments will yield significant payoffs in the years ahead.

Stablecoin leader Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially launched its Arc testnet with VISA, Mastercard and other major partners, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as the “economic operating system for the internet.” Related Reading: Solana Price Set For Double-Digit Rally Above $230: Analyst Reveals How To Spot Next Move The testnet already counts over 100 major participants from finance, technology, and payments, including, as mentioned, Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Coinbase, all collaborating to bridge the gap between TradFi and the on-chain economy. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. Arc’s design centers on USDC as the native gas token, offering predictable dollar-based transaction fees and sub-second finality, features that make it uniquely appealing for regulated financial operations. Arc’s debut underscores a growing institutional appetite for blockchain infrastructure that balances regulatory compliance with decentralized programmability. Participants such as Apollo, BNY Mellon, and State Street join payment titans and fintech leaders in testing Arc’s capabilities. Circle has also enlisted developer partners like Alchemy, Chainlink, and Anthropic, while Coinbase and Uniswap are providing liquidity support. The network integrates optional privacy controls to ensure compliance with data-protection standards while enabling transparency for audits and settlements. This balance is crucial for large financial institutions exploring tokenized assets, real-time settlements, and programmable payments. In a significant regional development, South Korean firm BDACS announced it will issue its Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW1) on Circle’s Arc blockchain, a move aimed at expanding South Korea’s regulated stablecoin presence on the global stage. While Circle currently oversees Arc’s testnet operations, the company plans to transition toward community-governed decentralization in the future. Compliance partners like Elliptic are already integrating monitoring tools to strengthen transparency across the ecosystem. Industry analysts view Arc as Circle’s most ambitious project yet, a move that could reshape how banks, fintechs, and enterprises conduct cross-border payments and tokenized finance.

October 29, 2025 23:00 ET | Source: Aqua Labs Investment LLC Aqua Labs Investment LLC With $20 Million Global Startup Program And Summit Leadership in Dubai DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Labs, the emerging UAE-based Web3 investment group, has reinforced its commitment to the nation’s Economic Vision 2030 through its leadership role at the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy and Brand Excellence Summit. The event was held from 23 to 28 October 2025, at Palazzo Versace in Dubai. Organised by MOVA, the next-generation modular blockchain for global payments, and Minax, the real-world asset (RWA) platform, the summit celebrated the convergence of technology, art, and enterprise in driving the next phase of global economic transformation. The event convened senior representatives from the UAE Ministry of Economy & Tourism, the World Bank, the Private Office of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, Bithumb and Palm Promax Investment, alongside leading investors and innovators. Speakers included Dr Peter Knez, former Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock; Dr Sara Al Mashjari; Representatives of the Promotion and Investment Center for Burkina Faso and Partners (CPIB) in the UAE; Board Members of Promax Group; and representatives from the UN headquarters of AACID - ECOSOC UN; Wael Muhalsen, CEO of MOVA; and Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs. The participation of Aqua Labs, an innovative new player, at the summit followed the recent launch of its $20 million Startup Support Program. The program was unveiled in October 2025 in Abu Dhabi and invites founders worldwide to apply for funding, mentorship, and access to Web3 infrastructure designed to accelerate real-world adoption of blockchain, AI, and digital finance technologies. The program also underscores Aqua Labs’ nascent mission to empower visionary entrepreneurs and position the UAE as a global launchpad for next-generation innovation. At the summit, Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs, said: “We are honored to have supported the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit and to have given the opening address. Vision 2030 is a celebration of the convergence of technology, art, and real-world assets. We brought together visionary leaders, pioneering brands, and innovators with a shared goal: to transform traditional industries through blockchain-powered infrastructure and global asset tokenization. “Too often, when people hear the word ‘blockchain,’ they think of volatility, speculation, or fringe technologies. That perception is outdated. Blockchain represents excellence and virtue, a framework for trust in the digital world. By embracing it, we can reimagine industries, unlock new creative potential, and enable real-world value to flow seamlessly across borders. We are not just imagining the future, we are creating it.” Aqua Labs Investment LLC recently launched in Abu Dhabi as a licensed entity under the Department of Economic Development, serving as the operational arm of the Aqua1 Foundation. Its next-generation mandate is to develop infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization, AI-powered financial systems, and compliant blockchain ecosystems that connect sovereign and institutional capital with digital finance innovation. Through partnerships with sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, and global technology leaders, Aqua Labs is building a transparent and scalable framework for the next generation of financial systems – one capable of bringing trillions in real-world assets on-chain while fostering liquidity, resilience, and inclusion across markets.

Full Content:
Tether backs USDT with $135B in Treasuries, becoming a major player in global liquidity markets. It prompted Tether to launch USA₮, a compliant dollar-backed token tailored for U.S. regulations. Yes, but USDC is gaining ground in transaction volume and institutional adoption. The rise of stablecoins is increasingly being felt beyond the digital asset market. Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, now backs its token supply with approximately $135 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, according to recent disclosures. That figure makes Tether the 17th largest U.S. debt holder globally, surpassing countries such as South Korea and nearing Brazil, as noted by Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino. The development underscores how dollar-pegged crypto assets have evolved into meaningful participants in global liquidity flows, particularly in the short-term bond market. This comes at a time when the stablecoin market is entering a new regulatory and competitive phase, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a clearer regulatory path for compliant stablecoins in the U.S. market. In response, Tether introduced USA₮, a dollar-backed token specifically designed to meet the new U.S. regulatory requirements. Rival issuer Circle, meanwhile, has been expanding partnerships and infrastructure placements, and overseas players like Japan’s JPYC are also scaling operations to tap into rising global stablecoin demand. At the transaction level, stablecoin usage remains massive. Visa’s on-chain analytics further show that stablecoins facilitated $6.4 trillion in total transfers over the past 30 days. While USDT typically leads market activity, October data illustrate a competitive shift. This is because USDC recorded approximately $669.15 billion in monthly transaction volume, slightly ahead of USDT’s $607.98 billion during the same period. The figures suggest that while USDT still dominates overall market share and circulation, USDC is gaining meaningful traction in payments and institutional pipelines. At the same time, Tether is expanding beyond stablecoins altogether. Tether Data, the company’s technology unit, recently announced the launch of QVAC Genesis I, a 41-billion-token synthetic dataset built to train science- and engineering-focused AI models. Alongside it, the firm introduced QVAC Workbench, an application that allows users to run AI models directly on local devices. However, AMBCrypto’s analysis shows USDT still leads the market with a 79% share in August 2025, but its dominance is slowly slipping as USDC gains ground. While USDC offers stronger transparency and fully liquid reserves overseen by BlackRock, USDT’s mix of assets, ranging from Treasuries to Bitcoin and commodities, raises more debate. However, the 10th October flash de-peg proved that stability isn’t just about reserve composition. This is because USDT briefly traded above $1 while USDC dipped, highlighting that trust in stablecoins now depends as much on real-world performance as the assets backing them.

Riley Moore, R-W.Va. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) George Caldwell / @GCaldwell_news George Caldwell is a journalism fellow at The Daily Signal. Send an email to George. Members of Congress come from all walks of life, but a number of those lawmakers have backgrounds as state financial officers—auditors and treasurers, who determine how states invest and employ their funds. Some prominent Republicans say that background of conservative money management has made them uniquely motivated to curtail Congress’ spending. On Wednesday, the State Financial Officers Foundation, a network of conservative state financial officers, gathered for a panel discussion in Washington to discuss how alumni are applying their experience on the state level toward fiscally conservative legislation in Congress. Rep. Riley Moore is a freshman in the House, but is already in a place of prominence as a member of the Appropriations Committee, which makes decisions on federal spending. Moore, a nephew of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told The Daily Signal that he draws on his experience as state treasurer of West Virginia in his work. “It was hugely beneficial to me when I was making my case to get on Appropriations. I’m the only freshman Republican or Democrat on Appropriations,” he told The Daily Signal. “Had I not had that state financial officer’s background, I’m not sure I’d be on that committee.” During his tenure as treasurer, Moore pursued pro-natural gas policies, such as divesting state pension funds from BlackRock for its use of environmental, social, and governance criteria in making investments. West Virginia’s economy has historically relied on coal and natural gas. He also worked with state legislators on passing legislation to blacklist financial institutions from doing business with the West Virginia government “if their policies conflicted with or boycotted the energy industry.” In Congress, Moore has left his mark on the ongoing appropriations process in a similar way, introducing an amendment into the House’s financial services funding bill to clamp down on credit-rating agencies using ESG criteria, a policy he says has negatively affected his state’s bond rating. As West Virginia’s State Treasurer, I was the first elected official in America to divest my state’s tax dollars from BlackRock that leveraged ESG policies to destroy the fossil fuel industries of my state.Today, my amendment ensures that rating agencies cannot use ESG to… pic.twitter.com/BgXR4PXLbH His amendment would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report on which agencies use ESG criteria in order to assist Congress in addressing the negative effects on states’ finances. Moore also comes from a state that, like many others, has a balanced-budget amendment, meaning the state legislature has to make tough decisions on funding each year, and the state treasurer works within the parameters of those budgets. He says that drives him toward a fiscally conservative approach. “At a state level, obviously we’re always doing more with less. That’s what we do. Right here [in Washington], it’s kind of the opposite,” he said. “I think being able to bring that perspective to the appropriation process is certainly something that’s beneficial, not just to the committee, but I think the country as a whole.” Rep. Jimmy Patronis similarly said it has been a culture shock coming from Florida, which has a balanced-budget amendment, to Congress, which has not passed a balanced budget in a quarter of a century. Patronis was the chief financial officer of Florida before being elected to Congress in a special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. “The states have been able to be more disciplined, but it’s taken constitutional amendments in those states in order to force some of those policies to be the law of the land,” Patronis told The Daily Signal. “Could we do that in Washington? It’s hard. One thing I’ve learned in Washington: People do enjoy spending money, and I come from a background being a small-business person, where I’m always trying to find ways to create profit, not to spend money,” Patronis said, adding: I’m grateful for what I’ve brought up here to Washington, what I’ve learned, and just hopefully, we can find enough like minds where we can move the needle. One of the most prominent alumni of the State Financial Officers Foundation is Rep. Ron Estes. Estes serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all bills related to taxation originate. He points to his time as Kansas state treasurer, working with limited resources, as a valuable experience. “I think a lot of what you look at, just from a standpoint of what’s the role of government, you look at small, limited government and being able to provide people the opportunity to do what they want to without government dictating what to do,” Estes told The Daily Signal of his experience as state treasurer. He added, “There are some functions and features that a government should do, but let’s make sure that they’re efficient and effective in terms of how we set up them up, how we make them work, how we make them apply to people.” The State Financial Officers Foundation is led by Marlo Oaks, the Utah state treasurer. Oaks told The Daily Signal that he continues to value the connections between the organization and its alumni on Capitol Hill. “It’s really nice to have folks that have been in this role who understand what we’re doing at the state now at the federal level,” said Oaks. But he added that, despite the important action in Washington, officials on the state level play a major role themselves in determining governance. “They’ve clearly played a very significant role during the Biden administration, pushing back against the whole-of-government approach. That was one of the greatest over-exercisings of power in the history of this country … to push an agenda on this country.” Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

The team at Coopers Beach Butchery were the only Northland butchers to take out an overall category prize at this year's Dunninghams Great NZ Sausage Competition. Hand-crafted sausages are smoking past pricey steak as the barbecue go-to this summer – and Northland’s butchers are producing some of the best in the business. The Northern Advocate recently highlighted Omak Meats’ silver medal in the pork category of the 2025 Dunningham’s Great New Zealand Sausage Competition, but has since caught wind that several other Northland butchers also earned top honours. Mangawhai Meat Shop – also known as Klink’s Family Deli – earned two golds for its Free-range Pork and Fennel and Bolognese with Parmesan sausages, and a silver for its Chicken Carbonara. The wins bring the shop’s overall medal tally to 23, including a previous Supreme Award, over the 13 years it’s been entering the national competition. Owner Dan Klink said he was proud that a regional shop with a staff of only five could do so well in a competition that also drew entries from the country’s biggest players. “With over 800 entries from over 110 stores around New Zealand, it’s getting harder and harder to stand out from the rest, but my team and I keep focusing on quality and innovation.” He said sausages were fast becoming the new barbecue staple as meat prices soar. The butchers agreed that beef and lamb prices had increased at least 30% in the past year alone. “People are looking for value, and sausages offer that. They’re more affordable than steak, but when they’re handcrafted like ours, they’re still packed with flavour and quality.” Klink said there might even be a special Christmas snag in the works, possibly incorporating a cranberry and bacon stuffing that the store also sells. Coopers Beach Butchery was the only overall Category Champions in Northland, winning the highest accolade in the pork section – the same category in which Omak Meats won silver. Coopers Beach butcher Gavin Cameron said it was his first time entering the competition since taking ownership of the shop five years ago. However, his winning Blackrock Pork Sausage - named after his previous Auckland business - was the same recipe for which he’d won the Supreme Award back in 2007. “It’s a nod to where we came from and what we’ve built since,” Cameron said. “We’re proud of what we do, and it’s great to see Northland butchers getting the recognition they deserve.” Cameron said the value of a local butcher went far beyond the impersonal experiences of supermarket shopping or a meal kit designed by someone else. “We talk to our customers, we know what they like, and we can help them make the most of what they’re buying,” he said. Butchers could help customers plan a whole meal, still offered cuts supermarkets had long since dropped, and could custom-make products to order. This year was the toughest economically for the industry and for customers, Cameron said. A good sausage was like having a good steak, and at just over $20 kg, the price of two was usually between $5 to $6 - much more affordable than a piece of steak, Cameron said. “And, if the sausage is an award-winning one, handcrafted, you’re going to really taste the difference between it and a massively processed one," he said. Cameron also tied for a bronze medal with Webster Family Butchery in Dargaville, both being recognised for their Roast Lamb and Caramelised Onion recipe. The Dargaville business’s working-owner Kyle Webster, said sausage sales had surged since he reopened the butcher shop about four years ago. “Our sausage sales have increased, probably 50% since we started here, because they’re still affordable when steak and lamb are so expensive.” Webster said he was developing a Wild West Kumara sausage – a mix of beef, spices and kumara – which sells out weekly. While it wasn’t a placegetter in this year’s competition, Webster believed he was on to a future winner. “The problem is we’re so busy here making sausages, we don’t get enough time to actually, you know, tweak and test and add – but I’m going to make time next year," he said. Sarah Curtis is a news reporter for the Northern Advocate, focusing on a wide range of issues. She has nearly 20 years’ experience in journalism, most of which she spent court reporting in Gisborne and on the East Coast. Businesses on Cove Rd saw a surge when SH1 closed through the Brynderwyns.

Title: Markets Tumble After Fed Lowers Interest Rates—But Powell Won’t Promise Another Cut

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates for the second straight month, but the broader market reacted negatively after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested an additional cut may not come later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Fed Governor Stephen Miran were the lone dissenting votes: Miran again pushed for a half-point reduction after dissenting in September’s vote, while Schmid preferred the Fed not lower rates at all. In its statement, the FOMC held its review of the labor market, which notes that “job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August.” The Fed appeared to acknowledge the ongoing federal government shutdown, adding “available indicators” suggest the U.S. economy has expanded at a moderate pace and that inflation has “moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement that policymakers had “strongly differing views” about how to proceed in the FOMC’s last meeting in December. A further reduction to interest rates is “not a foregone conclusion,” Powell said, “Far from it.” Powell noted that while some government data has been delayed, public and private sector data that have remained available suggest employment and inflation have “not changed much” since the FOMC met last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 0.2%) and S&P 500 (0.3%) dropped on the day after Powell’s statements, paring back earlier gains on the day largely driven by Nvidia’s record-setting surge, which has held up the tech-heavy Nasdaq (up 0.1%) so far. Boeing (4.3%) headlined declines across the Dow, followed by Nike (3.1%), UnitedHealth Group (3%) and Home Depot (2%). Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues. Reports released from several firms and economists in recent weeks suggest the labor market has continued to deteriorate, suggesting the FOMC could have data to support an additional cut. Whether Trump names his pick to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May 2026, by the end of the year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said five candidates are under consideration for the role, including Fed governors Waller, Michelle Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. Bessent said he would present a list of candidates to Trump shortly after Thanksgiving.

Title: Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rates Again
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/10/29/federal-reserve-lowers-interest-rates-again/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T18:04:57Z

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates for the second straight month, but the broader market reacted negatively after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested an additional cut may not come later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Fed Governor Stephen Miran were the lone dissenting votes: Miran again pushed for a half-point reduction after dissenting in September’s vote, while Schmid preferred the Fed not lower rates at all. In its statement, the FOMC held its review of the labor market, which notes that “job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August.” The Fed appeared to acknowledge the ongoing federal government shutdown, adding “available indicators” suggest the U.S. economy has expanded at a moderate pace and that inflation has “moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement that policymakers had “strongly differing views” about how to proceed in the FOMC’s last meeting in December. A further reduction to interest rates is “not a foregone conclusion,” Powell said, “Far from it.” Powell noted that while some government data has been delayed, public and private sector data that have remained available suggest employment and inflation have “not changed much” since the FOMC met last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 0.2%) and S&P 500 (0.3%) dropped on the day after Powell’s statements, paring back earlier gains on the day largely driven by Nvidia’s record-setting surge, which has held up the tech-heavy Nasdaq (up 0.1%) so far. Boeing (4.3%) headlined declines across the Dow, followed by Nike (3.1%), UnitedHealth Group (3%) and Home Depot (2%). Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues. Reports released from several firms and economists in recent weeks suggest the labor market has continued to deteriorate, suggesting the FOMC could have data to support an additional cut. Whether Trump names his pick to succeed Powell, whose term expires in May 2026, by the end of the year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said five candidates are under consideration for the role, including Fed governors Waller, Michelle Bowman, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. Bessent said he would present a list of candidates to Trump shortly after Thanksgiving.

Title: Ethereum Foundation rolls out new institution-focused site amid Wall Street’s crypto push

About us Copy link Wall Street is embracing crypto like never before. But financial institutions may struggle to know where to begin. The Ethereum Foundation is aiming to make this easier for them with the launch of a new website. On Wednesday, the organisation, which helps develop and maintain the Ethereum blockchain, launched the new online resource to help guide firms looking to integrate the blockchain into their businesses. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” a post from the foundation said, adding that the site will help guide businesses adopting Ethereum and showcase how the ecosystem is building a new financial system. 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 The site highlights institutional use cases for Ethereum, including stablecoins, the tokenisation of real-world assets like bonds, and decentralised financial applications. It also contains statistics on the blockchain’s use, and information on firms like BlackRock, Visa, and eToro, who are already experimenting with Ethereum. Ethereum is the biggest blockchain for DeFi, with some $118 billion worth of deposits to more than one thousand protocols. It also hosts more than half of the $308 billion stablecoin market. But the blockchain’s stewards — namely the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation — have previously faced criticism for not doing enough to support institutional adoption on the blockchain compared to its rivals. The move comes amid a crypto land grab among the paragons of traditional finance who are looking to leverage blockchain technology following landmark legislation being approved this summer. On Tuesday, banking giant Citi announced a partnership with US crypto exchange Coinbase to foster the adoption of stablecoins. The firms plan to build stablecoin on- and off-ramps, streamline settlement, and make digital dollars flow 24/7. Over the past week, Zelle and Western Union have also revealed plans to integrate stablecoins into their operations. Seeing the growing institutional interest, the Ethereum Foundation has sought to make the blockchain more attractive for financial firms looking to integrate the technology. Last year, the foundation, along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, funded research into Wall Street’s interest in Ethereum through Etherealize, a startup focused on integrating traditional finance with the blockchain. “Institutions need someone to be the face of the organisation that is representing Ethereum,” Tomasz Stańczak, one of the Ethereum Foundation’s co-directors, told DL News in July. Etherealize has bold plans for adoption. In September, CEO Vivek Raman told DL News of his ambition to onboard the $16 trillion mortgage market to Ethereum. “The whole fixed income space of really esoteric objects, such as mortgages, is a huge design space to tokenise those natively,” Raman said. In addition to courting institutions, representatives from Etherealize met with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force in May to discuss how the regulator could accommodate tokenisation of stocks and bonds on the blockchain.

Title: Investment Bank Mizuho Says Visa Is Becoming the ‘Stablecoin of Stablecoins’
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/29/investment-bank-mizuho-says-visa-is-becoming-the-stablecoin-of-stablecoins
Time Published: 2025-10-29T17:05:20Z
Full Content:
Japanese investment bank Mizuho called Visa (V) the “stablecoin of stablecoins,” arguing that the payments giant has become a core part of the global stablecoin infrastructure. Visa’s expanding network of stablecoin-linked card programs, now over 130 in more than 40 countries, with spending up fourfold year-on-year, gives it a central role in blockchain-based payments, according to the Wednesday report. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. Tether's USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC. The bank has an outperform rating on Visa shares with a $425 price target. The stock was 1% lower, around $343.30, at publication time. Visa could emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of stablecoin adoption, helped by momentum from the GENIUS Act and its long-running Visa Direct initiative, analysts Dan Dolev and Alexander Jenkins wrote. Visa Direct has grown about 50% annually since 2016 and now accounts for roughly 15%–20% of global debit volume, or over $1.1 trillion, they said. With a growing array of stablecoins, from USDT and USDC to PayPal’s PYUSD and various central bank projects, the analysts said a centralized hub like Visa offers a powerful competitive advantage. The analysts also pointed to Visa’s move to let banks mint and burn their own stablecoins using its tokenized asset platform, suggesting that individual stablecoins such as USDC are becoming interchangeable, and that networks like Visa or Mastercard (MA) will ultimately capture the most value. Visa currently supports four stablecoins on its platform, USDG, PYUSD, EURC and USDC. Mizuho said this is only the beginning. As stablecoins become more commoditized, the bank sees Visa’s role as the “network of networks” or “stablecoin of stablecoins” as a key long-term growth driver. The bank's analysts reiterated its view that Circle (CRCL), the issuer of USDC, is overvalued, maintaining an underperform rating and an $84 price target. Circle shares fell 3.45%, trading around $131.37 at publication time.

Title: Family speak of their horror as two men jailed for Kieran Quilligan murder in Cork

A man whose son was beaten to death before his body was dumped in a woodland has said the murderers did not show “one bit of remorse for what they did” despite listening to “horror stories” in court during their trial. The family of Kieran Quilligan (47) delivered victim impact statements at the Central Criminal Court in Cork on Wednesday as Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (28) were sentenced to life imprisonment by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford. Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023 and January 29th, 2024. However, a jury found them both guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan’s mother, Catherine O’Flynn, his father Stephen Quilligan, and his partner, Colette O’Driscoll, on Wednesday told the court how Mr Quilligan’s death had affected them. Ms O’Flynn said the family clung on to the hope that Kieran was still alive after he disappeared from his flat in Cork city on September 1st, 2023, and that it was all just a bad dream from which they would one day wake up. “I remember the months unfolding. How could I forget? Each day the weather conditions were getting worse – it felt like there were never so many storms. I’d stare out the windows thinking ‘God love him – he is out there in all this’, while still clinging to the hope he was still alive," she said. “We were living in a world of loss, fear and hope until January 29th, 2024 when Kieran’s skeletal remains were found. Our hearts were broken in a million pieces – our worst nightmare come true,” added Ms O’Flynn, who said that if her love could have saved her son, he would still be alive. Stephen Quilligan said they knew foul play had been involved in Kieran’s disappearance, but it was not until they sat through the murder trial and heard the evidence that they realised the full horror of what had happened. “We were shocked, angry, in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened,” he said. “For the last three weeks we have sat here listening to horror stories about my son and the two defendants didn’t show one bit of remorse for what they did.” He thanked An Garda Síochána for not giving up when searching for Kieran and treating him “like a human being”. Ms O’Driscoll said she adored Kieran and they had been told before his disappearance that they were to be housed together. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long-awaited castle,” she said. Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan outlined the background to the murder. She said Long and Taylor killed Mr Quilligan in retaliation for an incident earlier on September 1st, 2023 when Mr Quilligan and another man had robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork city centre. The three men were known to each other as they were users of heroin and crack cocaine. Taylor lured Mr Quilligan from his flat on Anderson’s Quay to St Finbarr’s Place, where he was attacked by him and Long before being bundled into the boot of a Toyota Rav 4. Gardaí were able to link the vehicle to Long and tracked it driving to the Little Island area, where they dumped Mr Quilligan’s body off a farmyard. Gardaí tracked the vehicle returning there three days later, when the defendants collected and moved Mr Quilligan’s body. Garda were able to track the vehicle’s movements to Whitewell, Rostellan near Midleton. A search of the area by a cadaver dog on January 29th, 2024 led them to Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains, which had been dumped in a gravel bag in low lying forestry. Det Garda O’Sullivan said Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster was unable to give a cause of death because of the long interval between Mr Quilligan’s death and the postmortem. She testified that many of Mr Quilligan’s fractures were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”.

Major U.S. equities indexes extended their record-setting run Wednesday afternoon ahead of an expected decision from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all climbed to all-time highs. AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA) helped push the indexes higher after an event where it highlighted a flurry of partnerships. The shares climbed to a fresh high that lifted the chipmaker's market capitalization above $5 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve that milestone. Caterpillar (CAT) shares surged to an all-time high as sales of AI power-generation equipment helped the maker of big machines beat earnings and revenue estimates. Teradyne (TER) shares also took off after the semiconductor and robotics firm posted better-than-expected results and offered an upbeat outlook as it benefited from AI demand. Fiserv (FI) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the financial tech provider missed profit and sales estimates, slashed its outlook, and shook up its executive team. Shares of Etsy (ETSY) tumbled after the online marketplace also announced a leadership change, with CEO Josh Silverman stepping down at the end of the year to be replaced by President and Chief Growth Officer Kruti Patel Goyal. Hormel Foods (HRL) shares fell after the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, and other packaged foods warned current-quarter results could be hurt by price pressures, bird flu, and a fire at a peanut butter production plant. Oil and gold futures advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro and pound, but lost ground to the yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

Title: Nvidia's market capitalization hits $5.12 trillion — AI powerhouse is the first company in history to hit seismic milestone

The most expensive company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The market capitalization of Nvidia passed the $5 trillion mark on Wednesday, following a host of potentially lucrative deals and projects the company announced at its GPU Technology Conference event on Tuesday. The company's stock price continues to be driven by the broad interest towards artificial intelligence and Nvidia's unique position in the AI supply chain that now spans from humble chips for inference to gigawatt-scale data centers for massive AI training. At its GTC 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., Nvidia made a number of announcements that could potentially bring tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in revenue to the company in the coming years. Among the highlights announced by Nvidia are reference designs for gargantuan gigawatt-scale AI data centers that will let newcomers to build new AI factories using Nvidia blueprints and hardware; partnership with Palantir to build an integrated stack for operational AI; the deal with Uber to use Nvidia's Level 4 AGX Drive Hyperion platform for its fleet of autonomous robotaxis as well as adoption of the same platform by Mercedes, Stellantis, Volvo, Lucid, and Foxconn; NVQLink technology to attach Nvidia GPUs to quantum computers; partnership to build AI-RAN products with Nokia; contracts to build seven AI supercomputers for the U.S. government; and plans to build AI-native 6G networks in the U.S. together with partners. The new announcements place Nvidia at the center of the large-scale AI supply chain, which will drive demand for the company's hardware and software solutions. Nvidia's AI platform comprises numerous products, including GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, NVLink switches, and Ethernet and Infiniband solutions. If one wants to build an Nvidia-based cluster or data center for AI, they will inevitably procure plenty of Nvidia-designed hardware and software to build it and operate it. While for now Nvidia supplies AI hardware to companies like AWS, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and xAI, in the coming years, it is going to expand its total addressable market to both established players across industries (e.g., Lilly is already building its own AI data center) and new players that have yet to become significant in their realms. Even established companies are increasing their demands for AI GPUs. For example, Nvidia supplied about four million Hopper-based AI GPUs throughout the architecture's active lifetime, and shipments of Blackwell stand at six million units now and yet have to peak. With new participants entering the AI field, sales of Nvidia's hardware are poised to skyrocket. Nvidia's unique position in the growing AI supply chain places it well above other semiconductor and high-tech companies as far as market capitalization is concerned. The company at press time cost over a trillion dollars more than Apple ($4.011 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.995 trillion), nearly two trillion dollars more than Alphabet ($3.257 trillion), and two times more than Amazon ($2.444 billion). Interestingly, TSMC — the key supplier to Nvidia that produces all of its silicon — now has a market capitalization of $1.582 trillion, whereas ASML — the key supplier to TSMC — now costs $416.5 billion. Market capitalization of Nvidia's traditional rivals — AMD and Intel — stands at $429 billion and $197 billion, respectively.

Unprecedented demand for the company’s AI chips have propelled the company’s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday’s open, comes just three months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation. The company’s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker’s meteoric rise. Boosting Nvidia’s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China’s market to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock rose after CEO Jensen Huang presented a vision of Nvidia’s future in which the company’s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company’s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump. Nvidia’s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it’s pouring into other major players. On Tuesday, another tech giant — Apple — breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It’s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars’ worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in beleaguered chipmaker Intel. But the circular spending spree, paired with the industry’s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst. Still, Nvidia executives said during the company’s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income. All you need to know about Ghana's new vehicle number plates | BizTech: Copyright © 1994 - 2025 GhanaWeb.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. With NVIDIA rising 11% in a week, it is a good time to reassess its position against its competitors. Regularly evaluating alternatives is fundamental to a robust investment strategy. Here’s how NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock compares with its rivals in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margin. To provide some context, NVIDIA offers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets worldwide, alongside a strategic partnership with Kroger Co. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a broader, diversified strategy. Time for a quiz: Over the last five years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed — the S&P 500, the S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework tilts the odds in your favor. Why does this matter? NVDA just recorded an 11% increase in a week — comparing it with peers provides insight into stock performance, valuation, and financials — determining whether it is truly excelling, trailing, and ultimately — can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to evaluate if NVIDIA remains a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally — investigate how the stock has fallen and rebounded in the past through the NVDA Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. Revenue Growth Comparison Operating Margin Comparison PE Ratio Comparison While peer comparisons are important, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that encompasses all three — the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia’s $1 Billion Bet Turns Nokia Into The New AI Contender

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nokia stock (NYSE: NOK) is back in the spotlight. The Finnish telecom giant’s shares surged over 20% this week after Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a $1 billion investment for approximately a 2.9% stake, forming a new alliance to develop AI-driven networking and 6G infrastructure. For investors, this is not merely a fleeting headline. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate a company often viewed as a legacy player. With a market capitalization of $42 billion, Nokia delivers mobile, fixed, and cloud network solutions from 2G to 5G, and now, it’s seeking to position itself as a link between telecom and AI infrastructure. Let’s analyze how it compares. Nevertheless, if you seek upward potential with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has substantially outshined its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, minimizing significant fluctuations, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at – After A Hot Run For Gold, Will Stocks Take The Lead Again? At first glance, Nokia does not seem to be a bargain. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41x, compared to the S&P 500’s 24. Its price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios — at 2.2 and 33.3, respectively — also surpass market averages. This indicates that optimism has likely set in. The Nvidia partnership may warrant a premium, but the market is evidently betting on strong execution ahead. For investors, this implies that the narrative now rests on whether Nokia can provide sustained growth in a sector characterized by fierce competition and slim margins. Nokia’s growth record has been inconsistent. Over the last three years, revenue actually declined at an average rate of nearly 6% per year, significantly trailing the S&P 500’s positive trend. The positive news? Indicators of improvement are evident. In the last twelve months, Nokia’s revenue increased by almost 6%, reaching $20 billion, with its most recent quarter showing an 11.6% year-over-year increase. This upturn, bolstered by AI-related momentum and increased network demand, is one of the reasons the stock has attracted new investor interest. However, the more significant challenge will be sustainability. Can Nokia transform temporary order surges into long-term, profitable growth? That remains an unanswered question. Despite increasing sales, Nokia’s profitability lags significantly behind competitors. Operating margins hover around 3.7%, compared to the S&P 500’s 18.7%. Its net income margin, approximately 4.7%, presents a similar narrative — respectable for a hardware-heavy industry, but far from robust. Cash flow generation is somewhat stronger, with a 9.6% operating cash flow margin, or about $1.9 billion over the previous year. Still, Nokia must significantly increase margins if it aims to be recognized as a genuine AI-infrastructure contender rather than just a cyclical telecom supplier. Where Nokia excels is in its balance sheet strength. Debt stands at only $4.1 billion with a modest debt-to-equity ratio close to 10%. The company also has $6.1 billion in cash, approximately 17% of total assets, which is considerably higher than the average S&P 500 peer. In a capital-intensive sector, that financial cushion is crucial. It provides Nokia the capacity to invest in AI networking, support research and development, and manage downturns without incurring major dilution or distress. Nokia’s stock history illustrates a narrative of vulnerability in the face of market shocks. It plummeted 54% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn, significantly steeper than the S&P 500’s 25% drop, and it has not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels. The crash of 2008 was even harsher, with the stock dropping nearly 79% and never regaining those heights. On a positive note, Nokia rebounded swiftly from the 2020 pandemic sell-off, regaining losses in just 81 days, outpacing the broader market. However, overall, the company's crisis resilience has fallen short, serving as a reminder that investor sentiment can shift dramatically when fundamentals weaken. Nokia’s new collaboration with Nvidia could signify a pivotal moment, allowing the company to reposition itself as an AI-era infrastructure leader instead of a struggling telecom supplier. Nevertheless, the figures still narrate a mixed story: high valuation, uneven growth, thin margins, yet a robust balance sheet. For the time being, investors ought to approach this as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround. Nvidia’s billion-dollar endorsement provides Nokia with new credibility — but only consistent execution and margin enhancement will convert that promise into lasting value. You may wish to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks presents a flexible strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Google Parent Alphabet's Stock To Move After Earnings

Google parent Alphabet is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, with traders betting on a sizable move in the tech giant's stock. Options pricing suggests traders expect Alphabet (GOOGL) stock could move about 6% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size off Tuesday's close near $268 would push shares to about $283 at the high end, in what would represent a new all-time high for the stock, or drag them down to about $252, where they were last week. Alphabet shares posted modest gains in the range of 1% to 3% in the days after posting its results in three of the four past quarters. However, they tumbled 7% the day after the company released its fourth-quarter results in February, when the tech giant announced big spending plans for this year. As with many of its Magnificent 7 peers due to report this week, investors will be watching for Alphabet's progress with its AI goals, and anticipation of an abnormally large move in its stock could reflect either extreme optimism or pessimism heading into the earnings. Shares of Alphabet have added over 40% of their value in 2025, making it one of the best-performing Magnificent 7 stocks for the year so far, behind AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Still, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha calling it a "buy" compared to three neutral ratings, though the stock has already blown past their mean target of $254 with its recent gains. The tech giant is projected to report earnings per share of $2.26 for the third quarter on a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue to $99.9 billion, according to consensus estimates.

My tenure at these premier Wall Street firms exposed me to fundamental analysis, credit evaluation, and risk management practices, which directly translate into selecting quality dividend-paying companies. Having witnessed firsthand the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath—including the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, from which I was fortunately spared as I had left both firms by 2004—I developed a keen appreciation for balance sheet strength, sustainable payout ratios, and the importance of dividends as a stabilizing force during market turbulence. By analyzing cash flow generation, capital allocation strategies, and management quality, I can identify companies with durable competitive advantages and the financial discipline to maintain and grow their dividends through economic cycles. Early in my career, I realized that dividend investing is not merely an income strategy, but also a comprehensive framework for building wealth through companies that consistently return capital to shareholders while maintaining financial stability. Five top companies are the bedrock and pinnacle for dividend investors. All are the kind of stocks that growth and income investors can buy now, tomorrow, next week, or next year and hold for the long term. All are rated Buy at top Wall Street firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973 to 2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is the world’s fourth-largest telecommunications company, measured by revenue. The legacy telecommunications company has been undergoing a lengthy restructuring process while maintaining a solid dividend of 4.24%. Seventeen analysts have given the stock a Buy rating, indicating comprehensive Wall Street support. AT&T provides a range of telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. Its Communications segment offers wireless voice and data communications services. AT&T sells through its company-owned stores, agents, and third-party retail stores: AT&T also provides: Additionally, this segment provides residential customers with broadband fiber and legacy telephony voice communication services.

(NYSE: KO) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1892. It remains a top long-time holding of Warren Buffett, who owns a massive 400 million shares and pays a dependable 2.94% dividend.

Led by Coca-Cola, one of the world’s most valuable and recognizable brands, the company’s portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including: Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees, juices, and juice drinks. Through the world’s most extensive beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the company’s beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. It’s also important to remember that the company owns 16.7% of Monster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST), which continues to deliver big numbers. UBS has a Buy rating with an $80 target price. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) manages an industry-leading portfolio of resources and is one of the world’s largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies. The decline in oil prices presents investors with an excellent entry point, and they will likely seize the opportunity to secure a strong 3.48% dividend yield. Exxon is the world’s largest international integrated oil and gas company, exploring for and producing crude oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada/South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia/Oceania. The energy giant also manufactures and markets commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics, as well as specialty products. Additionally, the company transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products. Top Wall Street analysts expect the company to remain a key beneficiary in a stable oil price environment. Most remain very optimistic about the company’s sharp positive inflection in capital allocation strategy, particularly in the Upstream portfolio and its leverage to a further demand recovery. Exxon offers greater Downstream/Chemicals exposure than its peers. Exxon completed its purchase of oil shale giant Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock transaction valued at $59.5 billion in 2024.

Title: Netflix Stock To $500?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/netflix-stock-to-500/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T14:42:38Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) has shown remarkable performance, increasing by 45% in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately $1,100 for each share. This surge has been fueled by the company's efforts to tackle password sharing and the introduction of its advertising-supported streaming option, although the stock has experienced a minor sell-off in recent times. After reaching a peak of roughly $1,340 in June, it has declined due to Q3 earnings that fell short of expectations, resulting in Netflix revenues and margins coming in below projections. Despite the recent drop, the stock still trades at around 45 times the forecasted earnings. We think the stock faces significant downside risk at such high levels. With increasing macroeconomic uncertainties and indications that subscriber growth may decelerate, investors might be overlooking possible risks. In our opinion, the stock could decline drastically — potentially falling below $500 per share. A 50% correction may seem drastic, but it would not be without precedent. This has occurred before and could likely happen again. However, any potential correction would not necessarily arise from a breakdown in Netflix’s fundamentals, but rather from a recalibration of its valuation multiple as growth begins to stabilize. Investing in single stocks can be risky, yet there is significant value in utilizing a broader, diversified strategy. If you're looking for some upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) — HQ has outperformed its benchmark, a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is essential — consider what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you incorporated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ's performance metrics. Netflix's subscriber growth could eventually decelerate as significant measures like the crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported plans have typically been implemented across major markets. These initiatives were substantial strategic changes aimed at creating new revenue streams and enlarging the user base after growth stagnated following the pandemic. However, demand may have been pulled forward that might have otherwise emerged over the next few years, leading to softer subscriber additions in the future. The company’s intent to cease reporting subscriber figures from 2025 might also reflect internal expectations for slower growth ahead. In 2024 alone, Netflix added over 40 million subscribers, bringing its paid user count to nearly 302 million by the end of the year, marking a record annual increase that considerably propelled the stock’s upward trajectory. Growth was mainly stimulated by the crackdown on password sharing, which incentivized users to either purchase extra member access or create new accounts. Simultaneously, the ad-supported tier gained substantial traction, with Netflix reporting last quarter that it had over 94 million ad-supported users. While Netflix is becoming more efficient in monetizing its ads, subscriber growth has been a fundamental driver of the company’s expansion. With these significant growth levers now mostly exhausted, Netflix may find it challenging to maintain its present momentum, which could have repercussions on the stock’s performance. Economic uncertainty and rising costs could also pressure Netflix, which heavily relies on consumer spending. The introduction of tariffs on essential trading partners is already causing inflation in the U.S. to rise. This may decrease disposable income and, in turn, potentially weaken consumer spending. This situation could be detrimental for Netflix, which depends on discretionary income. Additionally, Netflix’s plans have become pricier, with its premium plan now priced at $25 a month and the standard HD plan recently increasing by $2.50 to $18 per month. This may result in a slowdown in new sign-ups. At the same time, Netflix’s content expenses are set to increase as it delves deeper into live sports programming, such as NFL games and WWE wrestling, which typically incur higher production and licensing costs. Although the recent decline in Q3 operating margin to 28% — against a predicted 31.5% — largely resulted from an unforeseen tax dispute in Brazil, margins may remain susceptible as spending pressures accumulate. For the entirety of 2025, Netflix now anticipates an operating margin of 29%, slightly down from its earlier forecast of 30%. NFLX stock has experienced slightly better performance compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent market downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on NFLX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go In A Market Crash presents a detailed analysis of how S&P stocks performed during and after prior market crashes. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2008 Global Financial Crisis But the risk isn’t confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider events like earnings reports, company updates, or outlook modifications. Check out NFLX Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from significant dips in the past. At the current share price of $1,100, Netflix trades at approximately 45 times consensus earnings for 2025 and around 34 times the consensus earnings for 2026, which is high compared to historical standards. In contrast, the stock was trading at approximately 20 times earnings in mid-2022. Although Netflix’s recent financial results have been robust, markets can be short-sighted, projecting short-term successes into the distant future. In Netflix’s situation, the prevailing assumption is that the company will sustain its strong sequence of subscriber acquisitions and likely grow revenues comfortably in double digits. Nevertheless, there’s a real chance that Netflix will soon witness a slowdown in growth, as the combined advantages of the password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers eventually stabilize, all while economic uncertainties continue to rise in the U.S. Essentially, the downside risk here lies less in Netflix’s business viability and more in the extent to which investors are prepared to pay for its next phase of slower, more mature growth. Worried about Netflix stock's high valuation? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks offered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

TWO MEN HAVE been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in scrubland in east Cork. A jury of ten men and two women found Luke Taylor (28) and Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan last week following a three-week trial at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Kieran Quilligan (47) was missing for five months when his remains were found in a ravine at Whitewell, Rostellan on 29 January 2024. He had suffered nineteen broken bones after being attacked with fists and a hammer-like object. Gardaí had brought a PSNI cadaver dog to an area of interest to the investigation in east Cork where they discovered the remains in a one tonne gravel bag. At a sentencing hearing in Cork today, Stephen Quilligan, father of the late Kieran Quilligan, said that the two perpetrators, whom he referred to as “monsters”, would never be forgiven for what they had done. Mr Quilligan said that he knew that there was foul play involved when his son disappeared without trace on 1 September 2023. “It all started for us two years ago and it has been a nightmare of our family ever since. We want to thank the gardaí who never gave up. They said they would bring Kieran home and they did,” he said. “Due to the nature of this case, any time we asked what was going on, the gardaí could not tell us. We were told when the case would come up in court, everything would come out. “We were hearing what really went on for the first time and were shocked, angry and in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened.” Mr Quilligan said that it was beyond difficult to listen to the “horror stories” that emerged over the course of the trial. He said that the defendants didn’t show “one bit of remorse” for murdering his son. He added that Kieran was a “loving son, brother and uncle” before thanking the gardaí and the prosecution team for treating Kieran “like a human being.” Catherine O’Flynn, the mother of Kieran Quilligan, said he was “adored” by his family. “Kieran had the biggest heart you ever seen. His birthday, 13 July 2023, was the last time I saw Kieran. If I had known what was going to happen I would never have left him leave the house,” she said. “I will never forgive them (Niall Long and Luke Taylor) for what they have put our family through.” Colette O’Driscoll, the partner of Kieran Quilligan, said that he left their home on 1 September 2023 and she never saw him again. Advertisement “Niall Long and Luke Taylor stole my future with the man I loved, adored and cherished.” She said that herself and Kieran were set to move in to their forever home when he was violently taken from this world. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long awaited castle. Now unfortunately Kieran will never get the keys to his castle.” Whilst sentencing Luke Taylor and Niall Long to mandatory life imprisonment, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford praised gardaí for the “exemplary” manner in which they carried out their comprehensive investigation. She said that the perpetrators might well have never been found other than for the enormous work of investigating gardaí. She also paid tribute to members of the Quilligan family for the manner in which they had conducted themselves in “difficult circumstances.” Ms Justice Lankford added that Kieran Quilligan was taken from this world in the “most egregious circumstances.” At the start of the sentencing hearing today, the coordinator of the Garda investigation, Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan of the Bridewell Garda Station in Cork, said that the two men subjected Kieran Quilligan to a “significant and sustained assault” on 1 September 2023. They then bundled him in to the boot of a car and brought him to a farmyard in Little Island. His body was then moved to the scrubland in Rostellan. She detailed the extensive harvesting of CCTV in the case which led gardaí to find the body of Kieran Quilligan and determine the identity of his killers. During the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, told the jury that the “instigating factor” for the murder was Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. Meanwhile, in the course of the trial the jurors heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem examination on the late Kieran Quilligan. Dr Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Kieran Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, leg and hand bones, jaw bones and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Father-of-two Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork, whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork. Kieran Quilligan was living with his partner in Simon Community housing in Cork city at the time of his death.

German crypto and digital asset manager Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA) and Nordic cryptocurrency exchange Safello have announced the launch of the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP. The launch comes as the crypto industry welcomes a growing number of digital asset-related products across the market, including the Bitcoin ETP by BlackRock. Meanwhile, Bittensor continues to attract attention as a top decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) project. Developments around AI, including from Big Tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta, have often pushed TAO and other AI tokens into the limelight. Frankfurt-based DDA, a pioneer in crypto exchange-traded products since 2017, announced the new product on October 29, 2025. The ETP is a collaboration with Safello and brings a physically backed Bittensor ETP to the expanding market. The product tracks the Kaiko Safello Staked Bittensor Index (KSSTAO) and is domiciled in Liechtenstein. Trading under ticker STAO (ISIN: DE000A4APQY4) on SIX is slated to commence to enhance seamless buying and selling during standard market hours. Moreover, the ETP is fully secured in cold storage by regulated custodian BitGo Europe GmbH and holds 100% physical TAO reserves. Investors are to benefit from total returns encompassing TAO’s price appreciation plus staking yields, automatically reinvested into the net asset value (NAV). With a competitive total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%, it provides an accumulating income structure, ideal for portfolio diversification amid rising interest in AI-driven blockchain assets. Maximilian Lautenschläger, CEO and founder of DDA, emphasized the strategic fit: “We are excited to announce the launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP through our collaboration with Safello. By leveraging DDA’s white-label ETP platform, we enable our partner to bring their innovative crypto investment strategies to market, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.” Bittensor (TAO) is currently trading at $425 and powers a groundbreaking peer-to-peer network, incentivizing collaborative machine learning. Participants contribute data, models, and compute power for tasks like image recognition, fraud detection, and protein structure prediction, earning TAO rewards in a proof-of-stake ecosystem. With a market cap exceeding $4.3 billion, Bittensor exemplifies the fusion of blockchain and AI, positioning it as a high-growth asset in the evolving digital economy. Safello CEO Emelie Moritz commented, “The launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP underlines Safello’s conviction in decentralised AI. Bittensor is a prime example of how decentralized technology and AI are converging to reshape the future of value creation. Together with DDA, we’re making it possible for investors to easily access this innovation through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle.” Bittensor price reached highs of $457 on Oct. 29, but its all-time high is $767, which it hit back in April 2024.

Nvidia has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the Silicon Valley chipmaker was first to break through the $4 trillion barrier. Hitting the new benchmark puts more emphasis on the upheaval being unleashed by an artificial intelligence craze that’s widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Apple rode the iPhone’s success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion. But there are concerns of a possible AI bubble, with officials at the Bank of England earlier this month flagging the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst. The head of the International Monetary Fund has raised a similar alarm. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia’s chips is the main reason that the company’s stock price has increased so rapidly since early 2023. On Wednesday the shares touched $207.86 in early morning trading with 24.3 billion shares outstanding, putting its market cap at $5.05 trillion. In comparison, Nvidia’s value is greater than the GDP of India, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nvidia carved out an early lead in tailoring its chipsets known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, from use in powering video games to helping to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Demand skyrocketed as more people began using AI chatbots. Tech companies scrambled for more chips to build and run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed concerns of a bubble bursting, saying that the generative AI chatbots that were merely “interesting” when they first took hold a few years ago are now becoming so useful that they will be profitable. Huang was heading to South Korea this week as leaders from major Pacific Rim economies, including the United States, China and Japan, are gathering for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that has long championed free trade but is now confronting sweeping U.S. tariffs on technology and other products. The multilateral gathering in Gyeongju is expected to be overshadowed by a sideline event — a face-to-face meeting on Thursday between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — as their intensifying trade war leaves the South Korean hosts in a difficult balancing act. On Tuesday, Huang disclosed $500 billion in chip orders. The company also announced a partnership with Uber on robotaxis and a $1 billion investment in Nokia, with the two planning to work together on 6G technology. In addition, Nvidia is teaming with the Department of Energy to build seven new AI supercomputers. Last month Nvidia announced that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to ramp up the computing power for the owner of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. In August, Huang said that Nvidia was discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. Trump said on Air Force One that he will speak with Xi about Nvidia’s chips on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC event that Huang is also attending. In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. That same month, Trump announced that the U.S. government had taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion.

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

Title: Two men jailed for life for murder of Kieran Quilligan

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor Two men have been jailed for life for the murder of another man whose skeletal remains were found in a gravel bag in a ravine in east Cork, five months after he went missing. A jury at the Central Criminal Court in Cork had been told Kieran Quilligan was lured to a laneway near Cork city centre before he was ambushed and beaten to death. Mr Quilligan was 47 years of age and was originally from Togher in Cork city. He went missing from St Finbarr's Place in Cork on the evening of 1 September 2023. Prosecuting Senior Counsel Donal O'Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court jury he had been lured to the laneway before he was ambushed. The State's case was that 28-year-old Luke Taylor, originally from Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was the one who lured Mr Quilligan to the laneway. Mr Quilligan was alleged to have stolen drugs and cash from a second man earlier in the day, 33-year-old Niall Long, originally from St Michael's Close in Mahon in Cork. Niall Long, it was alleged, ambushed him before he was beaten to death in retaliation for the earlier robbery. Both men were convicted of Mr Quilligan's murder by a jury last week. Their trial was told that gardaí undertook extensive searches for Mr Quilligan in east Cork, after CCTV tracked them travelling there immediately after he disappeared. His skeletal remains were found five months later by a cadaver dog, as part of a garda search. A post-mortem examination was unable to identify a cause of death for Mr Quilligan. But pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established he had been attacked with a weapon like a hammer and suffered fractures to his skull, neck and jaw, his hand, his leg, his chest and his ribs.

"The anger and frustration was unbearable for our family," he said. "We want to thank the gardai who never gave up. They told us they would bring Kieran home and they did. "Kieran was a loving son, brother and uncle. He is sadly missed by all of us and our lives will never be the same without him." Mr Quilligan's mother, Catherine O'Flynn, said he was missed, loved and adored. "If my love could have saved you, you would still be here with us," she said. "Our hearts were broken in a million pieces - our worst nightmare come true." In her victim impact statement, Mr Quilligan's long-term partner, Colette O'Driscoll, described how they had been given the good news that they were to be housed together a short time before he disappeared. "I have a heavy heart. I miss my best friend every day. I feel lonely without him," she said. Sentencing both men to life in prison, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford said Mr Quilligan's life had been taken in most egregious circumstances. She described the garda investigation as exemplary, and said Niall Long and Luke Taylor might never have been identified were it not for the huge volume of work on the case carried out by detectives. Both men indicated to the court through their counsel that they intend to appeal. Southern Editor © RTÉ 2025.

Title: The Evolution of Capitalism: Why Markets Defy Feudal Aristocracy

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Via Shutterstock. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. In 2005, Citigroup analysts coined the term Plutonomy as an ideological provocation disguised as analysis. They argued that global growth rested disproportionately on the spending of the wealthy, especially the “top 1%.” According to this claim, the world economy follows the whims of the global elites’ demand, while the majority slips into irrelevance. The Plutonomy thesis reveals either ignorance of capitalism or ideological hostility toward it. Left-collectivist critics embrace it because it dresses capitalism as feudalism in modern clothes. But in essence, capitalism and feudalism are opposites. Feudalism chains wealth and power to the bloodline, preserving a static order. Capitalism breaks that order. It multiplies, redistributes and even annihilates wealth through innovation, entrepreneurship and competition. Plutonomy advocates point to inequality data to support their case. Yes, wealth concentration exists, but the inference those advocates draw from it is false. Capitalism’s logic is not one of privilege but freedom. Studies from Williams Group wealth consultancy show that two-thirds of wealthy families lose their fortune by the second generation, and 90% by the third. Concentration of wealth is not permanent but a phase in a cycle. The system does not malfunction when wealth clusters — it functions. Success receives reward, but failure swiftly destroys fortunes. The capitalist system rests on voluntary exchange, individual initiative and open competition. The moral principle is not “the few rule the many” but “each individual acts by right.” Critics mistake correlation for causation. Rising wealth at the top does not mean exclusion of the bottom. In fact, global data since 1980 demonstrates that while the top 1% grew richer, more than a billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty. China, India and much of Southeast Asia did not escape starvation because elites consumed more; they escaped because capitalism’s logic of production and trade reached their masses. The logic of capitalism undermines Plutonomy at its root. Elites may shape markets, but capitalism’s engine lies in mass participation. The wealthy do not dictate growth; they compete within a framework shaped by consumer sovereignty and entrepreneurial risk. No aristocracy ever built an industrial revolution; no plutocracy ever lifted billions from poverty. Only capitalism, driven by free exchange and broad demand, accomplished that. Capitalism treats wealth as a process, not a possession. Entrepreneurs must continually recreate wealth through production, innovation and risk-taking. Inherited fortunes erode when heirs fail to compete. Thomas Piketty claimed that capital tends to accumulate, but capitalist markets demonstrate the opposite: Unused capital dissipates. This competitive order forces every firm and every individual to justify their position anew. Aristocracy freezes history in bloodlines while capitalism accelerates history through challenge, destruction and renewal. Joseph Schumpeter identified this dynamic as creative destruction. He argued that capitalism thrives by overturning the old and replacing it with the new. Innosight data confirms this: In the 1950s, Fortune 500 companies survived on average for 60 years. Today, they survive for less than 20 years. Kodak dominated photography with 90% of the film market, yet it collapsed in 2012 because it ignored digital innovation. Canon, Sony and other firms seized Kodak’s market by betting on digital technologies. Nokia controlled 40% of the cellphone market in 1999, but its share fell below 5% by 2013 because it missed the smartphone revolution. Apple and Samsung seized Nokia’s throne. In 1980, oil and auto companies such as Exxon, GM and Ford dominated the global rankings. By 2022, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla occupied those top positions. The World Economic Forum estimates that industries younger than 40 years generate over half of global GDP. Shifts in dominance reveal capitalism’s law: Innovators survive, complacent firms vanish. Entrepreneurial stories embody the same laws. American businessman Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in a garage in 1994 and expanded it into a trillion-dollar firm by leveraging capitalism’s infrastructure of financial markets and contract law. South African businessman Elon Musk reinvested profits from PayPal into Tesla and SpaceX, enterprises that toppled century-old automakers and state-run aerospace monopolies. American businessman Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in a dormitory and redefined global communication. These entrepreneurs did not inherit aristocratic dynasties. They acted. Forbes reports that more than 70% of billionaires worldwide are self-made, and in China, over 80% built their fortunes as first-generation entrepreneurs. Capitalism rewards action, not birth. This dynamic reality delivers capitalism’s strongest refutation of aristocracy and Plutonomy. Aristocracy assumes permanence; capitalism enforces transience. Aristocracy passes property by bloodline; capitalism demands innovation by merit. Plutonomy imagines static classes; capitalism generates continual upheaval. In 19th-century American business life, the rise of the “inventor-businessman” type most clearly revealed capitalism’s difference from aristocracy. Andrew Carnegie, a poor immigrant from Scotland, rose to become one of the giants of the steel industry. John D. Rockefeller, starting from humble origins, founded Standard Oil and became the world’s first dollar billionaire. Rockefeller was born in 1839 in New York to a poor family. His father, William Avery Rockefeller, worked as a charlatan traveling salesman, always chasing ventures and failing to provide a steady income. His mother lived frugally and devotedly. Rockefeller grew up amidst poverty and uncertainty but absorbed discipline and thrift early on. At 16, he began working in an accounting firm. In his first years of work, he carefully tracked every dollar, saving some and donating some to charity. By his early twenties, he entered the oil business in Cleveland with his partners. At the time, oil was new and difficult to refine, yet Rockefeller turned these difficulties into advantages. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1863 and quickly built it into the largest US oil company in refining, distribution and sales. He also tried to monopolize transportation by striking deals with railroad companies to gain cost advantages. This advantage lasted only until the state enacted antitrust laws. In 1911, the US Supreme Court declared Standard Oil a monopoly and ordered its breakup. Far from shrinking Rockefeller’s fortune, this ruling multiplied it, as the separated companies — Exxon, Chevron and Mobil — grew independently. The episode revealed a truth of the capitalist market: Even a monopoly, once broken, can generate more growth in a dynamic marketplace. Rockefeller also pioneered what we now call philanthropic capitalism. He donated hundreds of millions to institutions such as Harvard and the University of Chicago. The foundations he created in medicine and education still shape society today. He did not owe his wealth to the state, as state regulations tried to restrict him. He did not inherit aristocratic privilege, nor did he cling to feudal instincts of passing wealth intact to heirs. Instead, he taught his children thrift, philanthropy and entrepreneurship. Through his story, capitalism reveals its revolutionary and egalitarian nature: The son of a poor preacher left a permanent mark on world history through ability and hard work in the marketplace. The Rothschild family illustrates how intellect, numerical skill and entrepreneurship built a global banking network despite European antisemitism. Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the Frankfurt ghetto, where Jews lived under restriction with scarce educational opportunities. Mayer displayed an extraordinary passion for books and numbers. As a youth, he apprenticed with a banker in Frankfurt, learning financial calculations. He then traded antiques and rare coins, building his first capital. This step gave him access to Frankfurt’s nobility. In the 1760s, Mayer achieved his breakthrough when he became financial advisor to Wilhelm IX, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (a state within the Holy Roman Empire). He managed the prince’s wealth but showed greater genius by sending four of his five sons — Nathan Mayer, Saloman Mayer, Karl Mayer and James Mayer — to Europe’s capitals to establish a family banking network. Nathan went to London, Salomon to Vienna, Karl to Naples and James to Paris. The Rothschilds became the most influential financial family of 19th-century Europe. Their success came from superior knowledge, communication and risk management. Before the telegraph, they created networks that gave them faster access to market information. During the Napoleonic Wars, they controlled key information flows, lent money to Britain and helped finance the British army against France. The Rothschilds did not descend from a dynasty. They exemplified how a marginalized Jewish family could, despite prohibitions, become leaders in finance by investing in knowledge and commerce. The capitalist market valued their achievement, not their lineage. And although their descendants remain financially active, modern giants like BlackRock and Vanguard far surpass the influence the Rothschilds held a century ago. Their eclipse proves again that capitalism does not freeze into aristocracy but renews itself endlessly. Capitalism’s competitive nature creates a powerful resistance mechanism against the absolutization of economic power. Competition functions not as an external safeguard but as the system’s internal law, its self-regulating force. Those who claim that capitalists inevitably form cartels to seize markets misunderstand the essence of capitalism. Oligopolies may rise, and firms may dominate for a time, but such power cannot last. Knowledge flows, entrepreneurship pushes forward and innovation breaks every chain. The marketplace acts as a battlefield in which permanence is an illusion. What matters is the ability to adapt, not the possession of a temporary advantage. In the late 1980s, Microsoft commanded almost absolute dominance in global software with its Windows operating system and Office suite, which ran on over 80% of personal computers. Yet, this supremacy did not endure. Google rose by capturing the internet, Apple transformed communication through the iPhone and Linux opened doors for free software alternatives. Today, Microsoft remains powerful, yet it no longer controls the future of computing. The automobile industry reveals the same dynamic. For decades, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler ruled the US market. But Japanese firms —Toyota, Honda, Nissan — challenged them with efficient production and durable models. By the 1980s, Japanese automakers controlled nearly 30% of the US market, forcing Detroit into reform or collapse. In this century, Tesla has shattered the industry again, proving that even the giants of capitalism cannot insulate themselves from new rivals armed with better ideas. This fragility does not weaken capitalism; it strengthens it. Dynamism, not stagnation, defines its law. The rise of the East Asian Tigers — South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong — illustrates capitalism’s transformative power. In 1960, South Korea’s GDP per capita barely reached $150; by 2020, it had risen to over $30,000. Taiwan, once an agrarian economy, became a global technology leader and now produces more than 54% of the world’s semiconductors through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Singapore, a city-state without natural resources, climbed to rank among the wealthiest nations, with a GDP per capita surpassing $70,000. These countries escaped poverty not by state planning but by unleashing markets, encouraging exports, fostering education and creating an open environment for enterprise. Centrally planned economies show the opposite trajectory. The Soviet Union, despite immense resources, collapsed under inefficiency. Former supreme leader Mao Zedong’s China starved tens of millions. Only when Mao’s successor Deng Xiaoping’s reforms embraced markets in 1978 did China’s GDP begin to grow at an average of nearly 10% per year for three decades, lifting 800 million people out of extreme poverty. The real enemy of competition is not capitalism but the state. History shows that whenever governments step in to control markets, competition collapses. In the 17th century, the British Crown granted the East India Company exclusive rights to trade in Asia. Instead of innovation, this monopoly produced corruption, inefficiency and exploitation, until its collapse in the 19th century. In the 20th century, state-backed corporations in Latin America — such as Pemex in Mexico or Petrobras in Brazil — became centers of inefficiency and political patronage, draining resources without innovation. The United States itself has suffered similar distortions: The government’s antitrust case against AT&T in the 1980s reveals how state-protected dominance stalled telecommunications innovation. Once AT&T was broken up, competition flourished, giving rise to mobile telephony, the internet and the digital revolution. In the second half of the 20th century, South Korea and Taiwan embraced export-led capitalism, transforming from impoverished to high-income economies. Between 1960 and 1990, South Korea’s GDP per capita grew nearly tenfold. By contrast, North Korea, under state control, stagnated in famine and isolation. The same divide appeared in Germany: West Germany’s market economy surged after 1948, while East Germany’s socialist experiment collapsed under inefficiency and repression. Latin America shows the same truth. Venezuela — with the world’s largest proven oil reserves — nationalized industries and imposed state control. By 2020, its GDP had contracted by over 70% from the previous decade, inflation exceeded one million percent and millions fled the country in response to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, Chile liberalized markets in the 1970s and 80s. From 1990 to 2015, its poverty rate fell from 40% to under 10%, and it became Latin America’s richest nation per capita. In China, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) consume over 30% of the country’s bank credit yet generate less than 10% of GDP growth. World Bank data shows SOEs earn returns on assets less than half those of private firms. They survive on subsidies, cheap credit and political protection. By contrast, private firms — Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and BYD — compete globally and drive breakthroughs in telecom, digital finance and electric vehicles. The difference lies in rules: SOEs live by privilege, private firms by competition. SOEs employ barely 10% of China’s workforce yet capture most corporate credit, starving small firms of capital. Productivity lags because connected giants hoard resources. Meanwhile, the private sector — responsible for 80% of urban jobs and 70% of innovation — faces crackdowns whenever it threatens state power. The West tells the story in another form. The 2008 financial crisis showed how intervention entrenches failure. US and European governments bailed out American International Group (AIG), Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and others, freezing competition and rewarding recklessness. The US Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent $700 billion rescuing failing banks, while the Eurozone added trillions in guarantees. Instead of disciplining error, states preserved it. These bailouts created a sense of moral hazard. Banks knew governments would shield them, so accountability vanished. A decade of ultra-low rates followed, keeping “zombie companies” alive. This was not a result of capitalism failing, but capitalism blocked. The corrective force of failure capitalism provides, was replaced by political privilege. Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand foresaw it: “The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is only a matter of time.” When governments protect the incompetent, they turn markets from arenas of merit into shelters of privilege. The market demands discipline. Remove that truth, and freedom vanishes. State-backed oligopolies, rent-seeking firms and politically privileged corporations represent the intrusion of non-capitalist elements into the system. Rand captured this with brutal clarity in her novel Atlas Shrugged: When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion — when you see that in order to produce, you need permission from men who produce nothing — when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors … you may know that your society is doomed. Her warning underscores the point: government favoritism replaces merit with power and enterprise with privilege. A genuine free market grants no actor permanent advantage. Every success must be tested, every fortune re-earned, every firm challenged. Collectivist regimes historically reveal the true nature of plutonomy. The Soviet Union gave Politburo elites privileges comparable to those of Western billionaires, while ordinary people could not access basic goods. In China, Mao’s Cultural Revolution impoverished millions, while Party cadres enjoyed privileged lives. During Deng’s reforms, the state integrated market elements but ensured that real capital accumulation still depended on Party ties. In contemporary China, the case of business magnate and investor Jack Ma illustrates this reality: after criticizing government policies, he lost public visibility, and the state restructured Alibaba (a multinational technology company), demonstrating how easily political authority can dismantle market success. The case of Venezuela illustrates the modern socialist version of plutonomy. Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez built his 21st-century socialism not by distributing oil revenues to the people but by concentrating them within the state apparatus and a loyal elite. Managers of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) enriched themselves rapidly in foreign currency, while the general population lacked access to basic food and medicine. These cases prove that plutonomy emerges not in capitalism but in collectivism. Capitalism’s stability and sustainability depend on a broad consumer base that responds to production. Economic growth and prosperity come not from the excessive wealth of the minority but from the consumption capacity of the majority. The capitalist market functions as a democratic decision-making arena. Consumers, through their daily purchasing choices, effectively cast votes in the marketplace. These votes reflect not only economic value but also preference. The market thus becomes a ballot box where products and services, not rulers, compete. Consumer behavior directly shapes economic existence. The consumer acts as capitalism’s “silent voter” — silent because the vote is cast by buying, not speaking. Yet this silence masks immense power: the collective choices of consumers decide whether a product stays on shelves, spreads or vanishes. Unlike centrally planned systems, capitalism rests on pluralism and bottom-up consent. Liberal democratic philosophy aligns with this capitalist structure. Just as political leaders rise through popular votes, entrepreneurs and producers survive only through consumer choice. No matter their capital, ventures without customers collapse. This reality highlights capitalism’s populist and majoritarian nature, not an aristocratic one. Capitalism is no elitist club but a competitive arena built on mass consent. For a product to remain in the market, it must resonate with the public. This constant need for validation keeps capitalism open to pressures from below. Broad participation is the indispensable condition of capitalist democracy. If middle- and lower-income groups cannot participate, the voting mechanism breaks down. Capitalism requires individuals not just to exist as consumers but to function effectively as consumers. The democratic nature of the market creates fairness and dynamism. Consumer choice directs supply, drives innovation, raises efficiency and prevents waste. Each purchase acts as a “yes” vote; each rejection, a “no” vote. This continuous micro-level voting process builds a coordination mechanism more precise and dynamic than any central planner could achieve. The market generates a natural order through supply and demand. Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek described this as spontaneous order, where knowledge spreads through millions of free decisions, not through central authority. No ministry or planning agency can collect and process such knowledge. French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville highlights a fundamental tension in Democracy in America: In democratic societies, when freedom is sacrificed to equality, people become passive and consent to their own chains. The plutonomy discourse offers exactly such chains: it promises not freedom but passivity under the guise of equality. Capitalism rests on the moral principle of consent. Neither producer nor consumer, neither employer nor employee, enters the system by force. This order, built on mutual benefit, secures not only economic efficiency but also individual autonomy. Capitalist economics allow the individual to secure their place through labor, capital or ideas. In contrast, plutonomy undermines freedom by persuading individuals to believe in systemic determinism rather than their own potential. This mentality denies individual worth and responsibility, portraying success not as the product of productivity but as a matter of birth privilege. As a result, young individuals turn away from entrepreneurship, and potential inventors give way to “pseudo-opponents” who hate the system yet make no contribution.

Title: Did You Miss Broadcom Stock’s $51 Billion Payout?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/did-you-miss-broadcom-stocks-51-billion-payout/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:07:05Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered a significant $51 billion back to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems from Broadcom's position as a dominant supplier of mission-critical semiconductor chips and infrastructure software, where the company operates in markets with exceptionally high barriers to entry and generates industry-leading margins that convert revenue into pure cash flow. Broadcom’s cash machine operates on two highly profitable pillars: its semiconductor solutions business that generates $34 billion (LTM) with products so essential to data center, networking, and mobile infrastructure, and its infrastructure software division producing $26 billion through mission-critical enterprise software, including VMware's virtualization platform that customers rely on for their core operations. The company’s business model is particularly cash-generative because it focuses on high-margin, recurring revenue streams, allowing Broadcom to convert approximately $24+ billion annually into free cash flow from its $51.6 billion revenue base. Let's examine some statistics and see how this cash return capability compares to the largest capital-return companies in the market. Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd highest for total returns to shareholders in history. Why should this matter to you? Because dividends and stock buybacks provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s fiscal health and capability to generate sustainable cash inflows. Additionally, there are numerous other stocks like this. Here’s a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. For comprehensive rankings, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The total amount of capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth expectations for reinvestment opportunities. Companies like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significantly faster growth, more predictably when compared to their counterparts, but have returned a much smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders. This represents the downside of high capital returns. Certainly, they are appealing, but you need to ask yourself: Am I compromising on growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping this in mind, let’s review some data for AVGO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for more insight) That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. That said, AVGO is not immune to significant downturns. It experienced a nearly 48% drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, around 35% during the 2021 inflation shock, and approximately 27% during the 2018 correction. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Go – for more details. Even with robust fundamentals, it is evident that the stock can undergo substantial declines when market conditions change. Quality companies still suffer when market sentiment shifts abruptly. However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider circumstances like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in forecasts. Check AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines historically. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Amazon Stock To Move After Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-traders-expect-amazon-stock-to-move-after-earnings-q3-2025-11838456
Time Published: 2025-10-28T19:28:36Z
Full Content:
Amazon (AMZN) is slated to report third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and some traders are betting the results can lift the stock, the laggard of the Magnificent Seven so far this year, to a fresh record. Amazon stock is expected to move about 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to recent options pricing data. A move of that magnitude, based on Monday's closing price, would put Amazon shares at about $243.50, an all-time high, or $215. Amazon's $2.4 trillion market capitalization makes its stock one of the most impactful in the U.S. equity market. A big share price move after Thursday's results would have a larger effect on the major indexes than nearly every other stock. Amazon stock has moved an average of 4.7% following its four most recent earnings reports. Shares slumped more than 8% after the company in July reported cloud revenue growth that disappointed Wall Street after strong showings from competitors Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG). The last time Amazon stock rose following an earnings report was this time last year, when the company topped sales and earnings estimates on strong cloud and advertising growth. Amazon is the worst-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven so far this year, with the company’s outsized tariff exposure weighing on shares. The stock is up just 5% since the start of the year. Amazon’s retail business is contending with increased tariff costs and increasingly squeezed consumers, while its cloud computing unit is making massive data center investments to meet demand for AI workloads. As such, cost savings will be top of mind for investors during Thursday’s earnings call with executives. Amazon on Tuesday announced it would cut 14,000 corporate roles, reportedly part of a larger downsizing that could see the company slash up to 30,000 office jobs, nearly 10% of its white collar workforce. And according to a recent New York Times report, some executives expect warehouse robotics to keep the company from hiring as many as 600,000 workers in the coming years. Cloud growth and capital expenditures will also be in focus. Amazon’s infrastructure investments totaled more than $31 billion in the second quarter, about 20% more than Wall Street was expecting. Chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky forecast the second quarter's spending would be "reasonably representative" of capex spending for the remainder of the year. Update—October 29, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and stock prices.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Amazon layoffs 2025 shook the tech world. The company is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs. That’s about 4% of its white-collar staff. The move is to boost its AI transformation. Most cuts hit tech and office roles, not warehouses. CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon must get leaner and faster. Investors liked the shift. Amazon stock (AMZN) traded near $226.97, edging higher. Wolfe Research kept its $270 target, citing stronger margins and AI growth.

Title: Buy Or Sell Adobe Stock?

Time Published: 2025-10-28T13:38:35Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers thick margins at a reduced price. Here are some statistics. While growth in revenue is beneficial, this should not be viewed merely from a growth perspective. Pricing power along with high margins contributes to consistent and predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and enables capital to be reinvested. The market typically rewards such stability. Beyond the financials, a couple of structural advantages drive Adobe’s outlook. The company is a leader in digital media and enterprise software, and has pivoted to a subscription model that drives recurring revenue. Its integrated workflow solutions create high switching costs, helping customer retention. The company is also witnessing growing adoption of its creative and enterprise tools enhanced by generative AI. For context, Adobe offers a range of software solutions globally, including its Creative Cloud subscription, catering to enterprise clients across Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. However, do these figures truly paint the complete picture? Explore Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe possesses an enduring advantage that remains resilient beneath the surface. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed – the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can tilt the odds in your favor. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data Here’s our selection process: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and filter out those exhibiting high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively focus on stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the past year. Below are the statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been applied since 12/31/2016. However, Consider the Risks That being said, Adobe has encountered substantial declines in difficult times. It fell about 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decline was around 60%. Even the less severe downturns, such as those in 2018 and during the Covid pandemic, resulted in a loss of approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite the favorable aspects, Adobe does not escape the impact when markets decline. Nonetheless, the risks are not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even during strong markets – consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook. Refer to ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from steep drops in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it’s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Invest $100K In These Funds, Beat Inflation For A Lifetime
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/28/invest-100k-in-these-funds-beat-inflation-for-a-lifetime/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T13:15:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I hate to see investors (particularly retirees) starving for dividends, especially with inflation stuck around 3% (and you and I both know that the real number is higher—just head down to your local grocery store!). A big myth around dividends is that you have to invest a lot upfront to get anything meaningful in return. It’s easy to see why people feel that way, with the average S&P 500 stock paying a meager 1.1% as I write this. This is where my favorite investments, closed-end funds (CEFs), come in. Using the three we’ll delve into below, you could get a little over $1,000 a month in income, thanks to their double-digit yields. What’s more, this three-fund portfolio mixes stocks and bonds to get us some nice diversification (and the downside protection that comes with it). Let’s start with bonds. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund (KIO) holds over 300 bonds and other loans issued by the likes of JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL), chemical maker Chemours Co. (CC), Virgin Media and consulting firm Kroll. KIO takes the interest it collects and flips it to investors in the form of that hefty 12.4% dividend. Moreover, nearly all of its bonds are below-investment grade. That’s more of an opportunity than a risk, because that’s where the highest yields, and best bargains, are. Moreover, KIO has been around for over a decade and—despite rising interest rates, a pandemic and other turmoil—has steadily increased its net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) in that time. All of that suggests KIO can keep delivering its high yield. Moreover, it has a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), so there’s gain potential if that discount shrinks, or flips to a premium, as it did just last year. In other words, you can pick up KIO, wait for its discount to shrink, then sell at a profit. And you get to collect that sweet dividend in the meantime. Now let’s add stocks through the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA), a CEF holding well-known firms like AI stars NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Even so, this fund is nicely diversified, and management has smartly bought and sold its holdings to drive a big jump in its portfolio, or NAV, since the April selloff. This return is more than enough to cover the fund’s dividend, which yields 11.3% annualized. That return should be rewarded with a premium valuation, yet USA not only trades at a discount, but its discount has widened, creating a rare buying opportunity. USA hasn’t been this cheap since the pandemic! When investors see that they can get NVIDIA, Microsoft and more at a near-10% markdown, expect them to drive this fund’s price up. Buy now and you can get the fund’s huge dividend while you wait. (Though we should note that the fund’s dividend does “float” a bit—which is a good thing: It gives management the opportunity to pick up bargains in a selloff, potentially boosting our long-term gains.) With stocks and bonds together, and an average 11.9% yield between our first two funds, we already have a great portfolio that can withstand years of market volatility. But we’re not done yet. Let’s wrap by adding energy stocks through the NXG Cushing Midstream Energy Fund (SRV). Its 12.8% yield is the biggest of our trio, but its pricing chart is different. With a 2.5% premium, SRV is priced right around where its portfolio’s true value lies. And note how the fund’s market pricing has been rangebound in the last couple years, hovering around par. That’s after SRV traded at an absurd post-pandemic discount, when energy demand wasn’t rising quickly, while at the same time, technology was making energy production easier, causing a surplus. Now, with AI, the story is different: Technology is driving energy demand higher, far beyond the degree to which it’s making energy production easier. Those power prices are likely to stick around, which is why SRV has been priced higher of late. This makes SRV a great fund for shorter-term action; collect the 12.8% dividend, sure, but be prepared to sell if the fund’s premium rises much beyond 5%. Then you can use your returns to buy USA, KIO or another oversold CEF. Then, when that fund gets overbought, sell it at a profit after collecting your dividends and use that to buy another high-yielding CEF. That’s the beauty of CEFs, and in particular CEFs’ discounts to NAV, which tell us exactly when a fund has reached a peak valuation. And then, of course, there are the dividends: As mentioned, the three-fund mini-portfolio we just discussed starts you off with over $1,000 per month in income for every $100K you invest. But over time, you can expect your portfolio to grow—and its income potential to keep rising as it does. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio This week on the podcast. Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.

Title: Michael Dell’s son aims to transform the home power business by selling electricity and backup battery power like a Costco membership
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/28/michael-dell-son-zach-base-power-electricity-backup-battery-power-costco-membership/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. Zach Dell watched his father Michael become one of the richest men in the world building a home computing and tech empire, and now he’s aiming to revolutionize the home electricity business with his Base Power. Austin, Texas-headquartered Base, which just completed a $1 billion fundraising round in October, takes the “Costco membership” route by offering a one-stop shop for the home: electricity and a backup-power solution courtesy of a battery storage system, not a standard gas generator. “We’re addressing a very acute problem that consumers face, which is that electricity has gotten more expensive and less reliable,” Zach Dell, 29, told Fortune. “It’s totally crazy if you think of all the things that have gotten better over the last decade, and our power has gotten noticeably worse. Batteries, paired with software and a unique business model, can make your power more reliable and less expensive.” U.S. power demand is rapidly rising thanks to the AI boom and, when coupled with aging grid infrastructure and rising occurrences of wildfires and natural disasters, backup power is becoming more desirable for many homeowners. Base’s business model offers standard retail electricity, a monthly membership fee of $19, and a leased battery system for a one-time cost of $695—as opposed to a whole-home, backup generator system that can cost upward of $15,000. Base customers may pay more per month because of the membership fee, which covers ongoing services and software battery power management, but they avoid paying the massive one-time cost of a whole-home generator system. “We’re just dramatically more affordable. Do you want the Lamborghini or the [Toyota] Corolla?” Dell said. “We make a product that is reliable, it’s safe, it’s affordable. It’s really a mass-market product. The other companies in the space are selling a premium product to very wealthy folks. Our product is more designed for the mass market.” His Dell Technologies founder and CEO father, Michael, is not involved in Base. Top investors include the venture capital firm Addition, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet’s CapitalG, and many more. Thus far, Base only operates in Texas, including the Austin, Houston, and Dallas regions. But Base, which was founded in 2023, is pivoting from startup mode to ramped-up growth mode, and the tentative plan is to begin expanding outside of Texas in 2026, Dell said. “We have this big, fast-growing business in Texas,” Dell said, “but the long-term ambition is to bring Base to every household in America.” Base Power has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity and is building its first battery factory in downtown Austin. A second factory is planned as well. The vertical integration model will further drive costs down over time, Dell said. “The capital will really be used to invest in this vertical integration strategy and get to scale so we can deliver the most affordable product on the market,” he said. “This is our first-generation [battery] product. As we come out with new versions of the product, prices will go down because our economics will get better.” While Michael Dell is not directly involved in Base, he does regularly offer business advise to his only son, who seemingly inherited the entrepreneurship gene. “He’s an extremely valuable mentor” Zach Dell said. “I’m inspired by him not because of how much money he’s made or the stock price, but because of the joy it brings him to build something and to solve hard problems and work on interesting puzzles. I’m very lucky that I get to spend my days solving really hard and complicated puzzles with smart people.” Zach Dell grew up in the Austin area before attending the University of Southern California. He dabbled in startups before joining Blackstone and then working at Thrive Capital. He started to study energy markets and saw the energy transition moving toward solar power coupled with battery storage. Dell said Base is focusing on battery storage in part because the technology is advancing, it’s scalable, and it’s easy to install for homeowners. And the stored power in the battery keeps your home powered when outages occur. A second battery is offered at a deeply discounted rate for larger homes. Prices are kept relatively lower because, when your power is working normally, the battery can store power and then provide electricity back to the grid when demand is at its highest. In the event of a prolonged power outage, Base customers can even buy a smaller, roughly $500 generator to power just the battery system if it runs out of juice on its own. “With that integration, it’s effectively an infinite backup product,” Dell said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: The Reason Caterpillar's Stock Is 'Priced for Perfection'—And Beating Nvidia in 2025

A company known for its distinctive yellow construction equipment and its iconic logo has become an AI darling. Yes, we mean Caterpillar (CAT)—which through Monday's close has the best-performing stock in the Dow, ahead of companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), thanks to an AI-driven metamorphosis. Caterpillar has lately seen stalling earnings growth in 2025, with its past two quarterly reports missing expectations. Still, its shares are up more than 45% year-to-date, more than the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLI) 18% gain, the S&P's 17%, and Nvidia's 38%. And when Caterpillar reports third-quarter earnings pre-market tomorrow morning, investors are likely to focus on a key driver of its future growth: data centers' surging demand for electricity. That trend is shifting the spotlight to Caterpillar's energy and transportation segment from its construction and resources segments, which have been challenged. The latter—bulldozers, excavators, and mining trucks—will "take a backseat" as the former—backup and primary power generation sets, solar turbines, and gas pipelines—drives earnings in the coming years, according to BofA Global Research analysts, who have a "buy" rating on the stock. The E&T segment accounts for roughly 40% of Caterpillar's sales, according to BofA. Businesses within the segment, including its power generation business, "continue to outgrow the overall business," Bank of America wrote in June. Last year, E&T chipped in about $29 billion of the company's roughly $65 billion in total sales, more than either of the construction and resources units. Caterpillar's stock has been a beneficiary of investor penchant for AI-themed investments. Its next earnings report, due Wednesday morning, will be the latest opportunity for investors to determine whether the company's data center power-play narrative can endure. Can the stock keep rising? Morgan Stanley analyst Angel Castillo recent said Caterpillar shares, sitting near all-time highs, were "priced for perfection." Wall Street analysts, on average, have a price target of about $497, 6% below Monday's close of $527. More evidence of an oversupplied construction market and the firm's cautious views on non-residential construction activity, Castillo said, will put pressure on its construction segment. Without strength in other segments to offset that weakness, he said, there's the risk of negative earnings revisions. Still, growth in E&T could be a potent mood booster. "Any amount of sequential growth is enough to keep sentiment positive," he wrote in a report last week. The firm has a bearish rating on the stock.

October 27, 2025 15:00 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. News Highlights SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced two next-generation systems at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) designed to expand America’s leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), the Lux AI supercomputer and the Discovery supercomputer. Discovery and Lux will be DOE flagship supercomputers designed to drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security. Both systems directly support the U.S. AI Action Plan by accelerating AI-enabled science, strengthening national competitiveness, and advancing secure, sovereign AI infrastructure for the nation. Together with the U.S. government, ORNL and industry partners, AMD will deliver advanced computing platforms that help national researchers, agencies, and innovators tackle pressing challenges in energy, medicine, health, and national security. When fully deployed, the Lux and Discovery systems will represent a combined $1billion investment of private and public funding which will enable the DOE to build a secure, federated and standards-based infrastructure for sovereign U.S. AI and science. “We are proud and honored to partner with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to accelerate America’s foundation for science and innovation,” said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO, AMD. “Discovery and Lux will leverage AMD’s high-performance and AI computing technologies to advance the most critical U.S. research priorities in science, energy, and medicine – demonstrating the power of public-private partnership at their best.” The Lux AI supercomputer – co-developed by ORNL, AMD, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and HPE and powered by AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Pensando™ advanced networking technologies – will be deployed in early 2026, making it the first US AI Factory supercomputer setting the stage for novel public and private partnerships. The Lux system will address the immediate needs to expand the DOE’s AI leadership and accelerate progress and innovation in the areas of AI, energy research, materials, medicine and advanced manufacturing. The Discovery supercomputer deepens the collaboration between the DOE, ORNL, HPE and AMD. At the heart of Discovery are next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs, codenamed “Venice,” and AMD Instinct™ MI430X GPUs— a new MI400 Series accelerator engineered specifically for sovereign AI and scientific computing. MI430X extends the leadership AMD architecture for AI and HPC, enabling the U.S. to train, simulate, and deploy AI models on domestically built systems that protect national data and scientific competitiveness. “Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that will bring together the brightest minds and industries American technology and science has to offer,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “That’s why the Trump administration is announcing the first example of a new commonsense approach to computing partnerships with Lux. We are also announcing, as part of a competitive procurement process, Discovery. Working with AMD and HPE, we’re bringing new capacity online faster than ever before, turning shared innovation into national strength, and proving that America leads when private-public partners build together.” “The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before,” said ORNL Director Stephen Streiffer. “ORNL’s leadership in supercomputing has dramatically shortened researchers’ time from problem to solution across a host of fields and industries. With Discovery, the integration of high-performance computing and AI promises breakthroughs at the accelerated speed and scale necessary for continued U.S. leadership in an increasingly competitive global environment.” “We are proud that the partnership between HPE and AMD is at the forefront of advancing the next generation of supercomputing in the AI era for Oak Ridge National Laboratory,” said Antonio Neri, president and CEO at HPE. “HPE’s newest supercomputing solutions harness converged AI and HPC architectures, enabling the lab to achieve unprecedented productivity and scale. This collaboration also reinforces American leadership in applying AI to science, energy and national security.” “Oracle is honored to work alongside the Department of Energy to help drive breakthroughs in science, energy, and national security,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle will deliver sovereign, high-performance AI infrastructure that will support the co-development of the Lux AI cluster.” Lux AI Supercomputer: Advancing U.S. AI Leadership Lux at ORNL is the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security—purpose-built to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI foundation models that will accelerate discovery and engineering innovation. Lux is designed to accelerate AI-driven science through its advanced architecture, optimized for data-intensive and model-centric workloads. As a critical resource for the DOE and the National Laboratory system, Lux will give the United States an early and decisive advantage in deploying frontier AI capabilities that transform the pace and scale of scientific innovation. By dramatically expanding the nation’s capacity for scientific AI, Lux strengthens U.S. leadership, accelerates AI-for-Science, and helps ensure that the breakthroughs of the AI era are discovered, developed, and deployed in America. Lux will unleash a new generation of scientific capabilities across the DOE’s mission to, reveal nature’s hidden structure, discover breakthrough materials, accelerate energy innovation, transform biology and biosecurity, and advance national security and resilience. Discovery: America’s Next Leap in Scientific Computing Purpose‑built for AI and science, Discovery features a “Bandwidth Everywhere” design that allows science and AI applications to run efficiently and deliver productive results. Importantly, Frontier laid the foundation for this work, and together with HPE Cray Supercomputing GX5000 – its next-generation supercomputing platform – Discovery builds on that success with a consistent programming environment to ensure an easy transition for users. Discovery will be the DOE’s next flagship supercomputer at ORNL, arriving in 2028, and will extend U.S. leadership in HPC and AI. Advancing America’s innovation agenda, Discovery reflects a strong, public‑private commitment to keep the United States at the forefront of AI and scientific innovation. Building on the breakthroughs of Frontier—the world’s first exascale system—Discovery is designed to deliver dramatically higher performance, energy efficiency, and AI capabilities. Discovery will drive breakthroughs in energy, biology, advanced materials, national security, and manufacturing innovation. It will help design next-generation reactors, batteries, catalysts, semiconductors, and critical materials. Key Points of Discovery: ORNL is expected to take delivery of Discovery in 2028, with user operations expected in 2029. Once online, Discovery will serve as a cornerstone of the American AI Stack, advancing the science, security, and innovation goals that define the nation’s next decade.

Title: Geraldine Weiss Had An Interesting Formula

ByJohn Dorfman, Contributor. When a stock sports a dividend yield above its own historical average, one of two things has happened. The company may have raised its dividend – usually a good sign. Or, the dividend yield may have gone up because the stock’s price went down. That suggests there’s been bad news, but it hints at a possible bargain. Some investment professionals seek out stocks whose dividend yield is above their own normal level. Probably the best-known practitioner of this approach was the late Geraldine Weiss, who wrote a book called Dividends Don’t Lie. I wrote a column about the Geraldine Weiss approach in September 2024. The five stocks I selected returned 23.4% in the ensuing year, beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 at 17.6%. Those figures are total returns, both price gain (or loss) and dividends. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future. I’d like to give Weiss’s approach another try. Here are four stocks that look good to me now, based on her method. The infamous Enron Corp., which went down in the flames of accounting fraud in 2001, has several surviving children. One is EOG Resources Inc. (EOG); the initials once stood for Enron Oil & Gas. Based in Houston, EOG produces the equivalent of more than one million barrels of oil a year. Its mix is about 31% natural gas and 69% oil and natural-gas liquids. Over the past ten years, EOG’s typical dividend yield has been about 1.8%. Today the yield is 3.7%. Geraldine Weiss fans, take note. EOG has been increasing its dividend rapidly in recent years. In 2019 the dividend was $1.01 a share. In the past four quarters the payout has been $3.77. Molson Coors Beverage Co., a brewer based in Golden, Colorado, has averaged a 2.5% dividend yield over the past decade. Today the stock yields 4%. The shares have done miserably over the past ten years, losing close to half of their value. Many investors think that beer is a buggy-whip industry. U.S. beer sales have been declining, and imports are grabbing an increasing share of a shrinking pie. Sensibly, Molson is trying to diversify away from beer, offering hard cider, hard seltzer, canned cocktails and energy drinks. These days, many investors think of Novo Nordisk AS (NVO), which is based in Denmark, primarily as a weight-loss drug maker. I, however, think of it primarily as a leader in diabetes medications. The stock peaked at about $147 last year, and has descended all the way to $53 as Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) has moved to the front in weight-loss drugs. After its fall, Novo Nordisk shares yield 3.3%, well above the ten-year median of 1.9%. The company’s net profit margin is above 35% and its return on stockholders’ equity is about 81%. Even if those figures decline some, I think the stock is a bargain, selling for about 14 times earnings. Based in New York City, Interparfums Inc. makes and sells perfume and cologne under a wide variety of licensed brands, such as Coach, Karl Lagerfeld, Montblanc and Van Cleef & Arpels. Its dividend yield has normally been about 1.7%. Now it’s 3.2%. The stock has declined, partly because sales and earnings growth have slowed, and perhaps partly because investors fear a recession. It peaked at about $158 five years ago, and now sells for around $96. I think the decline is overdone. Growth was still pretty good in the past year, with sales up 7% and earnings up 17%. My maiden column discussing Geraldine Weiss’s approach was encouraging, as three of my five picks beat the S&P 500’s return, and all five were profitable. The best performer was UGI Corp. (UGI), which distributes natural gas, propane and electricity, mostly in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It returned 43% (including dividends). Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) attracted a takeover offer from a private equity firm, Sycamore Partners. It returned more than 37%. Also beating the index, but by a narrower margin, was Magna International Inc. (MGA), a Canadian auto parts maker. Considering the trade frictions (and other frictions) between the U.S. and Canada, I’m pleasantly surprised. US Bancorp. (USB) and Greif Inc. (GEF.B) returns 10% and 4% respectively, trailing the index. Disclosure: I own Novo Nordisk personally and for most of my clients. Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager, owns EOG personally and for clients.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News GroupNews Commentary – Gold prices held above $4,100 per ounce through late October 2025, extending a year that has delivered over 25% gains since January and positioned the precious metal for its strongest annual performance since 1979[1]. This sustained rally at elevated levels drove mining profit margins to unprecedented territory[2], with producers seeing margins effectively double as operational costs remain relatively stable while gold continues to commands prices above $4,000 per ounce. Against this backdrop of record bullion values and enhanced economics, exploration and development companies across multiple jurisdictions are accelerating programs, among them Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF), First Mining Gold Corp. (TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF), Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF), U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO), and Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA). Bank of America raised its 2026 gold forecast to $5,000 per ounce, citing unorthodox fiscal policies and rising debt levels as persistent tailwinds for the metal[3]. Meanwhile, JPMorgan projects prices averaging $3,675 per ounce by Q4 2025 before climbing toward $4,000 by mid-2026[4], with sustained central bank purchasing and investor demand averaging 710 tonnes quarterly underpinning the forecast, creating compelling timing advantages for companies advancing high-grade projects toward production. Lake Victoria Gold (TSXV: LVG) (OTCQB: LVGLF) has reported continued exploration success at its Tembo-area licences, where Barrick Gold's Bulyanhulu joint venture completed 12 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,380 metres during Q2 2025. The results confirm the geological continuity between Barrick's flagship Tanzanian mine and LVG's 100%-owned adjacent ground. "Barrick's methodical exploration is confirming the geological architecture we've interpreted on our licence area," said Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO of LVG. "As they advance, LVG benefits from both the direct geological insights and the potential for substantial contingent payments—creating a rare opportunity of value addition through a combination of near-term potential production development at Imwelo and the Tembo project, and discovery leverage through the Buly exploration." The Q2 drilling confirmed favorable geology, intersecting mafic metavolcanics (greenstone) and quartz porphyry dykes, which display weak to moderate deformation and have associated silica-sericite alteration, and localized disseminated pyrite and quartz veining—promising indicators for gold mineralization in this highly productive district. Rock-chip samples from artisanal workings near zones of strong chlorite-sericite alteration, indicate the presence of potentially mineralized structures. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement executed in 2022, LVG may receive up to US $45 million in contingent payments from Barrick, subject to future discoveries or defined resource thresholds on these licences. The results reinforce the geological continuity between the Bulyanhulu Mine and the Tembo Project area, validating LVG's long-standing interpretation of the belt's broader potential. "We are encouraged to see Barrick's sustained exploration momentum and technical validation across the Tembo-area licences," said Simon Benstead, Executive Chairman and CFO of Lake Victoria Gold. "Their work continues to confirm the fertility of this part of the Lake Victoria Goldfields, where LVG remains a significant stakeholder through both our adjacent 100%-owned Tembo Project and the contingent upside tied to future discoveries." This strategic exposure comes as LVG accelerates its fully permitted Imwelo Gold Project toward construction. The company recently commenced drilling at Area C, the highest-grade zone within the project located just 12 kilometers from AngloGold Ashanti's flagship Geita mine. The approximately 24-hole, 4,000-metre program at Area C is designed to finalize pit design, strengthen resource confidence, and test for extensions at what management views as the priority starting point for mining. Previous drilling at Area C has returned high-grade results, including 6.8 metres at 14.6 g/t gold from 32 metres and 2.0 metres at 7.5 g/t from 22 metres, confirming strong production potential. The drill mobilization follows LVGachieving a pivotal agreement in principle with the Government of Tanzania on the government's statutory minimum 16% free carried interest. This fulfills a core regulatory condition. Together with environmental approval of the Updated Environmental and Social Management Plan, the regulatory pathway is now cleared for construction advancement. Imwelo operates under a 10-year renewable mining license with metallurgical recoveries surpassing 90%. This translates to an exceptional 90 cents of recoverable value per dollar of contained gold. Critically, Lake Victoria Gold is targeting first gold within 12 months of breaking ground. Financial momentum accelerated in September as LVGofficially closed an oversubscribed $6 million financing alongside a $2 million concurrent private placement. Proceeds fund work programs satisfying conditions for a pre-paid forward purchase facility with Monetary Metals to finance mine construction capital. Beyond Imwelo, the Tembo Project delivers additional optionality. A planned 3,000m drilling program at Ngula 1 is scheduled, where historical intercepts of 28.57 g/t gold over 3 metres signal toll milling opportunity. The timing proves strategic. Lake Victoria Gold is mobilizing equipment at a fully permitted project in one of Africa's premier gold districts precisely when high-grade ounces command maximum value.

(TSX: FF) (OTCQX: FFMGF) is expanding its newly discovered Miroir target at its Duparquet Gold Project in Quebec's Abitibi region, with drill hole DUP25-064 returning 3.23 g/t Au over 25.9 m, including 11.20 g/t Au over 2.0 m and 10.16 g/t Au over 1.4 m. The company has completed approximately 16,000 m of drilling in 2025, with 20 holes totaling ~4,450 m at Miroir alone, extending mineralization to 100 m depth while expanding the interpreted geophysical fold target to a 140 m strike length. "The Miroir target continues to deliver new discoveries within the largely underexplored volcanic setting of the Duparquet Project," stated Dan Wilton, CEO of First Mining. "The strong grades and widths encountered to date provide new and exciting opportunities in our review of development scenarios that can now include near-surface, higher grade mineralization potential." Drilling at Miroir follows initial discovery hole DUP24-048, which returned 3.12 g/t Au over 19.35 m in 2024, with recent step-out hole DUP25-066 delivering 1.37 g/t Au over 30.6 m approximately 45 m east of the headline intercept. The Duparquet Project currently hosts 3.44 million ounces Au in the Measured & Indicated category at 1.55 g/t, plus 2.64 million ounces Inferred at 1.62 g/t across a 19 km strike along the prolific Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone. Andean Precious Metals Corp. (TSX: APM) (OTCQX: ANPMF) has expanded its 2025 exploration program at Golden Queen by an additional 3,800 metres following positive Phase 3 drilling results, with core holes at Hilltop intersecting 1.94 g/t Au and 27 g/t Ag over 4.4 m and 5.11 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag over 1.5 m, bringing total planned 2025 drilling to 8,100 metres. At San Bartolome in Bolivia, the company has secured environmental exploration permits and social licenses in partnership with COMIBOL under a long-term agreement to purchase up to 7.0 million tonnes of oxide ore, with 5,500 metres of shallow core drilling set to begin in Q4 2025 targeting approximately 800,000 tonnes grading 150-250 g/t Ag across multiple projects including Turqui, Tacobamba, Ánimas, Santa Isabel, and Trapiche. "Our exploration teams have made strong progress this year at both Golden Queen and San Bartolome," said Yohann Bouchard, President of Andean Precious Metals. "At Golden Queen, Phase 3 drilling has intersected encouraging mineralized intervals that confirm continuity and support potential mine-life extensions, while upcoming infill work at the Starlight Vein is designed to further expand Main Pit 2. In Bolivia, our partnership with COMIBOL is advancing multiple targets under a long-term ore supply agreement that secures access to up to 7 million tonnes of oxide ore. This program is designed to extend San Bartolome's mine life and maximize throughput of the existing 5,000 tpd mill without major capital spend." The Golden Queen program has drilled 3,903 metres across 20 core holes at Hilltop to date, with all holes intersecting projected low-sulfidation cryptocrystalline quartz veins that extend mineralization up to 280 metres along strike, while infill drilling at the Starlight Vein will support expansion of Main Pit 2, which is currently in production. The company anticipates releasing an updated mineral resource and reserve statement with supporting NI 43-101 technical report in the first half of 2026, integrating new geological data from the expanded drilling program that collectively positions Andean as a growing Americas-focused precious metals producer with quality assets across its California and Bolivia operations. U.S. GoldMining Inc. (NASDAQ: USGO) has successfully completed its 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Gold-Copper Project in Alaska, executing 169 scout auger drill holes across the 7.5 km by 4.5 km Whistler Orbit and completing systematic mapping and sampling at the Muddy Creek intrusion-related gold system. The program identified multiple new porphyry intrusive occurrences at top-of-bedrock and determined that much of the till overburden is shallower than previously interpreted, positioning drill-ready targets closer to surface across the 514 km² property located 150 km northwest of Anchorage. "We are pleased to have successfully completed our 2025 exploration program at the Whistler Project in line with our objective to develop a pipeline of targets for potential future discoveries that will underpin growth opportunities for the Project," said Tim Smith, Chief Executive Officer of U.S. GoldMining. "We also welcome the recent U.S. Federal decision to approve the Ambler Road in north central Alaska, which further supports our belief that the prevailing political tailwinds at all levels of government will help to expedite the successful permitting and ultimate development of the proposed West Susitna Access Road, which is expected to connect the Company's 100% owned Whistler Gold-Copper Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage, Alaska." The Whistler Project contains over 20 advanced gold and copper prospects including the Whistler and Raintree deposits, which host a combined mineral resource estimate of 294 Mt at 0.68 g/t AuEq for 6.48 Moz AuEq Indicated, plus 198 Mt at 0.65 g/t AuEq for 4.16 Moz AuEq Inferred. Mapping at Muddy Creek identified new zones of increased quartz vein density containing abundant to massive sulphides including antimony-bearing minerals, with 106 rock grab samples and 7 silt samples collected across a 5 km by 2.5 km area, with assays pending from both the Whistler Orbit scout drilling program and Muddy Creek surface sampling. Nova Minerals Limited (NASDAQ: NVA) has been engaged by Australian Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency The Hon Dr Kevin Rudd AC, to provide a comprehensive briefing on its Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project ahead of the October 20, 2025 meeting between Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington DC. The briefing follows the company's recent US$43.4 million award from the U.S. Department of War to accelerate development of a fully integrated U.S. antimony supply chain, targeting military-spec antimony production by 2026/27, with the Estelle Project's 514 km² land package hosting over 20 advanced gold and antimony prospects across a 35 km mineralized corridor in Alaska's Tintina Gold Belt. "Being invited to brief the Australian Government for this high-level meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump is a testament to the strategic importance of the Estelle Project," said Christopher Gerteisen, CEO of Nova Minerals. "With antimony recognized as a critical mineral and our gold resources adding significant value, Nova is well-positioned to contribute to both U.S. and Australian critical minerals strategies. The US$43.4 million DoW award and our secured land at Port MacKenzie underscore our commitment to building a secure, domestic supply chain for antimony and supporting U.S. defense and industrial needs." The company's proposed antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie, supported by a secured 42.81-acre land use permit, will produce antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide, and antimony metal for military and industrial applications. Nova's strategic positioning has been reinforced by antimony's inclusion on the U.S. Department of the Interior's Draft 2025 Critical Minerals List and the recent U.S. Federal Government approval of the Ambler Road, signaling increased policy support for responsible resource development in Alaska and alignment with the proposed West Susitna Access Road that would connect the Estelle Project to transportation infrastructure near Anchorage.

Title: Time To Book Profits In CRWD Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/27/time-to-book-profits-in-crwd-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-27T13:38:16Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CrowdStrike stock (NASDAQ: CRWD) has experienced an impressive performance, increasing by 10% in just the last week and hitting a peak of $522 on October 23, 2025. This surge has brought its year-to-date gains to an impressive 50%. The recent upward trend is primarily due to a series of analyst upgrades and increased price targets. This favorable sentiment follows the company's robust performance and strategic developments showcased at its recent Fal.Con event in September. With the stock currently valued around $520, investors are enjoying significant gains. The key question now is: After this remarkable rise, is CRWD stock still a worthwhile buy? While there are minimal fundamental concerns regarding CRWD stock, we view it as a costly choice at its current trade price of approximately $520. The major concern is that its current valuation seems very high. We arrived at this conclusion by comparing CRWD's present valuation with its operating performance over the past few years and its current and historical financial conditions. Our examination of CrowdStrike across essential metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company maintains a strong operating performance and financial situation, as elaborated below. That said, if you are looking for upside with reduced volatility than holding an individual stock like CRWD, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with less risk than the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let’s confront the obvious issue first – valuation. When evaluating the price per dollar of sales or cash flow, CrowdStrike appears extraordinarily expensive. These ratios imply that investors are paying a substantial premium for anticipated growth. The question arises whether that growth can warrant such elevated valuations. Here’s where the narrative takes an intriguing turn. CrowdStrike's revenue growth has been nothing less than impressive, making a strong argument for why investors might accept those elevated multiples. This persistent high-growth trajectory in the crucial cybersecurity sector indicates that CrowdStrike has discovered a successful model. The company continues to outpace the wider market significantly. This is where CrowdStrike's story becomes more intricate. In spite of remarkable revenue growth, conventional profitability metrics reveal a troubling situation. This contrast suggests that CrowdStrike is investing heavily in growth while generating solid cash flows. The company seems to be focusing on expanding market share over immediate profitability. Despite challenges to profitability, CrowdStrike's balance sheet is robust and offers essential flexibility for its growth strategy. What contributes to the strength of the balance sheet? The financial stability metrics are outstanding: This financial robustness enables CrowdStrike to persist with aggressive investments without being concerned about funding limitations. Assessing CrowdStrike's performance during downturns aids in understanding its resilience as a long-term investment. CrowdStrike tends to undergo more dramatic fluctuations but demonstrates substantial recovery capacity, likely due to the vital role of cybersecurity services. Check out our dashboard on – How Low Can CRWD Stock Really Go – for more information. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (the combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a proactive method to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during downturns, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. CrowdStrike poses a classic conflict between growth and value. The company merges outstanding growth with robust financial stability, categorizing it as a high-quality business. However, its current valuation around $520 seems excessive, even for a firm with such remarkable fundamentals. Naturally, we could be mistaken in our evaluation, and investors might continue to be willing to pay 30 times or more for CRWD stock revenues. Nonetheless, investors should also consider the associated risks. We believe that waiting for a more favorable entry point may be the better option, as the existing price seems to reflect a lot of anticipated future success.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (SHOP) shares have surged 21% in the last month and are currently priced at $172.95. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it may be advisable to lower exposure to SHOP shares at this time. Our main concern lies in the current valuation, as a price point of $121 may not be unattainable. We believe there is minimal risk in SHOP stock given its overall Strong operational performance and financial standing. However, due to its Very High valuation, the stock seems Relatively Expensive. Here is our analysis: SHOP stock has increased significantly lately, making it appear relatively expensive at this time. Although this might seem like a chance, there are substantial risks associated with investing in a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy, as practiced with Trefis High Quality Portfolio, offers considerable value. Additionally, contemplate how the long-term performance of your portfolio could be enhanced by including 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Let’s delve into the details of each of the factors evaluated, but first, for a quick overview: With a market capitalization of $224 Bil, Shopify delivers a global commerce platform that enables merchants to showcase, manage, promote, and sell products across various sales channels. This table illustrates how SHOP is growing in comparison to the broader market. For further details see: SHOP Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how SHOP's profitability compares against the broader market. For more details see: SHOP Operating Income Comparison SHOP has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. This assessment takes into account both (a) the magnitude of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic However, the risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even during favorable market conditions—consider events such as earnings announcements, business updates, and outlook changes. Review SHOP Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming benchmarks that include all three—S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it has been a smoother ride, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

AMD stock is on a record-breaking streak. It’s trading around $253 after a 6.5% surge Friday, up nearly 90% this year—thanks to major AI partnerships that have Wall Street buzzing. A game-changing OpenAI chip deal on October 6 sparked a 34% single-day jump. Then came an Oracle GPU order and an IBM quantum breakthrough, lifting AMD shares another 7–8%. Now, analysts are racing to catch up. Bank of America lifted its target to $300, HSBC to $310, and others into the high $200s.

Title: 24/7 Market News: VENU’s $350M McKinney Sunset Amphitheater Hitting Key Construction Milestones

October 27, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Oct. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and information, reports that the construction of VENU’s (NYSE American: VENU) $350 million Sunset Amphitheater in McKinney, Texas, is progressing on schedule, marking a major milestone in the company’s mission to redefine the live entertainment landscape through real estate–backed, community-integrated entertainment campuses. The state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat premium amphitheater is projected to begin its inaugural concert season in 2026, which could grow to more than 80 shows annually, in its first full year, featuring premier global talent. Strategically located at the intersection of US 75 and the Sam Rayburn Tollway, the Sunset Amphitheater sits within a 30-minute drive of nearly 4 million residents and just over an hour from almost 10 million people, one of the most lucrative and demographically dynamic catchment zones in the nation. The amphitheater’s 46-acre site is designed to function year-round with a multi-season configuration, hosting 20,000 attendees in warm months, and reconfiguring to seat 5,000 guests in the winter with heated flooring and a partially enclosed roof and wind walls to maintain comfort in colder weather. Key features include: A Model Designed for Scale Drawing on experience from its Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, VENU continues to refine its construction process to deliver on-demand fulfillment of premium entertainment facilities with increased speed and efficiency. This approach underpins the Company’s growing portfolio, now over $5 billion in total pipeline, with $1.3 billion currently under construction across multiple states and 38 municipalities actively negotiating for future campuses. “From day one, we’ve been clear about how we intend to fund expansion — through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks,” said CEO and Chairman J.W. Roth. “Our growth is accelerating faster than we expected, and the foundation we’ve laid is designed for scale.” FireSuites: The Backbone of VENU’s Expansion Central to VENU’s business model are its Luxe FireSuites, real estate–backed, triple-net-leased VIP ownership experiences offering an anticipated 11% cap rate. Each FireSuite accommodates four to ten guests, featuring VIP entry, premium parking, and in-suite hospitality. Sales momentum remains strong: $23 million in FireSuite revenue booked in just 60 days, up 250% year-over-year, with company-wide inventory nearly 49% sold across Tulsa ($80M), McKinney ($147M), and El Paso ($106M). Economic and Institutional Tailwinds According to D Magazine, the McKinney project is expected to generate $3.8 billion in local economic impact over the next decade. The project also benefits from growing institutional confidence, Vanguard Group and 23 other institutions now hold nearly 5% of VENU’s float, signaling market recognition of its scalable, asset-backed model. With strategic partnerships spanning Tixr (ticketing), AEG Presents (touring), Aramark (hospitality), Ryan LLC (PPP structuring), and Sands Investment Group (sales), VENU continues to execute on a low-debt, high-leverage growth model that generates recurring revenue before the first ticket is even sold. Looking Ahead As the live music industry is projected by Goldman Sachs to grow at a 7.2% compound annual rate through 2030, VENU’s focus on premium, flexible, and artist-friendly venues places it at the epicenter of this expansion. The McKinney Sunset Amphitheater is the blueprint for the next era of experiential entertainment.

Wall Street is back in rally mode. The US stock market today is surging as investors cheer signs of a possible Trump-Xi trade deal. Dow futures are up 250 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip. He’s set to meet China’s President Xi on Thursday, and early talks hint at “a substantial framework” for an agreement, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.
