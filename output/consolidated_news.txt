(File image: Reuters/Dado Ruvic) SAN FRANCISCO: AMD will supply artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI in a multi-year deal that would bring in tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and give the ChatGPT creator the option to buy up to roughly 10 per cent of the chipmaker. Shares of the chipmaker surged more than 34 per cent on Monday (Oct 6), putting them on track for their biggest one-day gain in over nine years and adding roughly US$80 billion to the company's market value. The deal, latest in a string of investment commitments, underscores OpenAI and the broader AI industry's voracious appetite for computing power as companies race toward developing AI technology that meets or exceeds human intelligence. "We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry," AMD executive vice president Forrest Norrod told Reuters on Sunday.

AMD executives expect the deal to net tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Because of the ripple effect of the agreement, AMD expects to receive more than US$100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers, they said. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of US$32.78 billion this year, according to LSEG data. In contrast, analysts are expecting Nvidia to report revenue of US$206.26 billion for the current fiscal year. "AMD has really trailed Nvidia for quite some time. So I think it helps validate their technology," said Leah Bennett, chief investment strategist at Concurrent Asset Management. Shares of Nvidia dipped more than 1 per cent. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the AMD deal will help his startup build enough AI infrastructure to meet its needs. It was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the massive deal. OpenAI, which is valued at US$500 billion, generated around US$4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 and burned through US$2.5 billion in cash, according to media reports. As part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant that gives OpenAI the ability to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD for 1 cent each over the course of the chip deal. The warrant vests in tranches based on milestones that the two companies have agreed on. The first tranche will vest after the initial shipment of MI450 chips set for the second half of 2026. The remaining milestones include specific AMD stock price targets that escalate to US$600 a share for the final installment of stock to unlock. In September, Nvidia announced a deal to supply OpenAI with at least 10 gigawatts worth of its systems. In contrast with the startup's deal with AMD where it will take a stake in the chipmaker, Nvidia will invest US$100 billion in the ChatGPT parent under the terms of the agreement announced in September. Taking a stake in AMD could give OpenAI "the power to potentially influence corporate strategy. With Nvidia, OpenAI is simply the client and not a part-owner," said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell. OpenAI has worked with AMD for years, providing inputs on the design of older generations of AI chips such as the MI300X. The San Francisco-based AI company has been taking a number of steps to ensure it has the chips needed for its future needs. Altman has floated expectations of reaching 250 gigawatts of compute in total by 2033, The Information has reported. OpenAI's deal last month with Nvidia includes the deployment of one gigawatt of the chip giant's next-generation Vera Rubin processors in late 2026. OpenAI is also in the process of developing its own silicon for AI use and has partnered with Broadcom, Reuters reported last year. The startup and its main backer, Microsoft, announced last month that they had signed a non-binding agreement to restructure OpenAI into a for-profit entity. A person familiar with the matter said the deal with AMD does not change any of OpenAI's ongoing compute plans, including that effort or its partnership with Microsoft.

Title: Morgan Stanley’s new investment guidance could channel up to $80B into Bitcoin

Morgan Stanley now likens Bitcoin to digital gold and advises up to 4% allocation for growth portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee has issued new guidance encouraging investors to dedicate a small but deliberate portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The bank’s analysts now view the world’s largest crypto as a “scarce asset similar to digital gold,” recommending an allocation of 2% to 4% depending on risk appetite. Given that Morgan Stanley’s GIC oversees strategy for about 16,000 financial advisors managing roughly $2 trillion in client wealth, even modest adoption could introduce tens of billions in new inflows to Bitcoin. Consequently, the bank’s recommendation could translate to as much as $40 to $80 billion in potential fresh investment into BTC. Exhibit 12: GIC Recommendations for Maximum Cryptocurrency Allocations in Multiasset Portfolios According to the guidance, investors with Opportunistic Growth portfolios (i.e., those comfortable with greater volatility) can hold up to 4% in Bitcoin or similar digital assets. Meanwhile, those with Balanced Growth strategies are advised to keep exposure below 2%, while portfolios focused on preserving capital or generating income should avoid crypto entirely. Still, GIC cautioned that Bitcoin could experience sharper swings during macroeconomic stress, though it acknowledged that the asset’s volatility has significantly reduced in recent years. Nonetheless, this decision reflects a shift in tone from the firm’s earlier caution, when crypto exposure was limited to select high-net-worth clients. Under that framework, qualified investors with at least $1.5 million in net worth and a high risk tolerance were allowed to invest in Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley’s recommendation perfectly illustrates the broader reappraisal of digital assets within the traditional financial ecosystem. The bank’s view now aligns with that of BlackRock, which argued that allocating up to 2% of a diversified portfolio to Bitcoin is a “reasonable” approach for long-term investors. Similarly, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has argued that a small Bitcoin position can function as an inflation hedge, comparable to gold, due to its finite supply. Industry observers see these shifts as a cultural turning point that would spark further adoption and growth for the emerging asset class. Samuel Grisanzio, chief marketing officer at Wolf Financial, said: “The shift from ‘stay away’ to ‘flexibly allocate’ in traditional wealth management language is absolutely massive for adoption honestly.” That evolution follows growing client demand since the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Those products unlocked easier access to the asset and helped propel its price past $125,000, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.

Business Insider's editors make the final selections. This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance. Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections. This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

Title: What happens when C-suit pay becomes all or nothing

Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter. Could staking your compensation on an all-or-nothing bet make you a better leader—or just a higher-stakes gambler? That question is resurfacing in boardrooms as “moonshot” pay packages gain traction among CEOs and boards seeking to inspire extraordinary performance and lock in ambitious talent, writes my colleague Amanda Gerut. The concept, first thrust into the spotlight by Elon Musk’s 2018 Tesla deal, has reemerged in striking fashion through Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprise, the maker of Taser stun guns and police body cameras. In 2018, Smith accepted an unconventional offer: no bonuses, no meaningful salary (just $31,000 a year), and no equity unless he could grow Axon’s market cap tenfold over the next decade. Each $1 billion increase unlocked a tranche of stock, with the ultimate goal of lifting the company’s value from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. It was a daring bet, but one that paid off. Within five years, Smith had blown past each goal and became the highest-paid CEO in America in 2024 with $165 million in compensation. The stock surged more than 600%. Moonshot packages invert the standard logic of executive pay. Instead of the usual mix of salary, annual bonuses, and performance shares, they tie virtually all potential compensation to long-term milestones, often at seemingly impossible levels. Advocates argue that they strengthen alignment with shareholders, encourage long-term thinking, and inject urgency into the transformation process. Smith even extended a version of his plan to Axon employees, allowing them to trade portions of their pay for stock that vested alongside his. But the approach is not without controversy. The plans are highly volatile, difficult to calibrate, and often unpopular with investors wary of oversized payouts or asymmetric risk. Miss the mark, and the CEO gets nothing. Hit it too quickly, and shareholders may accuse boards of overpaying. Still, the model is spreading because, the rationale goes, extraordinary results demand extraordinary incentives, and in a market obsessed with innovation and valuation multiples, big bets may be the price of attracting and retaining elite executive talent. Whether these moonshots create enduring value or prove to be flashes of fortune remains an open question. What’s clear is that they represent a new frontier in corporate risk-taking—one that fuses pay, purpose, and performance into a single, high-stakes wager on leadership itself.

Title: Will RBI’s push for bank-funded acquisitions turn private credit's feast into famine?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: A recent regulatory change proposing banks enter into acquisition financing could potentially disrupt the fast-growing private credit industry in pricing and deal-picking, and over the long term transform the way deals are structured, according to sector experts. The Reserve Bank of India, as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released alongside the monetary policy statement on October 1 proposed allowing banks to fund corporate buyouts. At a broader level, the RBI’s proposal is “very proactive and progressive" and is expected to go a long way in reducing the cost and enhancing availability of capital pools for individuals and corporates, said Bhavdeep Bhatt, chief executive officer of Northern Arc Investments. Private credit growth has been strong in 2025. Total private credit deployment touched $9 billion across 79 deals in the first half of calendar 2025—a 53% jump from the first half of 2024 and close to three times the value for the latter half of 2024, a report by EY in August noted. The biggest of deals was the $3.1 billion raised by Porteast Investment of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group—the biggest onshore private credit transaction in India to date. Indian private credit players include Kotak Alternative Asset Management, 360 One, Avendus Capital, and Edelweiss Funds, among others; international players include Blackrock, Blackstone, KKR, Abudhabi Investment Authority, and several others. A key factor for the growth of the private credit market in India until now has been the RBI’s restrictions on banks providing acquisition finance, said Geeta Chugh, managing director, sector lead, financial services ratings at S&P Global Ratings. Longer term impactThe proposed entry of banks, with their relatively larger balance sheets and readiness to lend amid muted corporate growth, could potentially result in lower yields, looser terms, and weaker collateral structures. In some cases, enforcing collateral or ensuring debt coverage may be weaker than with traditional bank loans, other experts told Mint. Still, in the short to medium term, the overall impact on private credit funds is expected to be small, given the limited ability and skill sets of banks to fund complex deals and the flexibility at private credit firms on with customisations and value-addition. Private credit funds command superior returns because they offer customised funding structures—tailored for complexity, risk, scale and quick turnarounds. Bound by tight regulations, banks often lack flexibility and are likely to be limited to larger, simpler, and less risky transactions, said Ashwin Patni, head, wealth management services, Julius Baer. Most takers for private credit deals are mid-market corporates who require a nimble approach. Also Read | Buy now, pay later is surfing the private credit wave "Acquisition financing is just a small slice of the private credit pie, so any minor capital shift toward banks will not impact the broader opportunity set," said Patni. But, the crucial difference could be in how deals are structured with the entry of banks. Cost of fundingBanks with their lower cost of funds will have the advantage of lower pricing, something that private credit funds cannot compete with, experts said, adding that the latter will also then have to look at what value proposition they offer clients. Private credit currently prices at 14-17% IRR, and if banks are permitted to finance acquisitions, they could come in at a materially lower cost—around 10–12% all-in, given their access to low-cost deposits, said Atul Thakkar, executive director, Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Raghunath T, senior portfolio manager at Vivriti Asset Management, believes that this pricing dynamic is sustainable given that investor allocations to private credit have grown regardless of rate or liquidity considerations and driven by consistent outperformance compared to public debt markets. What’s more is that the deal flow for private credit funds is diversified across sectors, he said, adding that typically, sectors with M&As and extraordinarily high growth seek credit solutions from private credit funds. “Today, a lot of infrastructure platforms across renewable energy, transportation and high-growth segments like electronics manufacturing and logistics are contributing to a large share of the deal flow," Raghunath said. Red flagsDespite the proposed RBI norms expected to open up capital for acquisition financing, some market participants remain sceptical and warn that this comes with a higher risk of bank exposure to certain corporates. Also Read | Private credit is booming business. Where one pro sees risks and opportunities. While bank loans would likely carry tighter covenants and security packages compared to private credit, the only risk factor is the need for the central bank to set an overall limit on how much exposure each bank can take on in the private credit segment, said Thakkar of Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Others worry that if banks are allowed to finance acquisitions, it could lead to indirect promoter funding through backdoor loans, and without clear rules, acquisition finance might be misused. Regulators would likely require strict monitoring to ensure funds are not for equity buybacks or share pledges. “The systemic risk is limited right now because private credit is still a small slice compared to total bank lending," said Vishal Bansal, partner, debt and special situations, EY India. Risks such as asset quality deterioration could emerge if funds loosen standards to win deals or liquidity mismatches crop up if investors want to exit before loans mature, he cautioned. But Nilesh Dhedhi, MD & CEO, Avendus Finance Private Ltd ruled out systemic risks pointing to the fact that private credit assets under management (AUM) is not even 1% of total banking AUM. Besides, he said: “Private credit looks at risk… mostly in micro terms rather than macro terms [as banks do]. There are also very specific risk-driven analysis for a particular company or situations rather than a standardised approach [at banks]." The proposed entry of banks, with their relatively larger balance sheets and readiness to lend amid muted corporate growth, could potentially result in lower yields, looser terms, and weaker collateral structures. In some cases, enforcing collateral or ensuring debt coverage may be weaker than with traditional bank loans, other experts told Mint.

French investment firm Ardian is buying one of Ireland's largest energy utilities Energia Group in a deal that values the firm at more than €2.5 billion, betting on a power supplier poised to serve the surging artificial intelligence industry. Ardian has agreed to buy Energia Group from infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. I Squared Capital had acquired the company in 2016 for €1 billion. The companies said today's deal will have no impact on Energia's customers, employees, partners or suppliers, adding that Energia remains committed to delivering on its strategy and supporting Ireland's sustainable energy future. The deal underscores surging investor interest in data centres that cater to the booming market for AI tools and power their growing adoption across the globe. BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is nearing a deal to acquire Aligned Data Centers that could value the data centre operator at around $40 billion, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Energia represents Ardian's first deal in Ireland. Energia owns onshore wind farms with a capacity of 358 mega watts, supplies gas and electricity to over 898,000 clients and employs 1,117 people, according to its website. It supplies about 17% of the island of Ireland's total electricity requirements and 20% of its total wind power. "Energia's focus remains on transforming Ireland's energy system by deploying renewables and other low carbon solutions at scale, while continuing to deliver secure and affordable energy to our domestic and commercial customers. We are grateful for I Squared’s support over the past nine years and the strong, future-ready platform we have built together," its CEO Ian Thom said. "Ireland is at a pivotal point, with rapid electrification, growing demand from new technologies, and global investment in digital infrastructure all accelerating. Energia is ideally placed to meet these needs, and with Ardian's long-term backing, we’re excited to continue scaling our business to help power this next phase of Ireland’s growth for our customers, partners and employees," he added. "We are proud to be investing in Energia, which marks Ardian’s first investment in Ireland. The company has demonstrated its market leadership in Ireland and Northern Ireland over many years and has ambitious plans to grow, driven by secured capital projects and increasing energy demand," Juan Angoitia, Ardian's co-head of infrastructure Europe and senior managing director said. "Ardian is a highly experienced investor in essential infrastructure and European utilities. We have been impressed by Energia's strong growth and resilience in the context of a volatile energy market, and look forward to sharing our expertise to further develop its renewable generation portfolio, flexible capacity and enhance the efficiency of the whole company, " he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Govt Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook: What Keeps Equities Buoyant? Ben Powell Explains

The ongoing US government shutdown has so far been overshadowed by the “AI megaforce,” which continues to provide huge tailwinds for equities, said Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “It’s hard to say how long this will persist. Sometimes it lasts longer than a week,” Powell told NDTV Profit in an interaction, adding that economists are “flying blind” without the usual flow of data. “Last Friday should have been weekly initial jobless claims numbers, job reports data, nonfarm payrolls data— but we did not have any numbers. The implication is that it makes life difficult for all of us, and critically for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed no longer has access to cutting-edge data,” he said. Powell noted that the lack of updates was "not at all helpful for people trying to assess the economic outlook." The US government shut down after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a funding agreement by Oct.1 deadline, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees facing furloughs and forcing many offices to close. During a shutdown, federal agencies cannot spend money beyond essential emergencies, meaning all “nonessential” functions are suspended until Congress restores funding. The disruption has already delayed the release of payroll data, deepening uncertainty around the economic outlook. Still, swap traders remain confident that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with another quarter-point interest rate cut in October, according to Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown continued with unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asking a judge to immediately block any mass firings by the Trump administration, the report further added. On the other hand, gold rose to another record — closing in on the $4,000 an ounce mark — as the US Federal government shutdown dragged on. "Rates traders are still pricing in a quarter-point cut for the end of the month, which will benefit gold further as it doesn’t pay interest," Bloomberg report added.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.mkvtw6t3n Share article Print article There is a buzz of anticipation around Chris Kraus’ latest novel The Four Spent the Day Together, following the success of the television adaption of her postmodern feminist cult classic I Love Dick (1997). Review: The Four Spent the Day Together – Chris Kraus (Scribe) Kraus’ novels to this point have all been self-referential. The typical Kraus novel, as she recently explained, provides a fictionalised “case study of my life”. She writes what literary academic Mira Mattar calls “unconstrained, disobedient texts”, using “her own most immediately available raw material”. Though Kraus resists the term “autofiction”, she is interested in testing the limits of memoir, unsettling fact and fiction to deliver provocative commentaries on contemporary American culture. Her work combines high and low cultural elements with postmodern play, drawing on influences such as philosopher Jean Baudrillard and writer Kathy Acker, about whom she has written a landmark biography. This time, however, Kraus has added a true-crime twist, a move that changes the stakes of her novel’s biting social commentary. The Four Spent the Day Together is arguably Kraus’s most conceptually ambitious, formally interesting, and politically charged novel to date. Written in three historically overlapping sections, spanning the 1960s to the 2020s, it pursues new directions for her writing. The novel traces the tensions of everyday life in a declining global superpower. Its themes range from the rise of neoliberal greed, gentrification and the prison-industrial complex, to the toxic cloud of reactionary politics, censorship and cancel-culture that has settled over a twitterised America, including its literary culture. The Four Spent the Day Together initially presents itself as the story of an artist named Catt Greene – Kraus’ fictional alter ego, who is also the author of a book called I Love Dick. Readers will recall her from Kraus’ 2012 novel Summer of Hate (where she is named Catt Dunlop). The first section reads as a coming-of-age novel about Catt’s rebellious teenage years growing up in Milford, Connecticut. The second section is a work of thinly veiled autofiction about the pressures of Catt’s life as a middle-aged writer married to a recovering addict. In its final section, The Four Spent the Day Together becomes a “true-crime novel”. The move allows Catt to decentre herself, write about issues that fall well outside her usual field of vision as an artist. She sees parallels between her life and some teenagers involved in a meth-fuelled murder case. In exposing the similarities, Kraus deftly allegorises how poverty, racism and political corruption produce cycles of inequality for working-class Americans. Beginning in Milford during the turbulent 1960s, The Four Spent the Day Together adopts that era’s key slogan. It shows how “the personal is political”. Kraus reflects on the gentrification of Brooklyn, which prices Catt’s parents out of their working-class neighbourhood. The family moves to suburban Milford, where extreme economic inequality also predominates, despite the differences from the city. Catt’s father spends most of his days away at work in Cambridge University Press’s Manhattan office. Her mother remains at home caring for their two children, a housewife suffering from what second-wave feminist Betty Friedan called the “unspoken” problem haunting middle-class white women. Her sister Carla is struggling with a misdiagnosed developmental disability, which the precocious Catt openly resents, leading her to act out. Swept up in her generation’s spirit of rebelliousness, Catt becomes involved in the counterculture of sit-ins, drugs, motorcycles and radical politics. The novel then lurches forward in time to focus on Catt’s career as a writer and creative-writing professor, and on her relationships. Politics again rears its head in the characters’ everyday lives. Catt and her first husband, an older French philosophy professor (a principal character in I Love Dick), protest against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney’s infernal war in the Middle East and the reign of “antiterrorist” terror – one agenda of which was to crush political dissent by policing antiwar protesters. Political solidarity draws Catt to her second husband Paul Garcia (who also appears in Summer of Hate). Paul has served a trumped-up three-year prison sentence following a drug-fuelled crime spree, in which he stole $900 from a corporation Cheney had invested in. Catt and her first husband sponsor Paul to undertake a psychology degree, as he struggles to turn his life around. As Catt’s open marriage withers, she and Paul purchase a vacation house in rural Balsam, Minnesota: the land of Bob Dylan’s North Country Blues. Catt hopes to secure a creative retreat from the bustle of Los Angeles. Paul seeks a refuge from the difficulties of his social work in the city’s poorest, most desperate neighbourhoods. The longer they spend in the sublimely beautiful landscape of northern Minnesota, the more they become exposed to its dark enigmas. Once an iron-ore powerhouse, the post-industrial Iron Range is now a region in decline. Clinging to myths of a lost era of prosperity, it has become a MAGA stronghold of deeply encrusted conservatism, stark economic inequalities and rampant addiction. An epidemic of methamphetamines (or “hillbilly heroin” as it was dubbed in the 2000s) has spiralled out of control. The locale proves unhelpful to Paul’s recovery. A shift to his perspective in this section is crucial for the novel’s personalisation of politics. Paul is a working-class American from a racial minority and a mental health support worker. His life has been one of hardship. His perspective ties the book’s threads of political commentary together. A harrowing career counselling troubled youths and addicts, while struggling with his own recovery from addiction, leads him into a downward spiral: drink-driving offences, job layoffs and marital breakdown. The novel’s final section, set in the late 2010s, finds Catt grappling with the prospect of a second divorce. At this point, she learns of a murder trial in nearby Hibbing, Minnesota. Three teenagers are accused of conspiring to murder an acquaintance while under the influence of crystal meth. Their families, law enforcement, the community, Catt, and even the suspects themselves fail to understand their motives. Attempting to escape her personal and professional troubles, Catt becomes obsessed with the investigating the case. Rather than focus on the innocence or guilt of the accused, she studies their childhood experiences of poverty, broken homes, abuse and undiagnosed disability. In preparing this novel, Kraus conducted over 100 interviews with individuals who were in some way connected to the crime. It is worth noting that her publisher has heavily promoted this final section, going so far as to call The Four Spent the Day Together a “true crime” novel, even though this subplot does not materialise until the final third of the book. What is the upshot of this sudden detour into “true-crime fiction”? What are the implications of thinking about the book in this way? “Crimes are like books,” Kraus reflected in a recent interview, in that a “crime brackets life in the same way that a novel brackets time, and within the brackets you can start to study different flows”. This can lead to “a belated understanding of the whole systemic injustice that led to the situation in the first place”. Reading backwards from this point, we might trace how Kraus’s has plotted her personal history in a way that foreshadows the novel’s turning point. First, she probes her family’s troubles with depression and disability, and her own youthful experiments with recreational drugs and petty crime. Then she considers the difficulties of living with a spouse who is attempting to turn his life around but is caught at every turn, stigmatised as a felon and addict within a judicial system that racially profiles him. By refocusing the story around the lives of a group of kids before and after they commit an atrocious crime, Kraus challenges herself to “see things from the character’s point of view, not my point of view” in order to “psychically penetrate the mindscape of these kids and how they see things”. Incorporating investigative materials into a literary reconstruction of those characters and events, she explores the parallels between her history and theirs. What can a grisly meth-fuelled murder in northern Minnesota’s Iron Range tell us about post-industrial decline and the malaises of drug addiction, poverty and rising right-wing conservatism? Taking a leaf out of Truman Capote’s book (specifically, his “non-fiction novel” In Cold Blood), Kraus blends journalism with autofiction to explore how these characters’ lives are contoured by historical ruptures brought about by political struggles. Catt’s investigations into what pushed three teenagers to murder an acquaintance in cold blood lead to more urgent questions regarding what has gone so terribly wrong in American life. In a sense, Kraus is not writing a book about a crime, but about what a crime can teach us about what books do. For if books are like crimes, as she claims, then writing can be understood as means of “investigating things” by “looking a little deeper than people look in the course of an anesthetized daily life”. “The pleasure of reading is that the writer has looked that far and is telling you things that you either didn’t know or you knew in some subliminal way,” she explains. “The function of writing is to give thoughts and feelings a voice, and to bring them forward to articulate them.” On one level, the unexpected third section of the novel is Kraus using “true-crime fiction” to expose her culture’s inability to grapple with these sorts of issues. Kraus’ cult following includes major contemporary writers such as Sheila Heti, Rachel Kushner and Maggie Nelson, as well as celebrities Lena Dunham and Alexa Chung. But some readers will likely not agree with all Kraus has to say. She is razor-sharp about literary critics, within a wider satire of cultural criticism in the age of social media. Through Catt, Kraus also reflects on the strange consequences of becoming famous after the television adaptation of I Love Dick. At first, Catt is regarded as a trailblazing “older white feminist” and a forebear of the #MeToo movement. But she soon draws ire for refusing to boycott a Los Angeles artists’ collective accused of tacitly supporting the gentrification of working-class Chicano suburbs. Kraus here turns her satirical gaze back onto privileged but unaware Ivy League students and other commentators, who picketed her speaking events at NYU when she was promoting her Acker biography. In Summer of Hate, she wrote about her experiences investing in and restoring dilapidated apartment complexes in the 2000s. The project aimed at increasing decent and affordable housing for low-income families. In The Four Spent the Day Together, Catt (like Kraus) finds herself likened to coldblooded property investors like the Trump family – “slumlords” who profit from ruthless campaigns of racial redlining and gentrification (see Woody Guthrie’s classic song about the shady dealings and racism of his landlord Fred Trump for a concise account). Without knowing her, the protesters accuse Catt of “racially fetishising” her husband. Revisiting these scandals could, on one level, be dismissed as merely defensive. But Kraus also uses these uncomfortable experiences to develop an incisive social commentary on the toxic twitterisation of politics and culture. She draws attention to the contradictions and reactionary tendencies of social media and online communities, as well as the dangerous effects of censorship when these tendencies migrate into the sphere of literature and criticism. Kraus has said that, in writing this novel, she hoped it might provide “a window into what the culture and consciousness is outside of the intellectual worlds in mainstream America”. This is, she observed, “not something that’s looked at much in high art” in the United States. The Four Spent the Day Together, however, achieves precisely that. It culminates in a vision of cultural vacuity, rampant political corruption, overpolicing and mass incarceration – and public health and welfare systems that fail to provide adequate safety nets for individuals or support for communities in crisis. Instead of an autobiography with a true-crime novel tacked on, we are left with a sobering allegory of America’s contradictions and its longstanding political inequalities. Kraus describes how these have deepened and morphed into new, frightening shapes over the past 60 years. Provocative yet unflinching, The Four Spent the Day Together promises to ignite difficult conversations about what has led to the culture and politics of Trump’s America 2.0.

Title: India Well-Positioned For Equity Upside; Bitcoin, Gold Strong Hedge, Says BlackRock's Ben Powell

At a time when global investors have been cautious, India's equity market stands out as one of the most promising opportunities for investors in the coming quarters, according to Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “India has an important part to play in portfolios going forward,” Powell said, adding that the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong despite headwinds from global trade dynamics. “It has had a few quarters buffeted by U.S. trade dynamics. Looking forward, I am optimistic about Indian equities. There seems to be a general lack of enthusiasm from global investors, and I think that presents opportunities for us as investors to pick our spots,” he said. Powell added that India's macro environment looks good while the economy is supported by low inflation and the room for the Reserve Bank of India to issue further rate cuts. "The Indian economy continues to be resilient from a macro context. Inflation is pretty low, thus giving the RBI room for rate cuts. That’s a good starting point for Indian equities to do better in the coming quarters,” he said. Powell's comments on India comes against the backdrop of the US government shutdown and an uncertain macro environment. But despite the immediate headwind linked to the US government shutdown, Powell believes the AI-driven "megaforce" will be supporting the markets. “This kind of confusion has been overwhelmed by the ongoing AI megaforce, which continues to be a huge tailwind for markets,” he said, adding that investors should also think about hard assets such as copper, given the energy demands that will come with large-scale AI and electrification trends. Powell went on to talk about portfolio diversification, adding that gold and Bitcoin, which recently touched the $125,000 mark for the first time, could be excellent hedges against ongoing volatility. “Commodities can play a part in a well-diversified portfolio,” he said. “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin, for example, could make sense. The same goes for Gold."

October 05, 2025 20:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 23rd issue of our Weekly Report. Let’s start with a major piece of positive news over the weekend: the Trump administration is reportedly considering a significant tariff reduction for the major automobile producers in the United States, if they produce or assemble their cars in the United States. If implemented, this policy would bring tangible benefits to the U.S. advanced manufacturing and automotive industries. It would not only ease cost pressures for domestic manufacturers but also send a clear signal of America’s strong commitment to supporting local innovation and manufacturing. For FF and FX, it could be of great significance: First, it would bring more flexibility to the pricing and profitability model of FX Super One and other products in the North American market; second, it would be tantamount to a vote of confidence in the U.S. automotive industry and could further enhance the confidence of the capital market and partners in the long-term development of FF and FX. Our Government Relations team has been actively engaging in constructive dialogue since the Trump administration imposed higher tariffs in April this year. We believe tariff reduction should be the right direction for both industrial development and policy guidance. Here's how the week progressed: On EAI Flywheel, S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: After multiple rounds of discussions, reviews, and alignment, we have finalized the U.S. production assembly plan for FX Super One. Our bridge partners and supply chain collaborators will now commence component supply for the production assembly phase, as the entire team pushes toward the milestone of rolling out the first U.S.-version FX Super One by year-end. This marks not only a critical milestone toward achieving our target but also one of the most essential components in the entire mass-production system. The production assembly plan will have a major impact on vehicle delivery cost and efficiency and will play a decisive role in driving cost optimization and operational efficiency across the product’s full lifecycle. Based on the finalized plan, we are confident in the potential of the FX Super One. At the same time, as one of the most complex phases in executing the Bridge Strategy, the component supply system has also reached its initial completion. We extend our sincere appreciation to the entire FX team for their dedicated efforts and to our bridge partners for their strong support. Beyond finalizing the production assembly plan, Super One has also been undergoing ongoing testing, development, and validation in both the U.S. and UAE. With the UAE final launch set for October 28 and deliveries commencing as early as November, our global teams are working intensively to support the regional operation in completing all pre-launch preparations. This week, validation of key third-party applications for the UAE version of Super One was successfully completed. On S6 Middle East: This week, FF was invited to participate in WETEX 2025 in the Middle East. Both the FF 91 and FX Super One were showcased, receiving high praise and strong purchase interest from members of the UAE and Dubai royal families as well as senior government officials. This was not only a product showcase, but also a demonstration of our systematic solutions for future mobility, energy, and sustainability. It marks a solid step forward in our strategic third pole in the Middle East. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up:Three new leaders recently joined FF - Deputy GC, Head of IR, and Head of Finance. Their arrival will further strengthen our expertise in legal affairs, capital markets communication, and financial management. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: This week, we successfully closed a strategic investment in Nasdaq-listed QLGN. Based on the closing price on the day of transaction closing, FF’s $30M investment in QLGN reflected a nearly 140% unrealized gain. If approved at the stockholders’ meeting, QLGN will be rebranded as CXC10 and is expected to officially launch its new Crypto and Web3 business. The CXC10 company is expected to focus on six core products under the “Three Growth Engines.” The C10 Treasury from the first Growth Engine—C10, is expected to begin asset allocation on the Top 10 crypto coins next week.As Chief Advisor, I will provide comprehensive consultation to the board of CXC10, and support and empower the team and the company, particularly in the areas of product, AI, user ecosystem development, strategy, HR, and corporate AI management system. Globally, this week’s surge in Crypto markets and the excitement of Token2049 once again validated the forward-looking nature of our Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. The meta-chemistry of Web2 and Web3 is not only about the convergence of software and hardware, virtual and physical, but also about the convergence of financial ecosystems and mobility ecosystems, artificial intelligence and Crypto. I believe this could unlock greater value creation for FFAI. Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions over the week.Last week, one of our satellite office buildings at HQ experienced a fire incident. Fortunately, no one was injured. Nevertheless, this incident serves as a reminder for FF’s facility fire prevention efforts. We will make necessary improvements and adjustments to further strengthen our safety system and eliminate potential risks. Looking ahead to the next week: We will continue to focus on FX Super One’s U.S. production readiness and UAE delivery preparation. Also, we expect to host the “Drive Home Together” co-creation event for Super One and FF 91. Thank you all, and we'll see you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

More Info A couple of years ago, a cross-section of Wall Street was highly bullish on the community solar sector, with some predicting that it was poised to become the most prevalent model of residential solar power distribution in the United States. First unveiled about two decades ago, community solar entails a small-scale solar model wherein customers purchase shares in a new solar farm in their service area, developers build the project then subscribers receive credits that cut their utility bills by ~10%. Community solar offers a viable solution to the roughly half of American households that are unable to install rooftop solar due to factors like roof shading, issues with property ownership or specific regulations. Further, these solar projects tend to offer friendlier contract terms for people with lower credit scores. Unfortunately, the community solar boom could be over before it has even properly begun. A fresh report by global data, research, and consulting services provider, WoodMackenzie, has revealed that U.S. community solar installations dropped 36% year over year in the first half of the current year, with just 437 MW installed, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. OBBBA gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects, with the bill’s impact expected to get worse as the years roll on. WoodMac is now decidedly bearish on the sector, and expects community solar installations to contract 12% annually through 2030. Total U.S. community solar installations clocked in at 9.1 GW at the end of June 2025, and are projected to exceed 16 GW by 2030. Wood Mackenzie does not see much upside in the sector, and has predicted that installations could exceed the forecast figure by 1.3 GW on favorable state policy while further tax credit complications could lower the outlook by 1.2 GW. “The final bill offers a crucial four-year window for projects already under development to come online and secure the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), supporting near-term buildout,” Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told PV Magazine. “As of mid-2025, there are over 9 GW of community solar projects under development, with over 1.4 GW known to be under construction,” she added. Related: OPEC+: Reuters Leaks on Oil Plans Again Wood Mackenzie has attributed this year’s big decline to falling volumes in New York and in Maine, after the former program was recently overhauled. New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation. Solar Stocks Shine Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to outperform, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has comfortably outpaced its oil and gas peers, returning 40.5% in the year-to-date compared to 4.2% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 14.8% gain by the S&P 500. OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA, with the stock up 33.6% YTD. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar’s finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, is are key component of this expansion. Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) leads the sector with YTD returns of 172.4%. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir says the company’s multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years. Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) has surged 107.8% YTD thanks to the company’s robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate in its latest quarter. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the second quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase, while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company’s total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30. A new conflict in the Middle East... a surprise OPEC+ decision... a massive shift in Chinese demand. Most investors only react to the headlines.

ByRob Toews, Contributor. We stand at the cusp of a massive technology paradigm shift that promises to transform human civilization. Sam Altman and Elon Musk are building rival companies to compete over what will be one of the biggest market opportunities in history. No, we are not talking about generative AI. We are not talking about OpenAI and xAI. We are talking about brain-computer interfaces. Musk’s Neuralink and Altman’s newly launched Merge Labs are among a handful of companies at the forefront of this fast-moving field. To most people, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) sound like science fiction. But this technology is getting real, quickly. BCI is nearing an inflection point in terms of real-world functionality, though most people haven’t yet realized it. Before long, these products will be ready for mainstream use and will begin to spread through society. Far-fetched though it may sound, capabilities like telepathy will soon be possible. One reason why BCI matters so much is that it will play a central role in defining how human intelligence and artificial intelligence fit together in a world with powerful AI. Now is the time to start paying serious attention to this field. Brain-computer interfaces are technologies that enable humans to interact directly with digital devices and the outside world using their minds. BCI is not one product or one technology. It is an entire discipline, encompassing various technical approaches, sensor types, capabilities and use cases. It includes both technologies that can interpret what is happening in the brain (i.e., ”read from” the brain) and technologies that can change what is happening in the brain (i.e., “write to” the brain). Products that enable you to control your computer using only your thoughts; products that send personalized electrical pulses to your brain to make you focus better or sleep better; products that can instantly translate your thoughts into written text; products that can enable blind people to see; products that can treat conditions like depression or OCD or PTSD by directly modifying your brain’s activity—these are all examples of BCI products under development today. BCI is not a new field. The first successful demonstration of a brain-computer interface in a human came in 1973, when participants in a UCLA study directly controlled a cursor on a computer screen with their minds based on EEG signals. Today, when most people think of brain-computer interfaces, they think of Neuralink, the BCI company launched by Elon Musk in 2016. Though it was not the first and is not the only BCI startup, Neuralink has played a central role in advancing this field in recent years. A fundamental divide lies at the heart of the field of BCI: invasive methods versus non-invasive methods. In order to understand this technology and its future, it is essential to understand this divide. Invasive approaches to BCI entail putting electronics inside the skull, directly in or on the brain. They require surgery. Most frequently the surgery is a craniotonomy, which involves cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain. Neuralink is the most well-known example of an invasive BCI company. (The term “implantable” is sometimes used as a more neutral alternative to “invasive.”) Non-invasive approaches, on the other hand, do not require a medical procedure. They rely on sensors that sit outside the skull (say, on a headband or a hat) to collect and interpret signals from the brain. The divide between invasive and non-invasive methods boils down to a tradeoff between accessibility (how easy the technology is for people to use) and signal quality (how detailed and accurate the information exchanged between brain and computer can be). Cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain is a high-risk, high-cost undertaking. It represents a major barrier to the technology’s widespread adoption. But conventional wisdom has long held that invasive methods are the only path to building the most sophisticated brain-computer interfaces, because non-invasive approaches simply cannot provide sufficiently high-fidelity information about brain activity. In recent years, innovations in hardware and in AI have begun to challenge this conventional wisdom. Higher-performing sensors are unlocking richer brain data non-invasively. More importantly, powerful new AI technologies are making it possible to extract greater signal from this data. If non-invasive methods can approach parity in performance with invasive methods, there is little doubt that they will win out, given how much easier they are to adopt. But that remains a huge “if.” No one can say with certainty where the performance ceiling will be for non-invasive methods. Many billions of dollars have been invested into both invasive and non-invasive BCI approaches in recent years. Much is at stake as this technology race unfolds over the coming years. Whether invasive or non-invasive, how exactly do brain-computer interfaces work? How is it possible for a digital computer to directly read from and write to a human brain? A quick exploration of how the brain works will sharpen our understanding of BCI technology. Like the rest of your body, your brain is made up of cells—in particular, a special kind of cell called a neuron. The human brain consists of roughly 86 billion neurons. These neurons connect to one another in complex and intertwining ways, with any given neuron connecting to as many as tens of thousands of other neurons. (Hence the term “neural network.”) In total, there are over 100 trillion connections between neurons in the human brain. Information flows through the neurons in your brain via electricity—the same force that powers kitchen appliances and lightbulbs and iPhones. This basic fact is the foundation of BCI technology. Whenever your brain does something—for instance, when you think a thought, or speak a sentence, or move your arm, or recognize a face—your neurons are sending electrical signals to one another, at massive scale, in particular patterns. At the most basic level, the information that a neuron communicates is binary: either it fires (i.e., propagates an electrical charge to its neighboring neuron) or it does not. This represents an important parallel between human brains and digital computers, which also encode information in binary form (i.e., 0 or 1). The electrical signal that comes from a single neuron firing is tiny: about a billionth of an amp and a tenth of a volt. But it is a concrete, detectable physical event in the world. And it triggers other detectable physical events in the world. For instance, because electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same underlying phenomenon—electromagnetism—when a neuron fires and generates a tiny electrical signal, it also generates a tiny magnetic field. Blood flow also increases to neurons when they fire, another physiological change whose patterns can be measured and analyzed. It is these physical events that BCI sensors detect and interpret in order to decode what is happening inside the brain. A range of different BCI sensor technologies have been developed that tackle this challenge in different ways. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Invasive BCI systems generally use sensors called electrodes—simple devices that sense electrical activity—to detect when neurons fire. Invasive systems are in direct contact with neurons, after all, so they have little need to rely on indirect indicators of neural activity. Non-invasive BCI, too, often uses sensors based on electricity, most commonly the electroencephalogram (EEG), the world’s oldest and most widely used brain sensor. But a number of other non-invasive sensor modalities have been developed more recently. These include magnetoencephalography (MEG), which detects changes in the brain’s magnetic fields, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which uses light beams to detect changes in blood flow in the brain. The best way to understand the state of the art in BCI technology today is to explore what today’s leading BCI startups are doing. Let’s start on the invasive side. In order to understand today’s invasive BCI startup landscape, the best place to start is with a brief history lesson. The first BCI technology to be implanted into a human’s brain was the “Utah array,” developed at the University of Utah in the 1980s and implanted into humans in clinical trials starting in the 1990s. The Utah array consists of a bed of 100 rigid needles measuring about one millimeter in length, each of which has an electrode at its tip. It looks like this: Implanting the Utah array entails cutting open the patient’s skull via a surgery called a crainiotomy and pushing the device into the patient’s brain. The Utah array was an important breakthrough in the development of brain-computer interfaces. It was the first technology to enable a human to control external devices like a computer or a robotic arm purely by thought. For a long time, it represented the gold standard in invasive BCI research. However, the Utah array also faces serious limitations that have precluded it from having widespread real-world clinical utility. Because it entails sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, it can activate a strong immune response, lead to scarring and inflammation, and disrupt the brain’s microbiome. The best way to understand the Utah array’s shortcomings is through an important concept in BCI technology known (vividly) as the “butcher ratio”: the ratio of the number of neurons that a BCI technology kills relative to the number of neurons that it can record from. The Utah array has a terrible butcher ratio. For every one neuron that it can stably record from, it kills hundreds or thousands of neurons (because its needles pierce through them). The first invasive BCI startups were based on the Utah array. This included Blackrock Neurotech (founded in 2008 as a spinout of the original University of Utah research) and Paradromics (founded in 2015). Despite years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, these companies have not had success in advancing their technologies into clinical trials, due largely to the shortcomings of the Utah array form factor. Last year, Tether (yes, the crypto company) acquired majority control of Blackrock Neurotech for $200 million. Another early competitor is worth mentioning—Synchron, founded in 2012 in Australia. Synchron has taken a different and quite clever approach to getting electronics into the human brain. Rather than cutting open the skull, Synchron has developed a BCI device that is inserted into a patient’s blood vessel. The device is then guided via the blood vessels to the brain, where it comes to rest in one of the major veins directly adjacent to the brain. This surgical procedure is simpler than a crainiotomy. It is very similar to the procedure used to implant coronary stents, which for decades has been one of the most common procedures in all of medicine. And it avoids sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, meaning its butcher ratio is zero. As a result, Synchron has made meaningful progress on the regulatory front. It was one of the first invasive BCI companies to receive FDA clearance to begin clinical trials. Its devices have been successfully implanted for years now in several patients with no serious adverse health effects. Synchron has raised over $100 million from leading venture capital firms including Khosla Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners. Earlier this year, the company announced high-profile partnerships with Nvidia and with Apple. But the same thing that makes Synchron’s approach safer and simpler may make it fundamentally limited. Because Synchron’s device does not directly interface with the brain’s neurons but rather sits inside a blood vessel next to the brain, the signals that it collects from the brain are less granular than other invasive methods. Synchron’s device is also meaningfully lower bandwidth than its competitors: it has only 16 electrodes (compared to, for example, Neuralink’s 1,024). And Synchron’s device can only “read from,” not “write to,” the brain. To date, the primary capability that patients with Synchron’s device have demonstrated is the ability to complete a simple click on a computer with their thoughts. While this can be a useful capability for a paralyzed patient, it is a far cry from more sophisticated BCI tasks like decoding thought into language. Synchron has plans to expand its BCI platform beyond a single 16-electrode device in a blood vessel. It remains to be seen whether the company can execute on this roadmap. This brings us to the most famous BCI company of all: Neuralink, founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, the world’s most successful (and polarizing) entrepreneur. Neuralink has aimed to fundamentally improve upon earlier BCI efforts. The company’s most important innovation compared to the BCI companies that came before has been to develop flexible threads, rather than rigid needles, to penetrate into the brain. These flexible threads are a marvel of modern engineering: each one is thinner than a human hair and contains 16 electrodes. They are less harmful than the Utah array’s needles, killing fewer neurons and causing less scarring. Other important innovations that Neuralink has pioneered include developing a neurosurgical robot to automate parts of the implantation surgery; making its BCI device fully wireless and battery-powered; and increasing the total number of electrodes on its BCI (1,024 channels for Neuralink’s current array versus 96 channels for the original Utah array and 16 channels for Synchron’s device), which enables richer information exchange between computer and brain. Like Synchron, Neuralink has progressed to clinical trials, successfully implanting its devices in 12 human patients to date. Videos of Noland Arbaugh, the first patient to receive Neuralink’s BCI, playing computer chess with his mind went viral last year, educating and inspiring the world about the potential of BCI. As with most Elon Musk companies, Neuralink has had no problem fundraising: the company has raised over $1 billion to date, most recently at a $9.7 billion valuation earlier this year. Yet ultimately, Neuralink’s approach remains within the decades-old Utah array paradigm: it involves sticking foreign objects into the patient’s brain tissue, killing some neurons in order to record from other neurons. To be clear, in many cases, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff to kill some neurons in order to unlock valuable functionality for the patient: say, enabling a paralyzed person to communicate with the outside world. The human brain entails plenty of redundancy, so it is possible to kill some neurons and still leave the patient’s brain functional. But this approach does not scale well. As more arrays are inserted into a patient’s brain in order to increase brain coverage, the number of neurons killed inevitably scales in tandem. If the goal is to scale BCI to whole-brain coverage in order to enable diverse and wide-ranging capabilities, this is a serious shortcoming of penetrating electrodes. Each Neuralink array is small, covering less than 0.1% of the brain’s total surface area. Many Neuralink arrays would therefore need to be implanted in order to cover a meaningful portion of the brain. But the butcher ratio presents a real problem for scaling the number of Neuralink arrays. For now, only single Neuralink arrays have been implanted in humans. Soon after Noland Arbaugh’s implantation surgery, 85% of the flexible threads implanted into his brain retracted out of his brain. Neuralink was able to stabilize and recover performance for Arbaugh’s BCI by reading local field potentials from his brain’s surface. Aside from fueling skepticism about the durability of Neuralink’s flexible threads, this incident raised a more fundamental question: are penetrating electrodes actually necessary in the first place? In recent years, a new generation of invasive BCI companies has emerged to explore newer technology approaches. While these companies are pursuing different research and product directions, they are united by one core insight: penetrating electrodes are inherently flawed because of the butcher ratio and will never be able to scale to whole-brain devices. Two startups in particular are worth highlighting: Precision Neuroscience and Science Corporation, both founded in 2021 by departed Neuralink cofounders. Precision Neuroscience is led by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport. A few years after cofounding Neuralink with Elon Musk, Rapoport decided to leave the company because he concluded that penetrating electrodes were the wrong path forward for BCI. “For a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness,” Rapaport said in an interview last year. “In the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this notion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one needed to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes. But this method has one big drawback: it causes some amount of brain damage when they’re inserted to the brain. We realized it was possible to extract information-rich data from the brain without damaging the brain.” How does Precision’s approach work? Precision uses a BCI technology known as electrocorticography, or ECoG. Like other invasive BCI methods, it requires surgery to implant. It goes underneath the skull and makes direct contact with the brain. But rather than penetrating into the brain’s tissue, it sits directly on top of the brain. This means it does not kill neurons (butcher ratio of zero), cause scarring or trigger an immune response from the insertion of a foreign object into the brain. Precision’s current array contains 1,024 electrodes, the same number as Neuralink’s. Because of its safer, lower-risk approach, Precision has progressed rapidly in clinical trials. Its device has already been temporarily implanted in a few dozen patients. The company received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in 2023 and FDA 510(k) clearance earlier this year. The safety advantages of a BCI device that stays on the brain’s surface rather than penetrating into its tissue are easy to understand. But does it work as well as penetrating electrodes do? If ECoG avoided brain damage but could not deliver advanced BCI capabilities on par with penetrating electrodes, then it would not be a particularly compelling solution. Years of clinical research, in particular from Dr. Edward Chang’s lab at UCSF, indicate that ECoG-based BCI can in fact enable the most sophisticated BCI use cases without needing to penetrate into brain tissue. In 2021, Dr. Chang’s UCSF lab was the first in the world to show that an invasive BCI system could accurately turn a person’s thoughts into written words. In a followup study in 2023, the same UCSF research team went further, showing that its system could decode a paralyzed patient’s thoughts into words, speech and facial expressions at the same time, with an average speed of 78 words per minute. Earlier this year, moving beyond language, UCSF researchers showed that an ECoG system could enable a paralyzed patient to control a robotic arm and hand with their thoughts. All of these research breakthroughs were achieved using non-penetrating ECoG devices. These capabilities do not just match but in fact surpass anything that Neuralink or any other company has yet demonstrated publicly with penetrating electrodes. Neuralink’s focus to this point has been to enable patients to control a computer cursor with their thoughts. While computer control is an important and useful ability, it is significantly lower-dimensional and less complex of a feat than accurately decoding language. Precision expects to receive FDA approval and begin commercializing its BCI product by 2028 or 2029. The final invasive BCI startup that we will discuss, Science Corporation, is the most ambitious and mind-bending of them all. Science was founded in 2021 by Max Hodak, the polymathic cofounder and former president of Neuralink. The company has raised close to $300 million to date from investors including Khosla Ventures. Science is pursuing two main product lines. The first is an implant that goes into the retina and can restore sight to certain types of blind patients. Last year, Science completed a successful clinical trial for this technology in which blind patients regained the ability to, for instance, read books and complete crossword puzzles. The company is aiming to receive final regulatory approval and begin commercializing this product as soon as next year in Europe, with the U.S. following thereafter. Restoring sight to the blind is ambitious enough—it is literally biblical. But Science’s second product seeks to push the frontiers of brain science far further. The company is developing a biohybrid neural interface. All the other brain-computer interface technologies that we have discussed in this article are made of traditional materials like metal and plastic. Science’s biohybrid BCI, on the other hand, combines engineered hardware with living cells. How does it work? The company grows living biological neurons (originally derived from stem cells) in a lab. They embed those biological neurons into an electronic device and then implant the combined biological/electronic system on a patient’s brain. Once implanted, the engineered neurons gradually grow into and form connections with the patient’s own neurons, essentially becoming an extension of the patient’s brain. This approach eliminates the need to harmfully jab metal or plastic into a patient’s brain in order to bring electrodes and neurons next to one another. Instead, the patient’s own neurons grow toward and form natural connections with the bioengineered neurons, which themselves are already connected to electrodes. Biohybrid BCIs ingeniously leverage biology, harnessing biological neurons’ natural ability to safely integrate with brain tissue and to efficiently transmit information. No entity in the known universe, after all, is better suited to interface with the brain’s neurons than…other biological neurons. Consider how much higher-bandwidth a biohybrid BCI could be than a conventional BCI. Since neurons form many connections with one another, if a biohybrid BCI contained one million engineered neurons (which would fit in less than one cubic millimeter—quite feasible from a space perspective), that could produce one billion connections between the patient’s brain and the BCI. Compare that to the 1,024 electrodes of today’s Neuralink or Precision devices. It is important to note that this technology is still in the early stages of development. It is not yet clear that it will work in humans. Many thorny scientific and engineering challenges remain to be solved. Many years of research and development lie ahead. But, if they work, biohybrid BCIs could prove to be the safest, highest-performing and most elegant invasive BCI technology of all—the ultimate way to meld the human brain and digital technology. Stay tuned for the second part of this two-part article series, coming out in a few weeks, which will dive into non-invasive BCI technology and startups. Before we conclude, let’s zoom out and ask a basic question: how big of a deal is brain-computer interface technology? BCI is fascinating and futuristic technology, no doubt. But, relative to other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence or nuclear energy, how much will it ultimately matter to the world? How big of an impact will it have on humanity? The short answer: BCI will have an enormous and transformative impact on humanity. The nearest-term applications of BCI will be medical, so let’s start there. Tens of millions of people around the world today are paralyzed due to stroke, spinal cord injuries, ALS and other causes. Brain-computer interfaces could give these people their lives back, enabling them to communicate with others, move physical objects, and engage with the outside world in ways that previously would have been impossible. Beyond giving the gifts of speech and movement to the paralyzed, novel forms of BCI that can precisely modulate patients’ brain activity may offer powerful solutions for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions: depression, alcoholism, OCD, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, epilepsy, Parkinson’s and more. This is not just a hypothetical possibility: recent peer-reviewed research has clearly demonstrated the potential of these next-generation, AI-based neuromodulatory approaches. The price per patient for an invasive BCI implant is expected to be on the order of $150,000 (with insurance providers expected to play a key role in covering it). This means that, in addition to its tremendous positive human impact, medical BCI represents an enormous market opportunity—up to hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States alone. But medical applications of invasive BCI are just the beginning. The technology’s most far-reaching and profound impacts will come as BCI is adopted across the broader population. Consider the following possibilities, all of which should in principle be feasible: People will be able to communicate via direct brain-to-brain telepathy, bypassing the need for language altogether. Language is, after all, a lossy and imprecise way to compress and transmit one’s higher-dimensional inner thoughts and experiences to other people. It will become possible to directly convey states of mind without using words—to transmit ideas, feelings and memories to one another instantaneously. Natural language is one of humanity’s most important inventions. It is the bedrock of human civilization. BCI could eventually render it obsolete. Going beyond one-on-one communication to group interaction, BCI technology will unlock radical new forms of collective intelligence: groups of human scientists, engineers or entrepreneurs could literally “mind meld” to tackle complex problems or produce new creations in ways that individuals never could. Humans will integrate more closely with AI than ever before. Your thoughts will be continuously augmented by an artificial intelligence connected directly to your mind. Think a question and an answer will surface in your awareness; brainstorm on a topic and you will have an infinitely knowledgeable thought partner brainstorming with you in real-time. AI systems will become a natural extension and multiplier of your own cognitive processes. Ultimately, no clear dividing line will exist between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Imagine being able to instantly gain new skills—say, karate or scuba diving or golf—merely by “uploading” them to your brain, directly reinforcing the appropriate neural pathways. Or, imagine being able to recall and relive any memory with perfect “sensory fidelity.” Imagine, too, how entertainment and art will change. Totally immersive experiences that engage all five senses with complete fidelity will be possible, far more powerful and authentic than anything virtual reality could achieve. It will be possible to experience, in the truest sense of that word, what it feels like to visit the Taj Mahal or to be a pharaoh in ancient Egypt. Artists will be able to transmit particular emotions and states of mind to their audiences instead of creating works of art that merely hint at them. BCI should also make it possible to reprogram your brain to see or feel things that today’s human brains cannot directly sense: Wi-Fi signals, or radio waves, or the direction “true north.” Along similar lines, synesthesia (the intermingling of different senses) on demand will become possible: imagine seeing music as colors, or hearing a painting, or tasting a mathematical formula. The future will be weird and wonderful. Keep an eye out for our followup article on this topic, focused on non-invasive BCI technologies and startups, which will be published in a few weeks.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 1:36:33 PM PDT by marcusmaximus US senators Charles Grassley and Richard Durbin have raised concerns about major corporations, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Cognizant, for filing thousands of H-1B skilled worker visa petitions even as they conducted large-scale layoffs of American employees. Other companies questioned include Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart. The inquiry comes amid high unemployment in the US tech sector, which exceeds the overall national jobless rate. Recent American graduates with STEM degrees are reportedly struggling to find jobs, prompting the senators to question why companies are replacing US workers with foreign visa holders, as per PTI reports. Allegations Against TCS And Cognizant TCS announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including Americans, while applying to hire 5,505 foreign H-1B workers in 2025. The company is also under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly replacing older American staff with H-1B visa holders. Cognizant similarly laid off thousands of workers and applied for 2,493 H-1B employees. A 2024 federal jury found Cognizant favored South Asian H-1B workers over American staff, resulting in punitive damages. Other Tech Companies Under Scrutiny Amazon laid off tens of thousands of employees while applying for 10,044 H-1B visas. Google cut large numbers of employees, including managers, and applied for 4,181 foreign hires. Meta laid off 3,600 employees while applying for 5,123 H-1B workers. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees but applied for 5,189 H-1B visas despite reporting record profits. (Excerpt) Read more at timesnownews.com ...

Hopefully something is done about the Indian invasion before it’s too late. We should just end the their h1b visa scam anyways Well i can tell you! Here at ncfast/ncdhhs we hired 100s of them. Wound out 1 guy was practically taking the technical interviews for all of them! After a long long while managers had to admit they hired h1bs that didn’t know crap and couldn’t code in curam environment. Lovely granular detail in the article. Amazon is number one! As tallied by the WSJ, Amazon is number one by Amazon is "14.667" while Tata Consultancy Services comes to "5,586." Amazon is the winner, and still reigning champion!

This may be very naive, but why do we have an H1-B visa program? If Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and the other large companies feel they have to hire the “best” engineers and computer scientists who all come from Inida, why don’t they hire them in India? There is no need to bring them to the US. They can work from India. Good point.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/05/2025 11:16:50 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Sudden layoffs from jobs are tough to process and it gets worse when questions of employees remain unanswered. In one such case, an Indian employee detailed his sudden layoff from a US-based company in a Reddit post which has gone viral. According to the post, the employee was caught off guard by the termination, which took place on October 1, over a three-minute video call. “It was literally like any other day, woke up at 8:30, logged into work at 9 and saw a calendar invite for 11. It was a mandatory meeting with our COO for all India employees. I joined it at 11, he joined at 11:01, disabled everyone’s cameras and mics, casually let us know that they had “made the difficult decision of letting most of their Indian work force go”,’ the post read. The employee clarified that the layoffs were not performance-based but part of an internal organisational restructuring. ‘No time to prepare’ Sharing the emotional impact of the layoff, the Reddit post further stated that the three-minute video call left Indian employees “shocked, stunned, frustrated, stressed”. “No prior intimation, no time to prepare. They have offered October’s salary to paid at the end of the month and any leaves would be encashed. None of it even remotely makes up for what I’m feeling right now. This is the first time I’ve been laid off and it just truly…sucks,” read the post. (Excerpt) Read more at financialexpress.com ...

Is Wall Street’s golden ratio, the 60/40 division of portfolios between stocks and bonds, losing its luster? Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com The origin of the 60/40 strategy lies in the research of American economist Harry Markowitz, a longtime professor of finance at the University of California, San Diego, who died in 2023. He was renowned for his 1950s work on modern portfolio theory, which argued investors should blend a mix of high-risk, high-return assets with low-risk, low-return assets. For his work on reducing investor exposure to risk through diversification, which was acclaimed for its “algebraic simplicity,” he won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics. By the early 1990s, the 60/40 portfolio had become a go-to interpretation of modern portfolio theory, and Markowitz’s work was widely embraced by individual and institutional investors alike. The idea is simple: Divide your asset portfolio into 60% equities and 40% fixed-income securities like government bonds, gaining exposure to the high returns of stock market booms while at the same time keeping a foothold in more stable bonds, whose lower but reliable returns can protect your wealth from bear markets. Distant and recent history make a direct case for the 60/40 approach. By measuring past market declines and the amount of time it took to recover from them, Morningstar calculated that the Great Depression was four times more painful for the stock market than it was for a 60/40 portfolio. The Lost Decade of the 2000s, which kicked off with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and ended with the Great Recession, was over seven times as painful for equities. In other words, even as the 60/40 portfolio has posted less overall growth than the stock market over the course of decades, it has proven more resilient in times of crisis, making it particularly attractive for individual retirement portfolios or pensions designed for stability. However, 2022 changed the arithmetic. Equities and bonds experienced a simultaneous decline amid two crises: Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine reorganized much of the global economy and energy markets along geopolitical lines, and a supply-chain crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global commerce. Both contributed to spiking inflation that has yet to fully subside. The stock market regained its 2022 high well over a year ago, in September 2024. But the bond market has been a totally different story: It remains underwater. That’s because of the Federal Reserve’s sustained and aggressive interest-rate hikes, which began in March 2022 and have been pared only marginally in the past year. Bond yields in 2022 were near the lowest in history, which means prices were high because of their inverse relationship with yields. The run of rate hikes, which boosted interest rates from nearly zero to over 4%, caused yields to spike and bond prices to crater. The bond market’s sustained pain has been so severe, Morningstar noted, that the typical 60/40 portfolio didn’t recover to its 2022 high until June 2025, roughly eight months after equities did so. That marked the only time in a century and a half that the 60/40 portfolio suffered more pain during a downturn than equities. The chief criticism of the 60/40 portfolio used to be that it offered less exposure to the greater potential upside of equities. Of course, that’s sort of the point, as it’s also meant to blunt their higher risk profile. But now, increasing attention is being paid to the risk that the economy remains in a state of relatively high inflation with relatively high interest rates. That would maintain pressure on bonds and, naturally, the 60/40 portfolio, prompting suggestions that it’s time for adjustments. Last month, Morgan Stanley Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson argued for a new portfolio approach that allocates 60% to equities, 20% to fixed income and 20% to gold. “Gold is now the anti-fragile asset to own, rather than Treasurys,” he told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “High-quality equities and gold are the best hedges.” Spot gold prices have surged 49% this year to record highs of over $3,800 per ounce, and Wall Street expects them to continue rising into next year. Wilson’s argument hinges on the idea that equities are linked to growth and risk tolerance, while gold is a safe-haven asset that traditionally rallies in times of uncertainty and when rates fall. Last year, Morgan Stanley also suggested that investors consider weighting equities more heavily in their portfolios for a potentially “better risk/reward balance” if generative AI, which has powered the stock market’s rally, continues to thrive and bond markets remain subdued. Last week, JPMorgan’s private bank arm, which serves high-net-worth individuals, recommended a 60/30/10 portfolio that includes a 10% stake in hedge funds. This mix, the bank said, has outperformed the 60/40 portfolio 70% of the time in the past decade and every year since 2021. JPMorgan pros also suggested considering investments in private markets, such as private equity, since companies are taking longer to go public than in previous decades, which has reduced the amount of post-IPO value that investors can capture in public markets. “The median tech IPO is now ~14 years old with ~$220 million in sales compared to ~7 years, and below $20 million in the late 1990s,” the bank’s analysts wrote. “In fact, today’s top private companies (SpaceX, ByteDance, OpenAI) would already rank among the top 30 S&P 500 companies by market cap if they were public.” That could affect not only institutional investors and pension funds that practice 60/40, but also retail investors, since investment firms have taken steps (some controversially) to increase their access to private markets. One final consideration that disrupts the 60/40 strategy, according to Edelman Financial Services cofounder Ric Edelman, is life itself. Or, more accurately, lifespan itself. “We are living longer than ever before as a species; nowhere in human history have humans lived this long,” he told CNBC in May, noting the previously unthinkable ranks of octogenarians and nonagenarians alive today thanks to improvements in healthcare and living conditions. The 60/40 portfolio, he said, is “dead because of longevity” and argued a 70% to 80% allocation to equities is a more reasonable ratio for those who want their savings to carry them into old age. “If you die at 80, it’s not a problem, but if you live to 90 or 100, or 110, it’s an issue,” he added. Fitting for 2025, a government shutdown is all but guaranteed to deliver even more uncertainty into the macroeconomic mix. A US regulator last week cleared the path for more retail investors to participate in day trading by dropping barriers put up in 2001. In a speech in Rhode Island, Jerome Powell reminded Wall Street and the world that The Fed remains in a “challenging situation.” Lachlan Murdoch’s moves so far are clearly those of someone who came of age during an era of rapidly advancing digitization. American Express justifies the hike with more than $3,500 in benefits, including credits that go towards dining, flights, and entertainment. The hope for the S&P 500’s small-cap cousin after the Fed’s rate cut tells an important story about the broader economy. President Trump wants to end mandated quarterly financial reports for publicly traded companies. Odds are his dream comes true. Demand for copper, already one of the most commonly used metals in the world, has surged amid the AI computing boom. The return-to-office orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety. Morgan Stanley analysts think the US economy has been in a “rolling recession” since 2022 — and it may already be almost over. Investor appetite for StubHub and Klarna is especially compelling at a time when consumer sentiment starting to slump. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Tom Dunne has recalled the "torturous path" to starting a family, saying there were times when he "wondered was this ever going to happen". The musician-turned-radio broadcaster appears in the latest episode of the new series of Keys To My Life, the RTÉ show in which presenter Brendan Courtney meets Irish personalities who reveal how the places they've lived in have shaped their lives. In an emotional and wide-ranging episode, Dunne recalls his years fronting the acclaimed Irish band Something Happens, known for their hit singles Parachute and Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello (Petrol). Despite the band calling it quits after they were dropped from their label Virgin Records following the release of their third album, Dunne said he has only fond memories of that time. "I never take away from what we did," he said. "Being in Something Happens was the thing I felt most alive doing. It was a great experience." The mid-90s marked a decline in the band's fortunes, but 1996 proved to be a golden year for Dunne when he met his future wife, Audrey. Three years later, they moved to Blackrock and in 2002 they got married in The Plaza Hotel in New York. However, one piece of life's puzzle was still eluding the couple. Becoming emotional about their attempts to start a family together, Dunne said: "There was a torturous path to that, IVF, and there was times when you really wondered was this ever going to happen." Dunne, who shares daughters Eva and Sky with his wife, continued: "We were just getting knocked back a lot, it seemed. "It goes so easy for so many people and is so difficult for so many other people. When we became pregnant that was the greatest day ever. We stuck at it and got our reward, two very special young ladies." In 2017, Dunne received a shocking health diagnosis with the discovery of a malformed heart valve that could end his life at any moment. He recalled: "I got a phone call to go in and see the surgeon. He said I had a 70% chance of dying within the next two years. It just stops opening and then you're dead, there's no warning about it." Dunne said he had surgery to replace the damaged valve with a pig valve. "It's like a miracle," he said. "I love my life, I really do. I didn't want to change things afterwards, I just wanted to have more of it. I love music, I love my family, I love everything." When asked by Courtney if he had any big takeout from that time in his life, he said: "I certainly enjoy every moment. "I think the most searing thing was holding Sky's hand, at the time she was about eight, and she's just a beautiful girl. And I just thought, 'This is so precious'. "Life is full of those precious little moments, you're holding somebody's hand. Worth their weight in gold." Keys To My Life airs on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player at 8:30pm on Sunday, 5 October.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. UPDATE, October 6, 2025: This article was originally published on October 4, 2025. It has been updated after AMD announced it had entered into a multi-year deal to provide chips to OpenAI. Lisa Su is the engineer behind one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds in the tech industry. The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia. On Monday, the company announced that it had agreed to a massive multi-year deal to provide its AI chips to OpenAI. The announcement sent AMD's stock soaring as much as 27% in premarket trading. When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025. But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing. Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation: Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City. As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986. Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s. Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies. After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor. As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research. Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion. At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming. AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market. In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD. In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel. In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles. The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips. In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60. By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion. Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event. "I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility. In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building. Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology. Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together. Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends. Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title. Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother. Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers. AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia. When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because "the market is humongous" and she sees plenty of opportunities. On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware. In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential. But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out. "Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem." Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips. In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market. "We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. "They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation." In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses. On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead." The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations. On Monday, AMD announced it had agreed to a multi-billion-dollar partnership to supply its artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI. The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia. The multi-year deal, announced Monday, will see OpenAI deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first 1 gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026. It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets. "This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said. Jump to

Title: More CEOs want Elon Musk–style ‘moonshot’ pay packages—but comp experts are raising alarms

Time Published: 2025-10-05T10:04:00Z
Full Content:
Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. The all-or-nothing moonshot pay plan was a gambit so risky even Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s wife was against it. But Smith had started getting antsy around 2016, as he was approaching three decades at the company, Axon compensation committee chair Hadi Partovi told Fortune. Smith was talking more seriously to the board about his succession plan, who was next to lead the company, and what he would do next. Partovi knew Smith could make a lot more money if he launched a startup than if he made Axon worth 10 times as much under his previous comp plan. “This is when I realized we had a real problem,” said Partovi. Smith thrives in high-risk, high-reward environments, so the Axon board granted Smith a near carbon copy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s moonshot pay plan but on a much smaller scale. The challenge to Smith was to grow the Taser stun gun and body-camera maker 10-fold over a 10-year performance period starting in 2018. From a base of $2.5 billion, Smith had to increase the company’s market cap by $1 billion to unlock each new tranche of stock options, for a total of 12 tranches and a market cap of $13.5 billion. In addition, Smith had to hit eight revenue-based operational or eight adjusted-Ebitda-based goals. During the decade he was supposed to work on achieving those goals, he would get almost nothing—no bonuses or other incentives, and his salary was about $31,000 a year. “In full candor, my wife was against me taking on the challenge, as she saw it as just too risky,” Smith wrote in a letter to investors in 2023. But Smith blew through all the goals and each of the 12 tranches in five years—half the time the board gave him—making Smith the highest-paid CEO last year with compensation valued at $165 million. The stock price grew more than 600% between 2018 when the board offered him the moonshot and 2023. After he unlocked the 12th tranche, Smith negotiated an $88 million reduction on his next performance plan (which will keep him at Axon until at least 2030 with a goal of driving the stock to $943.75) and directed it be granted to the lowest-paid workers at Axon, showering them with surprise stock grants based on their years of tenure at the company. “The best is yet to come,” Smith wrote to investors in his letter this year. Smith shooting the moon—twice, potentially—represents a resurgent breed of executive compensation that has captured the imaginations of a growing number of CEOs. Moonshot wanderlust initially kicked into high gear after Elon Musk’s groundbreaking 2017 award from Tesla, once valued as high as $56 billion before it was twice rescinded owing to a legal challenge. Moonshot grants, not to be confused with an outsize stock grant known as a “mega grant” for its sheer size, tie CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible performance targets, explained Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at comp consulting firm Farient Advisors. CEOs don’t get the awards unless they hit specific valuation hurdles and operational goals, he said, and the performance periods are typically five, seven or 10 years, rather than the more standard three-year period. “It should be difficult to get these awards,” said Hoffmann. “You have to create a lot of value in order to earn these kinds of awards.” Traditional CEO pay packages include a base salary, an annual cash bonus, and a longer-term equity incentive award often based on time and performance goals. According to compensation data firm Equilar, median compensation among S&P 500 CEOs was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% over the year prior. Moonshot awards, however, upend the traditional compensation model while also bucking the trend of billionaire tech founders like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who all held large equity stakes and focused on making them more valuable, noted Hoffmann. The key distinction is that those founders built wealth by focusing on increasing the value of their existing equity stakes, while taking minimal or no compensation, rather than seeking massive equity grants on top of their founder stakes, said Hoffmann. The moonshot model is a departure—seeking both founder equity upside plus additional compensation awards. “This way of wealth building is different than what was used during the dotcom era,” he noted. The upside to the moonshot is an enormous payout and a growing slice of company ownership if an executive can deliver transformational growth, but investors aren’t always wild about them, and moonshots don’t come without significant risk, said Todd Sirras, a managing director with consulting firm Semler Brossy who has advised clients on these deals. Companies are “willing to bet all of these ungodly amounts of money on one person thinking, ‘That’s the right machine we need for the factory,’” said Sirras. But there’s a fundamental flaw in this approach because people are unpredictable—unlike factory equipment. “Human beings are terrible machines,” Sirras told Fortune. “They’re emotional. Their attention gets divided thinking about what airplane they’re going to buy. It’s more risky to invest in a human being than it is to invest in a machine because human beings break in different and unpredictable ways.” Until now, the moonshot offers have been almost exclusive to founder-CEOs and almost always established pre-IPO, said Sirras. Semler Brossy’s database of about 80 moonshot awards includes dozens issued during the SPAC IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 that are now “dead in the water” because companies failed to meet their valuation targets, he added. With fewer IPOs in recent years and fewer moonshots, there are about 16 that exist among large publicly traded companies—and even fewer CEOs who have achieved maximum payouts, including Smith and Musk, according to research from Claire Kamas, a senior data analyst at Farient Advisors. Other companies that have awarded the grants include Airbnb, DoorDash, Oracle, ServiceNow, and RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, Kamas found. But the high-profile nature of the awards and the eye-popping figures associated with them are pushing board-level compensation committees that negotiate CEO pay to prepare for conversations about similar packages. Farient has gotten queries from compensation committee chairs who are already preparing for how they will address the situation when the CEO comes to them about a moonshot plan. In one case, the CEO isn’t a founder but a manager hired to run the company, Hoffmann noted. He isn’t a fan of moonshot awards, particularly in cases where CEOs already hold significant ownership stakes and control over their companies. “From a firm perspective, it is our view that these plans are generally not in the best interests of the organizations, the stakeholders, and shareholders in these companies,” said Hoffmann. “To me, a lot of these feel like a lottery ticket, a winner-take-all.” Despite the risk, Sirras sees these awards rising in popularity again, and he sees new trends emerging: Founders are granting moonshots to their “anointed successors,” he said. Real estate platform Opendoor Technologies this month granted a moonshot potentially worth $2.8 billion and an 11% slice of the company to new CEO Kaz Nejatian. Sirras said that award looks to be the first of its kind, and the board likely offered it to Nejatian because of a blessing from Opendoor’s cofounders, Eric Wu and Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois. Wu and Rabois returned to the board alongside Nejatian’s hiring and invested $40 million of equity capital into the company. Sirras said the same trend seems to be occurring in private equity. For instance, when founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts of KKR stepped down, the firm in 2021 granted co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall 1.2 million shares of KKR Holdings, valued at about $75 million, as part of their promotions. That same year, Apollo Global Management granted copresidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman the potential to earn more than $860 million in stock. Zelter was promoted to president in 2025, and Marc Rowan remains CEO. In addition to controlling founders who are planning leadership transitions and “founder-anointed successors,” the new wave of awards will likely also go to leading-edge executives in scenarios in which founders are making investment decisions, said Sirras. The arms race for talent between OpenAI and Meta and the reported compensation packages Zuckerberg has offered come to mind, he added. “From a design perspective, the magnitude is mind-boggling,” said Sirras. He compared it to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras wrote in an email. Alongside moonshots for founder-anointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T. rex fence,” the rise of “awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland,” Sirras wrote. The awards can also prompt investors to revolt. Business payments company Corpay awarded CEO Ronald Clarke 850,000 performance-based stock options valued at $55.6 million in 2021. The award had stock price hurdles of $350 and $400 and Clarke got no long-term equity grants in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the comp committee canceled 300,000 stock options subject to the $400 hurdle and modified the criterion for 550,000 stock options subject to the $350 hurdle to require that Corpay hit a closing stock price at or above $350 for at least three trading days by the end of 2024. Clarke achieved the modified hurdle on Oct. 23, 2024. Corpay told investors the change was meant to “align Mr. Clarke’s realized pay with that of shareholders who benefited from the increased stock level over $350 before the modification, but prior to the modification the stock had not closed above $350 for 10 consecutive days, which was the pre-modification hurdle.” In other words, the board made it simpler for Clarke to earn the stock options by reducing the target from 10 consecutive trading days above $350 to just three trading days, a hurdle he cleared shortly after the change. The stock didn’t hit $400 until February 2025 and is currently trading at just under $300. The company’s 2025 Say-on-Pay vote—a thumbs-up, thumbs-down nonbinding vote on executive pay—only got support from 53.5% of votes cast. Over the past 14 years, the Russell 3000 index saw average support of about 91% for pay programs. Corpay did not respond to a request for comment. At Axon, Smith’s moonshot deal differs from Musk’s in another key way: It’s open to Smith’s direct reports on down to line workers at Axon, making employees eligible for a version of Smith’s moonshot deal. Workers could give up some salary, put some of their pay at risk, and work to hit revenue targets. Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee. The board also changed the vehicle type from performance options to restricted stock, added in speed brakes that would keep Smith at Axon, and made it more difficult for Smith to hit the last few tranches. Partovi said he addressed every question from shareholders about misalignment in the plan during the board’s negotiation process with Smith. Ultimately, Partovi credits the moonshot deal with transforming the corporate culture around shared risk and high reward with a version of a high-stakes compensation plan rolled out to everyone at the company. In his view, it helped to eliminate dynamics where direct reports and general employees resent outsize pay for the chief executive, he said. “The big thing is, the CEO is taking a risk in giving up his pay, and you don’t want it to turn out to be shareholders win and the CEO wins or shareholders lose and the CEO still wins,” said Partovi. “I don’t know if grants like Rick’s make sense for everybody, but they strongly make sense for Rick Smith at Axon.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: More CEOs want Elon Musk–style ‘moonshot’ pay packages—but comp experts are raising alarms

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. The all-or-nothing moonshot pay plan was a gambit so risky even Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s wife was against it. But Smith had started getting antsy around 2016, as he was approaching three decades at the company, Axon compensation committee chair Hadi Partovi told Fortune. Smith was talking more seriously to the board about his succession plan, who was next to lead the company, and what he would do next. Partovi knew Smith could make a lot more money if he launched a startup than if he made Axon worth 10 times as much under his previous comp plan. “This is when I realized we had a real problem,” said Partovi. Smith thrives in high-risk, high-reward environments, so the Axon board granted Smith a near carbon copy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s moonshot pay plan but on a much smaller scale. The challenge to Smith was to grow the Taser stun gun and body-camera maker 10-fold over a 10-year performance period starting in 2018. From a base of $2.5 billion, Smith had to increase the company’s market cap by $1 billion to unlock each new tranche of stock options, for a total of 12 tranches and a market cap of $13.5 billion. In addition, Smith had to hit eight revenue-based operational or eight adjusted-Ebitda-based goals. During the decade he was supposed to work on achieving those goals, he would get almost nothing—no bonuses or other incentives, and his salary was about $31,000 a year. “In full candor, my wife was against me taking on the challenge, as she saw it as just too risky,” Smith wrote in a letter to investors in 2023. But Smith blew through all the goals and each of the 12 tranches in five years—half the time the board gave him—making Smith the highest-paid CEO last year with compensation valued at $165 million. The stock price grew more than 600% between 2018 when the board offered him the moonshot and 2023. After he unlocked the 12th tranche, Smith negotiated an $88 million reduction on his next performance plan (which will keep him at Axon until at least 2030 with a goal of driving the stock to $943.75) and directed it be granted to the lowest-paid workers at Axon, showering them with surprise stock grants based on their years of tenure at the company. “The best is yet to come,” Smith wrote to investors in his letter this year. Smith shooting the moon—twice, potentially—represents a resurgent breed of executive compensation that has captured the imaginations of a growing number of CEOs. Moonshot wanderlust initially kicked into high gear after Elon Musk’s groundbreaking 2017 award from Tesla, once valued as high as $56 billion before it was twice rescinded owing to a legal challenge. Moonshot grants, not to be confused with an outsize stock grant known as a “mega grant” for its sheer size, tie CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible performance targets, explained Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at comp consulting firm Farient Advisors. CEOs don’t get the awards unless they hit specific valuation hurdles and operational goals, he said, and the performance periods are typically five, seven or 10 years, rather than the more standard three-year period. “It should be difficult to get these awards,” said Hoffmann. “You have to create a lot of value in order to earn these kinds of awards.” Traditional CEO pay packages include a base salary, an annual cash bonus, and a longer-term equity incentive award often based on time and performance goals. According to compensation data firm Equilar, median compensation among S&P 500 CEOs was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% over the year prior. Moonshot awards, however, upend the traditional compensation model while also bucking the trend of billionaire tech founders like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Larry Page, and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who all held large equity stakes and focused on making them more valuable, noted Hoffmann. The key distinction is that those founders built wealth by focusing on increasing the value of their existing equity stakes, while taking minimal or no compensation, rather than seeking massive equity grants on top of their founder stakes, said Hoffmann. The moonshot model is a departure—seeking both founder equity upside plus additional compensation awards. “This way of wealth building is different than what was used during the dotcom era,” he noted. The upside to the moonshot is an enormous payout and a growing slice of company ownership if an executive can deliver transformational growth, but investors aren’t always wild about them, and moonshots don’t come without significant risk, said Todd Sirras, a managing director with consulting firm Semler Brossy who has advised clients on these deals. Companies are “willing to bet all of these ungodly amounts of money on one person thinking, ‘That’s the right machine we need for the factory,’” said Sirras. But there’s a fundamental flaw in this approach because people are unpredictable—unlike factory equipment. “Human beings are terrible machines,” Sirras told Fortune. “They’re emotional. Their attention gets divided thinking about what airplane they’re going to buy. It’s more risky to invest in a human being than it is to invest in a machine because human beings break in different and unpredictable ways.” Until now, the moonshot offers have been almost exclusive to founder-CEOs and almost always established pre-IPO, said Sirras. Semler Brossy’s database of about 80 moonshot awards includes dozens issued during the SPAC IPO boom of 2020 and 2021 that are now “dead in the water” because companies failed to meet their valuation targets, he added. With fewer IPOs in recent years and fewer moonshots, there are about 16 that exist among large publicly traded companies—and even fewer CEOs who have achieved maximum payouts, including Smith and Musk, according to research from Claire Kamas, a senior data analyst at Farient Advisors. Other companies that have awarded the grants include Airbnb, DoorDash, Oracle, ServiceNow, and RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, Kamas found. But the high-profile nature of the awards and the eye-popping figures associated with them are pushing board-level compensation committees that negotiate CEO pay to prepare for conversations about similar packages. Farient has gotten queries from compensation committee chairs who are already preparing for how they will address the situation when the CEO comes to them about a moonshot plan. In one case, the CEO isn’t a founder but a manager hired to run the company, Hoffmann noted. He isn’t a fan of moonshot awards, particularly in cases where CEOs already hold significant ownership stakes and control over their companies. “From a firm perspective, it is our view that these plans are generally not in the best interests of the organizations, the stakeholders, and shareholders in these companies,” said Hoffmann. “To me, a lot of these feel like a lottery ticket, a winner-take-all.” Despite the risk, Sirras sees these awards rising in popularity again, and he sees new trends emerging: Founders are granting moonshots to their “anointed successors,” he said. Real estate platform Opendoor Technologies this month granted a moonshot potentially worth $2.8 billion and an 11% slice of the company to new CEO Kaz Nejatian. Sirras said that award looks to be the first of its kind, and the board likely offered it to Nejatian because of a blessing from Opendoor’s cofounders, Eric Wu and Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois. Wu and Rabois returned to the board alongside Nejatian’s hiring and invested $40 million of equity capital into the company. Sirras said the same trend seems to be occurring in private equity. For instance, when founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts of KKR stepped down, the firm in 2021 granted co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall 1.2 million shares of KKR Holdings, valued at about $75 million, as part of their promotions. That same year, Apollo Global Management granted copresidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman the potential to earn more than $860 million in stock. Zelter was promoted to president in 2025, and Marc Rowan remains CEO. In addition to controlling founders who are planning leadership transitions and “founder-anointed successors,” the new wave of awards will likely also go to leading-edge executives in scenarios in which founders are making investment decisions, said Sirras. The arms race for talent between OpenAI and Meta and the reported compensation packages Zuckerberg has offered come to mind, he added. “From a design perspective, the magnitude is mind-boggling,” said Sirras. He compared it to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras wrote in an email. Alongside moonshots for founder-anointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T. rex fence,” the rise of “awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland,” Sirras wrote. The awards can also prompt investors to revolt. Business payments company Corpay awarded CEO Ronald Clarke 850,000 performance-based stock options valued at $55.6 million in 2021. The award had stock price hurdles of $350 and $400 and Clarke got no long-term equity grants in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2024, the comp committee canceled 300,000 stock options subject to the $400 hurdle and modified the criterion for 550,000 stock options subject to the $350 hurdle to require that Corpay hit a closing stock price at or above $350 for at least three trading days by the end of 2024. Clarke achieved the modified hurdle on Oct. 23, 2024. Corpay told investors the change was meant to “align Mr. Clarke’s realized pay with that of shareholders who benefited from the increased stock level over $350 before the modification, but prior to the modification the stock had not closed above $350 for 10 consecutive days, which was the pre-modification hurdle.” In other words, the board made it simpler for Clarke to earn the stock options by reducing the target from 10 consecutive trading days above $350 to just three trading days, a hurdle he cleared shortly after the change. The stock didn’t hit $400 until February 2025 and is currently trading at just under $300. The company’s 2025 Say-on-Pay vote—a thumbs-up, thumbs-down nonbinding vote on executive pay—only got support from 53.5% of votes cast. Over the past 14 years, the Russell 3000 index saw average support of about 91% for pay programs. Corpay did not respond to a request for comment. At Axon, Smith’s moonshot deal differs from Musk’s in another key way: It’s open to Smith’s direct reports on down to line workers at Axon, making employees eligible for a version of Smith’s moonshot deal. Workers could give up some salary, put some of their pay at risk, and work to hit revenue targets. Plus, every employee in the U.S. got a grant of 60 performance stock units that vested according to the same milestones in Smith’s award—a move almost unheard of in corporate America. No one other than Smith was able to essentially give up all their pay, said Partovi, mostly because Smith was independently successful enough that if he didn’t cut it and got nothing, he had enough of a cushion. Roughly $75 million in employee compensation was locked up as at-risk pay so employees could take part in the moonshot. “I really think that was a driver behind why the company grew so fast,” said Partovi. “Any element of infighting was gone—everybody was suddenly like, ‘We’re all in this together.’” Smith’s 2023 award went through a significant negotiation process where Partovi heard directly from shareholders about everything they didn’t like about the first plan so he could debug it. The board also attempted to legal-proof it against the type of challenge that Musk’s moonshot faced, prompting one of the compensation committee members who had socialized with Smith to resign from the committee.

If you can invest in music royalties, why can't you also invest in "technology royalties?" That's what Althera42 wants to make possible, betting on revenue growth and scalability of technology startups without having to buy in at high valuations. Founded by Caspar Macqueen, a former BlackRock executive, and Christian Czernich, founder of the private credit firm Round2 Capital, the new fund plans to provide working capital to technology companies in Europe without taking an equity stake. Althera42 will focus on investing in intellectual property that transforms society through agentic AI, data infrastructure, defense and security, robotics and automation, software-enabled services and health and well-being. Don't Miss: "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," Business Insider reported from a company factsheet released in September. According to its website, Althera42 looks to invest in founder-led and late-stage private companies that have software and proprietary technology at their core. Althera42 will build customized deals to receive a fixed percentage of the technology companies' future revenue over several years. Through the royalties model, Althera42 can combine the upside of venture capital with the consistent cash flow of private debt, Czernich told Business Insider. Fund gains will go out to investors quarterly. The fund will charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Althera42 is targeting companies with annual revenue between roughly $17 million and $117 million (€10 million and €100 million) from recurring or licensing models. Trending: Kevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That Royalty investing is the new capital paradigm in an intellectual property-based global economy, according to the company's website. In its stated mission, Althera42 wants to establish technology royalties as a new asset class. It hopes to copy the successful playbook used for tapping into the predictable revenue streams of music and pharmaceuticals. Althera42's website boasts being architects of a new capital model, "transforming recurring revenue into investable royalty streams." Czernich told Business Insider, "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class." See Also: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund Althera42 believes royalty investing aligns its success with that of the company it funds. However, the firm does so by empowering companies to "retain control, by accelerating their impact with capital support that does not compromise their vision or leadership." According to Pitcher Partners, a national association of independent accounting firms in Australia, royalty investing is found across several industries: music, energy, mining, pharmaceuticals and software. Major private equity firms Blackstone and KKR entered the music industry in 2021 and 2022, deploying $500 million to $1 billion, and the energy royalties sector in North America is estimated to be worth between $500 billion and $1 trillion, according to Pitcher Partners' website. Macqueen, formerly BlackRock's head of U.K., Middle East and Africa for the alternatives business Aladdin, told Business Insider the firm plans to pull in $300 million with its first fund and complete 15 to 20 deals. Most deals would likely be in Europe and the U.K., potentially with some North American investments. Althera42 has offices in London and New York.

Title: This Promise Of 70% Dividends From These ETFs Is Totally Bogus
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/10/04/this-promise-of-70-dividends-from-these-etfs-is-totally-bogus/
Time Published: 2025-10-04T16:42:00Z

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. What if you could squeeze, say, a 70% dividend yield from a fast-growing AI stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Palantir (PLTR)? Sounds great, right? Instead of relying just on these stocks’ prices for your profits (since dividends are, frankly, the furthest thing from their CFOs’ minds), you get their returns as high-yielding dividends. That’s something a new breed of ETFs is promising. These funds, which are gaining in popularity, hold just one stock—usually a Palantir, Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA—and trade options on that one stock to deliver stated yields often way above 50%. Does it work? First, let me say that, as someone who has covered 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) for over a decade, I get the sentiment behind these funds. Big income streams can create financial independence—who wouldn’t want as big of a yield as possible? But there’s a line where a dividend goes from appealing to dangerous—and it’s well below the stated 70% distribution rate, as of this writing, on a single-stock ETF like, say, the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY). That’s because, what these funds’ massive yields give, their share prices can easily take away. Consider the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY), which aims to deliver that 70% income stream by holding C3.ai (AI), a developer of AI apps for business. As I write this, AIYY investors have seen a total return of nearly negative 50% since the start of the year. With nearly half of their capital now lost in 2025 (with dividends included), those holding AIYY must be wondering what went wrong. Let’s start with that dividend, because there’s a key thing to note here: Even though AIYY’s website says its distribution rate is 71%, it also tells us that the fund’s 30-day SEC yield is only 4.8%. This means the fund’s net investment income (which can only be calculated by a strict SEC-mandated formula and excludes options income, which can be unpredictable) is much lower than that 70%—which is the payout as a percentage of the fund’s assets. Moreover, AIYY’s distributions keep falling, down 63% in 2025. Let me clear—not all of YieldMax’s 57 ETFs are losing money this year. In fact, most are up. The best return goes to the YieldMax PLTR Option Income Strategy ETF (PLTY), with a stated 49.4% yield. This fund has returned 77.9% for 2025 and is up much more since its inception in late 2024. So, have we found the secret to financial independence here? After all, with this 49.4% income stream, it takes only about $203,000 in upfront investment to get a six-figure income stream! Except, well, there’s a lot of risk behind this seemingly impressive chart. As you probably guessed from the fund name, this ETF tracks Palantir, whose stock has surged as the company wins more government contracts. If you predicted PLTR’s surge, congratulations—that’s impressive. But an investor who knew to invest in PLTR should’ve just bought that stock instead, since PLTY (in purple below) has badly lagged it. This problem is endemic to single-stock ETFs: These funds try to “translate” growth stocks’ gains into big dividends, but in so doing expose us to the risks of a single stock, with less upside. Sure, the income is great when the stock is rising, but that income will shrink if the stock drops. That’s what happened to the 56.2%-yielding YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY), which holds Moderna (MRNA) and is down 39% in 2025 and down even more since its IPO in early 2024. Anyone who bought MRNY and enjoyed the huge yields at the start of 2024 probably thought they were really on to something, as the fund’s total return rose into the spring. They then saw their fortunes reverse as the fund’s price fell. That’s the fate I expect for the aforementioned PLTY if the stock it tracks—again, Palantir—drops. And I see that as likely, since Palantir’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a stratospheric 278 as I write this. So what are these funds for, then? To be honest, I’m not sure. As we’ve seen, investors are almost always better off just buying the underlying stocks. What’s more, some of these ETF issuers are venturing into even riskier territory, like the recently released “Bonk Income Blast ETF,” which doesn’t just invest in crypto, but also in “other crypto ETFs, including non-US crypto-ETFs,” according to its SEC filing. This means investors will wind up paying the fees for this ETF, as well as fees for the ETFs it owns. Plus they’re exposing themselves to the risks of the crypto market and the risks of foreign markets—including potentially lax regulation—too. There’s just no reason to take risks like those when you can get predictable, diversified dividends from CEFs. Sure, CEFs don’t offer the mind-blowing yields of YieldMax and its ilk. But we’ll happily take that “lower” payout—bearing in mind many CEFs yield more than 8%, if it lets us sleep peacefully at night. Moreover, we benefit from CEFs discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), which hold the potential for future upside. ETFs—single stock or no—never offer us a discount. I think you’ll agree that this is a far better deal than a 70%-yielder that’s dropped around 50% in less than a year.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. What if you could squeeze, say, a 70% dividend yield from a fast-growing AI stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Palantir (PLTR)? Sounds great, right? Instead of relying just on these stocks’ prices for your profits (since dividends are, frankly, the furthest thing from their CFOs’ minds), you get their returns as high-yielding dividends. That’s something a new breed of ETFs is promising. These funds, which are gaining in popularity, hold just one stock—usually a Palantir, Tesla (TSLA) or NVIDIA—and trade options on that one stock to deliver stated yields often way above 50%. Does it work? First, let me say that, as someone who has covered 8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) for over a decade, I get the sentiment behind these funds. Big income streams can create financial independence—who wouldn’t want as big of a yield as possible? But there’s a line where a dividend goes from appealing to dangerous—and it’s well below the stated 70% distribution rate, as of this writing, on a single-stock ETF like, say, the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY). That’s because, what these funds’ massive yields give, their share prices can easily take away. Consider the YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (AIYY), which aims to deliver that 70% income stream by holding C3.ai (AI), a developer of AI apps for business. As I write this, AIYY investors have seen a total return of nearly negative 50% since the start of the year. With nearly half of their capital now lost in 2025 (with dividends included), those holding AIYY must be wondering what went wrong. Let’s start with that dividend, because there’s a key thing to note here: Even though AIYY’s website says its distribution rate is 71%, it also tells us that the fund’s 30-day SEC yield is only 4.8%. This means the fund’s net investment income (which can only be calculated by a strict SEC-mandated formula and excludes options income, which can be unpredictable) is much lower than that 70%—which is the payout as a percentage of the fund’s assets. Moreover, AIYY’s distributions keep falling, down 63% in 2025. Let me clear—not all of YieldMax’s 57 ETFs are losing money this year. In fact, most are up. The best return goes to the YieldMax PLTR Option Income Strategy ETF (PLTY), with a stated 49.4% yield. This fund has returned 77.9% for 2025 and is up much more since its inception in late 2024. So, have we found the secret to financial independence here? After all, with this 49.4% income stream, it takes only about $203,000 in upfront investment to get a six-figure income stream! Except, well, there’s a lot of risk behind this seemingly impressive chart. As you probably guessed from the fund name, this ETF tracks Palantir, whose stock has surged as the company wins more government contracts. If you predicted PLTR’s surge, congratulations—that’s impressive. But an investor who knew to invest in PLTR should’ve just bought that stock instead, since PLTY (in purple below) has badly lagged it. This problem is endemic to single-stock ETFs: These funds try to “translate” growth stocks’ gains into big dividends, but in so doing expose us to the risks of a single stock, with less upside. Sure, the income is great when the stock is rising, but that income will shrink if the stock drops. That’s what happened to the 56.2%-yielding YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY), which holds Moderna (MRNA) and is down 39% in 2025 and down even more since its IPO in early 2024. Anyone who bought MRNY and enjoyed the huge yields at the start of 2024 probably thought they were really on to something, as the fund’s total return rose into the spring. They then saw their fortunes reverse as the fund’s price fell. That’s the fate I expect for the aforementioned PLTY if the stock it tracks—again, Palantir—drops. And I see that as likely, since Palantir’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a stratospheric 278 as I write this. So what are these funds for, then? To be honest, I’m not sure. As we’ve seen, investors are almost always better off just buying the underlying stocks. What’s more, some of these ETF issuers are venturing into even riskier territory, like the recently released “Bonk Income Blast ETF,” which doesn’t just invest in crypto, but also in “other crypto ETFs, including non-US crypto-ETFs,” according to its SEC filing. This means investors will wind up paying the fees for this ETF, as well as fees for the ETFs it owns. Plus they’re exposing themselves to the risks of the crypto market and the risks of foreign markets—including potentially lax regulation—too. There’s just no reason to take risks like those when you can get predictable, diversified dividends from CEFs. Sure, CEFs don’t offer the mind-blowing yields of YieldMax and its ilk. But we’ll happily take that “lower” payout—bearing in mind many CEFs yield more than 8%, if it lets us sleep peacefully at night. Moreover, we benefit from CEFs discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), which hold the potential for future upside. ETFs—single stock or no—never offer us a discount. I think you’ll agree that this is a far better deal than a 70%-yielder that’s dropped around 50% in less than a year.

Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.” It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “about cash flow and buybacks and dividends than…about the honest hard work of engineering innovation.” Under these conditions the defense department’s subsidies for private business, he writes in “The Defense Reformation,” have neither “the supposed advantages of a planned economy nor the (far superior) advantages of a free market.” Sankar is the CTO and executive vice-president of Palantir, the start-up cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel that specializes in a peculiar hybrid of big-data manipulation and McKinsey-style consulting work. Many of Sankar’s Palantir colleagues and peers at other Thielworld start-ups—notably Anduril, which bills itself as a pioneering disruptor in software-heavy military hardware—have advanced a similar criticism of the neoliberal state, bemoaning its declining interventions in manufacturing and research and lambasting the legacy defense firms, often nicknamed “primes,” for their sclerosis, inefficiency, and alleged monopolistic behavior. The innovative, capitalist spirit and manly vitalism that defined the defense department through the cold war is, for this group, long gone. The task of the hour, as Sankar writes in “The Defense Reformation,” is therefore nothing less than “to resurrect the American Industrial Base.” You might think this would mean something like what, under the previous administration, went by the name Bidenomics: initiatives such as the CHIPS Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, which paled in comparison to total federal defense spending—the combined estimated cost of those two bills, which would be spread over a number of years, was about half the annual defense bill—but nonetheless aimed to bring high-tech manufacturing back to US shores. You would be wrong. “The most important and malleable weapons system,” Sankar writes, is not missiles or other military hardware but software, by which he presumably means technologies like large-scale data manipulation, narrow forms of computerized optimization applied to “smart” weapons systems and robotics, sensors, autonomous weapons systems, and artificial intelligence. Investing lavishly in such technology and teaching “our warriors…to wield the software industrial base to maximize lethality” will catalyze what Sankar has elsewhere called a “software-driven reindustrialization” akin to previous industrial revolutions based around water, steam, coal, or oil. For a range of figures in the emergent defense-tech sector to which Palantir and Anduril belong, this will require wrenching guaranteed contracts from the bloated primes and promoting competition by having branches of the armed services bid against one another, not to mention allowing even more sales elsewhere. It will also require binding the state closer to a range of tech giants—especially firms like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft­—that have thus far, on this view, neglected their patriotic duty to engage in defense work and profited from feminized “ad-tech” instead. These arguments have found a broad and receptive audience. In recent years a range of politicians have aligned themselves with the priorities of defense-tech firms, especially as successive White Houses worry about a belligerent Russia, a rising China, and the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid-induced supply shocks—all of which have reenergized a longstanding criticism of Reagan-era political-economic shifts that hobbled productive industries. The Obama and Biden administrations both empowered tech companies at the expense of the primes; Biden, skeptical of free trade and hawkish on China, courted Silicon Valley firms that promised to bring back domestic manufacturing and reindustrialize the rust belt and former defense hubs. But in recent years talk about “software-driven reindustrialization” has become especially widespread on a faction of the new right. That the Trump adviser and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer could rail on X against Lockheed Martin, with its “woke agenda,” for “delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat”—and that Elon Musk could respond to her that, in any case, “crewed aircraft will be destroyed instantly by cheap drone swarms”—owes much to the rhetoric of Sankar and his peers. This new Silicon Valley defense-tech and finance group—their grievances, ideology, and policy visions—has become central to Trump’s second term. Several defense-tech boosters have assumed powerful positions in the administration, most notably one of Anduril’s former senior directors, Michael Obadal, who was just confirmed as Army under secretary, the second-highest ranking civilian official in the Army. Since January Palantir and Anduril have received many billions in contracts, with more on the way. ICE has contracted Palantir since 2011 for software it uses to enforce sanctions and make arrests, and in April signed a new $30 million contract with the company to, in The New York Times’s words, “build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.” Presumably the deal will help ICE’s director, Todd Lyons, realize a vision he laid out that same month at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix, where he said that he wants his agency to run like Amazon Prime, “but with human beings.” Advertisement These trends show no signs of stopping. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Department of Defense—now calling itself the Department of War—to increase its spending on software, which, he stresses, is “at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Trump has signed executive orders designed to ease restrictions on defense exports and speed up and reduce oversight of the DoD’s acquisition process. In September the army announced a new venture-capital-style model for procurement called “Fuze.” Firms like Palantir and their new constellation of Silicon Valley funders stand to benefit handsomely from these developments. “We’re moving to a software-driven, autonomous…battlefield,” the managing director for a prominent private equity firm said at a defense summit earlier this year. “Well, if you want daily software upgrades, you gotta pay software margins.” * Few would contest that the political economy of American defense is troubled. Defense monopolies have stifled competition; companies have slowed their investment in production and concentrated instead on payouts to themselves and shareholders; costs and schedules have spun out of control. By now, as the scholar William Hartung has written, the federal government’s ballooning defense budget goes increasingly to “costly, dysfunctional weapons systems that are ill-suited to addressing current challenges.” Yet venture-funded defense-tech firms like Palantir and Anduril have positioned themselves as the solution to these ills without any clear evidence that they can deliver on that promise. The problem, put simply, is that they don’t have expertise in building things. Because they are above all instruments of financialization, designed to bring future values into the present, they tend to be better at generating short-term profits and juicing shareholder value than at creating durable, high-performing software or hardware systems. Anduril and other companies that offer “autonomous,” AI-enhanced hardware, for instance, have by now attracted criticism from a range of commentators: the evidence indicates that, despite their claims to the contrary, Silicon Valley drones and counterdrones have underperformed in Ukraine, where fighters have tended to prefer cheaper, hardier Chinese and homegrown drones instead. Adopting Palantir’s signature data-organizing software, too, could have significant problems for companies and government agencies in the long term. The software’s code is closed-source and privately hosted by Palantir, which retains the power—subject to the terms of its contracts and to the extent they prove enforceable—to change, update, or terminate it. Using it as the “data backbone” for a vast and complicated system makes it distinctly costly and burdensome to switch software in the future, not to mention to train and retrain its users. Meanwhile, as several critics have argued, the user loses a significant measure of control over the system itself. “The single fundamental problem with the Palantir contract is that the government is outsourcing all of the work to one company in one go,” a data expert told the New Statesman earlier this year, “and what you get is vendor lock-in. The state doesn’t understand the work, they can’t see the work…. You develop no knowledge, no understanding of it.” On the podcast Second Breakfast, the lawyer and former Army officer Eric Robinson related that, when he used Palantir’s software in the 2010s, “they would recode your data ingest so you couldn’t export it again,” with the result that “you had to pay for their tech to effectively be part of your order of battle…. It often seems like a form of long-term rent seeking.” In the telling of companies like Palantir and Anduril, their innovation, efficiency, and software expertise qualify them to jump-start a new era of American industrial policy. But not only do they seem ill-suited for such a task, they have publicly backed the Trump administration as it destroys the foundations of what industrial policy the country has. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, has, for instance, denounced “wokeness” for “corrupting and corroding our institutions,” echoing the rhetoric that Trump and other Republicans have used to attack measures like the CHIPS Act for including some redistributive initiatives and giving workers benefits like child care. We are now in a situation, in other words, where an array of right-wing firms and think tanks perversely extol the virtues of industrial policy and American renewal even as they support politicians and financial institutions that are currently dismantling the infrastructure to actually do industrial policy. Advertisement How did we get here? The answer lies, in part, in the fact that defense-related industries like the semiconductor sector have themselves long obscured their real relationship to industrial policy. It is a central tragedy of the long US century that military Keynesianism—the use of military spending to spur economic growth and enable spending on welfare and other public goods—has been the organizing principle for the country’s economy and social life since World War II. The defense budget—last year’s allocation was close to $900 billion—goes not just to weapons construction but also to a welfare state within a state: housing, health care, and social services. It funds a great deal of civilian industry, from wooden pallets to satellites and smartphones, not to mention research fundamental to the US economy and some degree of economic redistribution. Because of its sheer scale and reach, defense spending is unique in its ability to facilitate regional coalitions across party lines by directing funding to specific geographical targets: state-specific projects, bases, consortia, and so on. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons An armorer’s assistant installing a machine gun in a Lockheed P-38 plane at an aircraft plant in the Western US, circa November 1942 By forcing policymakers to appeal to “national security” (which since the 1980s has expanded to encompass “economic security”)1 to justify any efforts at industrial policy or social welfare, this system has long hobbled our ability to build a better world. But during the 1970s and 1980s, when a newly organized right wing took aim at state spending and capacity across the board, even the essential national-security fields of electronics and defense found their access to long-term government support under threat. To retain it, they arrived at a kind of truce. In public, these firms would happily chalk their success up to their own entrepreneurial genius. Under the radar, however, a range of policymakers and industry leaders worked to patch together a precarious, largely hidden system of government support that allowed the businesses—albeit in compromised form—to keep relying on federal planning, funding, and stewardship. Now the new Silicon Valley defense firms are taking advantage of this state of affairs to press their own interests. Rather than downplaying their reliance on the government in public while reaping the benefits of industrial policy in practice, though, they have done just the opposite, indulging in rhetoric about the return of the strong state and “reindustrialization” even as they help dismantle the state in the service of financial capital. Understanding the implications of this shift requires grasping the complexities of the relationship that tech and defense firms have long enjoyed with US state power. 2. In moments of “revolutionary crisis,” Karl Marx wrote, men “anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.” The defense-tech elite are no exception: they talk obsessively about the past, transmuting political-economic reality into a story of great-men-as-founders. Karp praises the Manhattan Project and welcomes comparisons to Oppenheimer. A Los Angeles Times piece from last year discovered that Palmer Luckey, the much-profiled founder of Anduril, has a preoccupation with purchasing cold war military relics: the red nuclear phone, “a couple of submarines,” at least one ICBM site. He hopes one day, the profile notes, to acquire “the entire US ground-based nuclear deterrent system…to turn it into a vast museum.” Their account of twentieth-century military-economic history is distinctly revisionist. In his appearance last year on The Merge, Sankar explained how to fix the defense-industrial base. “The reality is you focus on winning,” he said: I’m not a founder of Palantir, but I think about going back to that World War II–era period and the immediate cold war, it was founders. We think of it as Northrop Grumman and Martin Marietta, but it was Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin and Howard Hughes and Henry Kaiser, and even inside of government, the Kelly Johnsons, the John Boyds. These are uniquely hardheaded, creative, difficult people that are required to win. And I think every start-up understands that. That’s what a start-up looks like. The truth is dramatically different. The two world wars turned industrial power into US military dominance not because they empowered the genius of individuals but because they built a new and formidable state.2 Industrial and state capacity—not to mention the relationship between industry and government—were forever transformed. World War I inaugurated the use of cost-plus contracts, which stipulate that the government pay for all the costs of development and production plus a set profit. World War II offered the US a taste of a centralized planned economy: the war effort consumed 57 percent of the national income, and the government itself converted all the plants it needed to manufacture war material.3 In 1942, for instance, the War Production Board—which centralized control of investment and production—forced the whiskey industry to divert 60 percent of its production to industrial alcohol and modernized productive processes. It would not be an exaggeration to attribute the many new industries that emerged, modernized, or accelerated in the postwar years—aeronautics, vastly improved automobiles and motors, chemical and especially petrochemical firms, modern shipbuilding, electronics, atomic energy, logistics—to centralized government planning and funding. With government help, as Hartung notes in his study Prophets of War, the aviation industry’s production increased by 13,500 percent.4 New plants cropped up across the country, especially in the South and West, inaugurating the long-term industrialization of those regions. Cooperative large-scale applied research proliferated through the National Defense Research Committee, which commandeered both industry and academic resources and personnel. In his 1992 study of US industrial policy, the historian Otis Graham noted that the Defense Plant Corporation built “some 30 percent of the plant capacity on which American mobilization depended,” which was crucial to the postwar aircraft industry.5 Business leaders resisted their subjection to government administrators, and as soon as the war was over they sought to erase these years from public memory. But the fact remained that US defense contractors and technology firms owed their existence to extensive, heavy-handed government planning. * Government support, oversight, and coordination of important industries largely persisted throughout the cold war. In the immediate postwar period military contracts slowed, but the Korean War ensured another boom that lasted until the wind down of the Vietnam War two decades later. The Department of Defense “directed a large portion of the nation’s scientific and engineering resources throughout the postwar era,” Graham wrote, “frequently picking winning technologies and products by supplying the military’s clients—chiefly the weapons, aerospace, telecommunications, and data processing industries—with R&D support and purchasing of output.” The government covered nearly all basic research (which mostly occurs at government labs and universities), and much of the research and development conducted by private industry. Companies had plenty of money to invest and reinvest in production—and the DoD pressured them to do just that. Science History Institute An employee inspecting the control board for a solvent recovery system at the Hercules Powder Company plant in Hopewell, Virginia, 1940s As the scholar Christophe Lécuyer shows in his study Making Silicon Valley, all this investment made the US semiconductor industry possible.6 DoD contracts remade Fairchild, the industry’s pioneering firm, into a major company, and Fairchild in turn brought suppliers and equipment-makers to the Bay Area. The DoD not only funded the development of microelectronics but prioritized incorporating them into military systems; starting in 1963, Lécuyer notes, proposals had to include them for the projects to receive funding. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara’s initiatives before and especially during the Vietnam War transformed defense spending and the industrial policy associated with it. Much was made by General Westmoreland, starting in the late 1960s, of the promise that war would become an “electronic battlefield,” with armies taking advantage of all “the advanced technology of communications, sensors, fire direction, and the required automatic data processing” to control the fighting from afar.7 That this vision failed to materialize and cost the US dearly—in lives, reputation, and resources—doesn’t seem to have led anyone to rethink its premises. In the late 1960s disenchanted defense workers organized to shift industries such as chemicals and electronics away from war and toward the public good, or at least toward private consumption—an effort known as “civilianization.” At the same time, a civilian market for computer chips was exploding. Those initiatives, the planned Vietnam wind down, and détente with the USSR all helped shrink the federal government’s spending on defense in general and military R&D in particular. But it was a brief experiment that came with significant backlash, helping propel Reagan to the presidency and shaping his industrial policy. The federal share of research dollars remained high for much of the cold war, funding the development of lasers, nuclear energy, rockets, aerospace, computers, scientific instruments, data processing, and telecommunications while neglecting automobiles, steel, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—all of which moved offshore to a greater degree than they already had. 3. The first major political-economic changes after World War II came with the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and 1990s. During these years several crises descended upon a range of productive sectors that had historically relied on federal industrial policy. Internationally, Japan perfected production techniques in high-tech manufacturing—of cars, machine tools, memory chips, and other electronics—and quickly approached dominance in many areas considered central to “national security,” like semiconductors and supercomputing. American pundits at the time identified this trend as a direct threat to American-style capitalism and US power.8 The period’s neoliberal economic reforms—which reduced and limited the nature of government spending while demonizing the most basic forms of long-term planning—weakened productive industries still further, leaving manufacturers beholden to shareholder demands for ever more profits and vulnerable to new threats from financial institutions. These conditions posed a distinct threat to productive sectors like the semiconductor industry. And yet Intel, which by 1992 was leading the industry in cutting-edge chips, managed to thrive nonetheless. When reporters asked how they did it, the company’s executives pointed to what they called “Moore’s Law,” the idea, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, that chips regularly became smaller and more powerful according to something like a natural principle. Moore’s Law became a fixture of the industry’s marketing presentations, press releases, and internal conferences.9 Over the years it helped convince defense leaders like Clinton’s secretary of defense, William Perry, and his protégée Ash Carter that technological solutions could eventually be found for their most pressing and difficult political problems. Moore’s Law remains an unquestioned assumption of scientific, military and national security state discourse and policy, undergirding the entire political-economic imagination of the post–cold war United States. Just as intellectuals started worrying that there might be fundamental limits to capitalist growth, it posited a horizon of infinite progress. The truth was more complicated. Intel, founded in 1968 by Moore and Robert Noyce, came to prominence by developing some of the first commercial metal-oxide semiconductor chips. Those semiconductors had immediate, tangible benefits, including low power consumption, high noise immunity, and cost efficiency. Working from that basis, the company did regularly improve its output with a kind of lawlike consistency in this era. But it wasn’t Moore’s Law that won the battle with the Japanese. Instead, Intel and others in the semiconductor industry built coalitions to carve out exceptions to many of the period’s neoliberal reforms, reaping the benefits of extraordinary state support. Among other things, the Reagan administration offered tax incentives to subsidize factory construction and investment in manufacturing, encouraged coordination and cartelization by offering antimonopoly relief and state planning, and used economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to force concessions from Japan, such as giving foreign—which in effect meant US—chip manufacturers 20 percent of their market share and sharing significant manufacturing knowledge. Intel Free Press/Wikimedia Commons Andy Grove (left), the longtime head of Intel, sitting with the company’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, 1978 Under Reagan it was an open secret that the government’s treatment of the semiconductor industry, among others, amounted to a form of industrial policy. These measures had the backing of a powerful—if peculiar—bipartisan coalition that was preoccupied with sustaining American hegemony: national security and foreign policy hawks, factions in the business world, and a group of tech-friendly liberals, like Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas and Tennessee senator Al Gore, who became known as the “Atari Democrats.” They were reacting to a new right that objected to industrial policy as such, on the grounds that any government planning and economic intervention smacked of communism: in late 1980 the first installment of the Heritage Foundation’s Mandate for Leadership—like its successor, Project 2025—called for destroying large swaths of government by loosening regulations and oversight, centralizing power in the executive, demolishing state capacity, and eliminating or significantly cutting funding for many programs and agencies. The new right lacked the political leverage to end industrial policy entirely. But between 1980 and 1993 they succeeded at making it politically toxic, forcing the industry and its allies to adjust their tactics. Bill Clinton, an Atari Democrat, took office hoping to build the US’s own version of Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry; however hostile he was to labor, he implemented significant industrial policy for semiconductors immediately after his election. After Newt Gingrich’s Contract for America coalition swept Congress in 1994, however, the administration’s room for maneuver narrowed. It was still able to ensure some level of subsidies and planning for semiconductor firms like Intel. But it came to rely heavily on foreign policy measures—like sanctions, trade deals, diplomatic pressure, and throwing around US power to shape new international economic organizations like the World Trade Organization—to open new markets and ensure other benefits for tech companies. By the end of Clinton’s second term, a kind of tacit settlement had locked into place. Even as they continued to depend on these various forms of state support, semiconductor companies, tech entrepreneurs who relied on ever-improving semiconductors, and politicians on both sides of the aisle would insist they owed their success to the information-tech revolution, with its promise of infinite growth and cheap consumer goods, all predicated on the work of individual entrepreneurial geniuses. This rift between rhetoric and reality has only grown since. Today’s executives hardly seem to understand the conditions of their own industries; it is as if, on some level, they believe the flattering public narrative their predecessors spun. During his interview on The Merge, Sankar remarked that he and his peers are “children…of a Noycean culture.” In a sense this is not untrue. Intel’s Noyce and Sankar both downplay their industry’s debt to industrial policy; Palantir, not unlike Intel before it, is in part in the business of selling what Wired recently called “a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems.” But Sankar clearly meant the analogy in a different sense: to lay claim to Noyce’s record of success, to brandish his legacy of American entrepreneurial technological genius, and to insist that Silicon Valley firms’ track record of such triumphs should entitle them to remake government in their own image. * The defense industry faced the same pressures that nearly destroyed US semiconductor firms at the dawn of the post–cold war era. In his last year in office Jimmy Carter reversed the cuts that had depressed the industry for much of the 1970s, and in his first term Reagan initiated an enormous military buildup. All this, Graham writes, strengthened the military’s claim on “the nation’s scientific and engineering resources, and thus its influence on industrial structure.” But other developments spelled trouble. By the early 1980s financial regulations were being loosened, and corporations were under increasing pressure—legal, managerial, and structural—to secure shareholder profits in the short term at the expense of long-term health. A low-margin productive industry like defense was badly suited to the era. By the mid-1980s firms were focusing on increasing their financial performance by using stock buybacks and cost-reduction strategies like just-in-time inventory management—ordering only enough resources to cover immediate needs. All this compromised their ability to respond flexibly to crises and to make high-quality products. In 1985 the Reagan administration started reducing defense spending again and limited other avenues for profit. Facing increased political scrutiny, Reagan officials had recently made a big show of auditing firms for the appearance of wasteful spending, introducing policies that tightened defense profits and increased accounting paperwork. Many companies, like GE, curtailed their defense wings or left the sector entirely to boost their stock values for an increasingly defense-skeptical Wall Street. The 1980s also saw the rise of corporate raiders, later known as private equity firms, which would acquire a majority share of a company’s stock, take control of its operations, and then “restructure” it, which usually meant stripping it for parts and paying themselves astronomical sums of money. Between 1982 and 1990 such outfits nearly destroyed several defense firms, including Martin Marietta and Lockheed, and left them weakened with large debt-to-equity ratios. With loosened financial rules and low margins came consolidation: between 1985 and 1988 ten of the top sixty defense firms acquired or were acquired by others. Perhaps no person’s career tracks how the defense industry navigated these changes more clearly than that of Norm Augustine. Born in 1935, Augustine got his start in defense at the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1958. His first foray into government came in 1965 as one of McNamara’s young hires, brought in from the private sector to cut waste using “economic efficiency” measures like cost-benefit analysis. He then ping-ponged between the public and private defense sectors: after serving as the under secretary of the Army he joined Martin Marietta, then one of the country’s largest defense firms. Between 1980 and 1982, meanwhile, he chaired the Defense Science Board, authoring reports on threats to the defense industrial base and its dependence on the troubled semiconductor sector. Rising in the ranks of Martin Marietta over the 1980s, Augustine saw that defense was in turmoil; he later referred to the decade as the industry’s “dark ages.” Denver Post/Getty Images Martin Marietta CEO Thomas G. Pownall (center) and Norman Augustine (right) talking with a shareholder, 1983 The fall of the USSR and Clinton’s electoral victory brought a new existential threat. Federal defense funding plummeted: between 1989 and 1997 procurement declined by 60 percent. The result was something like the industry’s Great Depression; in 1995 Augustine told a House committee that an estimated three quarters of the sector, about 90,000 firms, had evaporated in the span of a decade. As defense programs became fewer and more expensive, the remaining firms started making riskier bids, overpromising on cost, time, and quality. In 1993 Clinton’s defense secretary, Les Aspin, invited the CEOs of major defense firms to the Pentagon for a dinner that would become known as the “last supper.” The then-deputy defense secretary, William Perry, showed them a slideshow of necessary defense capacity: “We expect defense companies to go out of business,” he told them. When we talked in a recent interview, Augustine told me he feared the administration would nationalize at least significant parts of the industry. They were faced with either entering new markets, consolidating, or downsizing. In the five years that followed, Augustine consolidated many firms under Lockheed Martin, itself the product of the merger of Lockeed and Martin Marietta, forming the country’s largest defense firm. In 1995 the new company went public, at which point it started prioritizing stock prices and other contemporary markers of financial health. It worked: in 1997 Augustine wrote that the company’s share price had nearly doubled in two years. And yet in the process Lockheed Martin closed a quarter of its plants and laid off 100,000 workers, vastly paring down management and labor in the name of efficiency. The benefits of all this cost-cutting rarely went to the government. Nor were many of the gains reinvested in production. Lockheed Martin had become good at getting contracts; Augustine wrote in the Harvard Business Review about harnessing the “natural competitive instincts in human beings.” But the products themselves suffered: they were more expensive, slower to deliver, and of lower quality. * The state’s priorities were also changing. The Gulf War seemed to vindicate Westmoreland’s Vietnam-era dreams of an “electronic battlefield.” William Perry, soon elevated to defense secretary, became a firm believer that the US was on the cusp of a “revolution in military affairs”—the idea, as the RAND analyst Paul K. Davis has summarized it, that “technological developments sometimes make possible a qualitative change in the nature of warfare.” That conviction moved him to prioritize funding, developing, and promoting “dual-use” technologies that could be applied to both commercial and military settings. He and Clinton built closer relationships with technology firms, offering them greater access to government and policymaking.10 In the late 1990s, as the researcher Barry D. Watts notes in a 2008 report, the Pentagon encouraged defense companies to “act more like commercial firms.” Augustine was well-positioned to adapt to these conditions. He had advocated for government support for the semiconductor industry during its crisis: asking “why DoD or the government should provide support for the semiconductor industry,” he testified to the Senate in 1987, “would be much like asking at the outset of World War II why we should buy ships and airplanes because it might help the shipbuilding and the aircraft industries.” From his perch on initiatives like the Defense Science Board, he not only observed but shaped how Intel and others had navigated the changing political-economic waters; now he hoped to replicate their accomplishments. Between 1993 and 1998, as Hartung has shown, Augustine lobbied intensely—and successfully—for immense government subsidies for defense in general and the new Lockheed Martin in particular. Those subsidies came in many forms, from aid for mergers—“closing plants, relocating equipment, paying severance to laid-off workers, and providing ‘golden parachutes’ to board members and executives,” as Hartung puts it—to antitrust exemptions and subsidies for arms exports (especially to new NATO countries). “To say that Augustine is wired into the Washington policy-making process is an understatement,” Hartung noted in 1996. “For most of his career, he has been one of a handful of people drawing up the blueprints for American defense policies and deciding where the wiring should be placed.” In the 1990s companies like Intel experimented with setting up their own venture capital arms, government-backed consortia, and new institutions whose purpose was to plan and shape the markets around them. Augustine followed their lead: he and other defense industry leaders managed to insulate themselves both from democratic accountability and from the vagaries of anti-statist politics by creating experimental public institutions. In 1998 George Tenet’s CIA enlisted Augustine to help found a nonprofit venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that gives start-ups long-term guidance and directs them to lucrative, stable government contracts. Unlike traditional VCs, In-Q-Tel claims to focus more on technology and less on profits, though over the years it seems to have helped these new companies make money more than it has helped the government acquire important technology. It was In-Q-Tel that assured the success of, among others, Palantir, Anduril, and the drone company Skydio. Augustine, who turned ninety this July, hardly ever uses words like “industrial policy” or “neoliberalism,” but in practice he and his peers became influential critics of the neoliberal turn. He has argued that, in the financialized economy, “the tax structure discourages long-term investments” and lamented that shareholders hoping for short-range profit want Lockheed Martin not to “invest in research.” Elsewhere, he has called for renewed federal funding for public education and criticized US companies for moving “much of their manufacturing capability abroad.” In an influential 2005 report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, he and his colleagues argued that “the prosperity the United States enjoys today is due in no small part to investments the nation has made in research and development at universities, corporations, and national laboratories over the last fifty years.” The “pressures” on that sector, they warned, “could seriously erode this past success.” In such moments, Augustine sounds uncannily both like architects of Bidenomics such as Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris and like right-wing tech-defense figures such as Sankar, who has similarly criticized “the financialization of the defense industrial base.” There is a certain irony here: by founding In-Q-Tel and seeding a bipartisan consensus around what plagued America’s political economy, Augustine—perhaps inadvertently—helped create the coalition now hoping to displace the company he has spent much of his life running. 4. Defense stocks tanked in 1998 and 1999, and credit agencies downgraded their debt to nearly “uninvestable” levels. As the industry consolidated, firms got even bigger, more complex, and, via joint contracts, increasingly linked to one another. By 2000 they were in a delicate position. With relatively low profits and cash flow but high debt-to-equity ratios, they increasingly focused less on investing in essential R&D than on trying to grow in the short term by competing recklessly for contracts. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division A pilot operating the instrument panel of the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules cargo plane during a demonstration flight for Pentagon personnel and press over Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 1998 Then came the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, as Hartung has shown in Prophets of War, inaugurated an industry-wide bonanza. Companies like Lockheed Martin entered new markets: “enhanced interrogation,” translation, dubiously legal surveillance. The Bush administration was full of defense monopoly affiliates, among them Secretary of the Air Force James Roche, a former vice president at Northrop Grumman; Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, a former executive at General Dynamics; and Edward Aldridge, who was a member of Lockheed Martin’s board of directors while serving on the president’s commission on space. Congress subsidized Lockheed Martin for arming new Eastern European NATO members; in 2008 US companies accounted for two thirds of the world’s new arms sales. At the same time, the DoD came to focus on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism techniques that relied heavily on information technology, like cyberwar and “network-centric warfare.” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to make “the leap into the information age” by pursuing drones and surveillance. None of this meant that the trend toward military privatization slowed. It continued apace through the Iraq War, from the US military’s contracts with mercenaries like Blackwater to private contracts for hardware. On Second Breakfast, the former Green Beret Justin McIntosh describes how outsourcing military functions to contractors during the Syrian conflict forced him into a situation not unlike The Wages of Fear: I had a truck that had a bent rod. These trucks that we’re driving around in, these MRAPs and these large RG-33s…[require] a contractor [to] come in and work on it. We were in an area where we had been shot at. I had to medically evacuate some guys. The contractors did not want to travel. They wanted me to drive this truck hundreds of kilometers to the safe base where they could then repair it. The problem, McIntosh continued, was that “we had already taken all of that capability that existed within the United States military”—for instance, the ability to repair its own equipment—and “shifted it over to the private sector. It gave them control.” * This tendency toward privatization continued through the Obama administration, during which defense officials started to fixate on reducing costs. (“The gusher has been turned off,” Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced in 2010.) Obama saw bloated defense monopolies as an obstacle to this goal. But rather than addressing the structure of the industry or its political economy, the administration focused on improving its topline numbers by switching out the supposedly corrupt, atrophied defense giants for new firms from the Democrat-friendly tech sector, which promised to replace the functions of the legacy firms more cheaply. An influential proponent of this turn was Ash Carter, whom Obama nominated as his defense secretary in 2014. Carter and his deputy, Robert Work, had a “simple but ambitious” agenda, as the anthropologist Roberto González has written: “to harness the best and brightest ideas from the tech industry for Pentagon use.”11 Carter’s emphasis would be not on training soldiers but on developing drones, automation, satellites, and other cutting-edge defense technologies sourced from Silicon Valley. Carter’s focus on unmanned tech was not exactly a break from the Bush era, but the shift to the Valley was. Fueled by experiments like In-Q-Tel, the tech-defense coalition was already looking to gain market share: in 2014, nearly a year before Carter took office, SpaceX sued the Air Force for preferring the primes; in 2016 Palantir filed a lawsuit against the Army for allegedly trying to develop internal intelligence software without adequately considering commercial options. (One of Anduril’s founders, Trae Stephens, has claimed that these lawsuits helped Anduril win defense department contracts.)12 Obama and then Trump both also expanded the department’s ability to use its “other transaction authority,” which allows the government to do business more easily with commercial entities, for example by letting it sign contracts faster and with less oversight. The defense start-ups that successfully attracted Silicon Valley financing relied on the extraordinary wealth and political lobbying connections of their founders. “Every defense company that had been founded by a billionaire was a success,” as Luckey—who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion—noted in 2024. “I hate that we live in a country where that’s the case,” he added. “But I realized that I had a unique responsibility as one of the very few people who was willing to work on national security and blessed with the resources to actually make a real go at it.” Obama officials proved receptive to such lobbying. During his tenure Carter set up an In-Q-Tel-inspired program called Defense Innovation Unit—Experimental (DIUx), which worked closely with a new Defense Innovation Board, chaired by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to determine the government’s investments in emerging technology, from drones to AI. It encouraged Silicon Valley firms and funders with the promise of long-term contracts for defense tech, as well as evaluation and testing—in effect ensuring their success in advance. Carter also laid the foundations for projects that came to fruition under the first Trump administration: between 2017 and 2019 the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy all launched their own experimental institutions designed to set up tech start-ups with military contracts. Private equity and venture capital saw an opportunity to make nearly guaranteed profits off the government’s investments. Between 2021 and 2024, VCs poured $130 billion into defense. In their book Unit X (2024), two of DIUx’s early directors, Raj M. Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff, claim that by 2017 their work had excited “investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley” about working with the Pentagon by lowering “barriers to entry.” (They decline to specify which ones.) When James Mattis visited DIUx under the first Trump administration, in 2017, Shah and Kirchhoff arranged for him to have dinner with the tech investor Sam Altman (then at Y-Combinator) and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who insisted that the Valley was interested in the defense industry and implored him to support the project. Mattis was enticed by the work they were doing on drones—a later fixation of Andreessen’s. Employees at Google expressed discontent with the company’s defense contracts, organizing to block initiatives like Project Maven, a machine learning program for the Pentagon. The project was hardly promising: as Alexander Cockburn wrote last year in Harper’s, an Air Force testing unit found in 2011 that, “among numerous other deficiencies,” the drone-mounted cameras on which it relied “could not ‘readily find and identify targets,’ and its transmission rate was too slow.” But DoD funders were eager to collaborate with Silicon Valley all the same. (According to Cockburn, Amazon, Microsoft, and Palantir were among the subcontractors who joined the Maven project after Google declined to renew the contract in 2018.) Since then employers have used the threat of AI to shrink the pool of tech jobs, costing the workers leverage. By 2022 employee dissent had been largely squashed: Google and other major defense firms all but declared that they were happy to work with the military. Now executives at tech and tech-defense firms brag about joining the army reserves to help with the design and purchase of their products—an arrangement that seems rife with potential conflicts of interest. The Biden administration continued many of these Obama-Trump trends. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appointed Apple’s Doug Beck to direct DIU—as it was by now simply called—and empowered him to report directly to Austin. Congress gave the program nearly $1 billion for the 2024 financial year, and Biden awarded important hardware contracts to Palantir and Anduril. SpaceX doubled its federal contracts at the beginning of the Biden administration; they had practically doubled again by the end. In late 2022 Austin established the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to push investment in defense-oriented small businesses and tech start-ups; under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it will have $200 billion to spend, and likely more in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Perhaps most visibly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks enthusiastically embraced all things tech: at a 2024 event organized by Andreessen’s VC firm, she emphasized that “moving fast and breaking things is necessary to win wars.” Nonetheless DIU’s leaders and their Silicon Valley allies felt that the Biden Department of Defense wasn’t friendly enough. By 2023, Shah and Kirchhoff complain, it still awarded most of its contracts to the primes. “It seemed as if the whole Biden team had forgotten about DIU and Silicon Valley,” they write, “even as Ukraine was aggressively deploying DIU technologies on the battlefield.” Their vision for the department is blunt: “All the Pentagon needs to do is be a great customer. Buy products, and trust that good venture capitalists will pour money into the companies building those products.” * All this support for the tech-defense sector has so far had disappointing results. A congressionally mandated report produced this year by the Government Accountability Office suggests that there were no metrics by which DIU could measure its success at actually bringing new technology into the military. The Biden defense department’s embrace of tech yielded such fruits as the “Replicator Initiative,” which committed in August 2023 to delivering “multiple thousands” of new autonomous systems in eighteen to twenty-four months. Hartung told me that many industry experts found that timeline hard to believe: no program had ever delivered products that fast. The deadline the initiative set has now passed, and his skepticism seems warranted. The initial delivery was said to be in the hundreds, and The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some of the program’s systems “have been unreliable, or were so expensive or slow to be manufactured they couldn’t be bought in the quantity needed.”For many observers, the first real test of Silicon Valley defense tech is how US-made drone technology fares in Ukraine, a war often cited as a laboratory for unmanned warfare. In a speech this past August, published in the Free Press, Luckey described going to the front lines “just a few weeks” after the full-scale Russian invasion “to train Ukrainian soldiers on advanced military technology that I had developed.” He witnessed “remarkable” feats, he said: “with drones costing just a few thousand dollars each, a handful of Ukrainian pilots remotely carpeted airstrips with explosives thousands of miles into Russia.” (He seems to have been playing fast and loose with chronology: Ukrainian drones reached hundreds of miles into Russian territory that December; it would take them still longer to reach thousands.) Drone technology has indeed been crucial to the conflict, especially more recently, as troops have been harder to come by on both sides. But a range of commentators have cautioned against assuming it therefore represents “the future of war.” Prominent defense think tanks like RUSI have warned that “overreliance on uncrewed aerial systems” has created “significant problems” for Ukraine, in part because it “plays into Russia’s strengths” at short-range air defense and other antidrone capabilities. William LaPlante, Biden’s under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, has echoed this view. “Don’t tell me it’s got AI and quantum in it. I don’t care,” he said at a 2022 conference. “The tech bros aren’t helping us too much in Ukraine…. It’s hardcore production of really serious weaponry. That’s what matters.” (Many drone companies, moreover, still rely on Chinese parts.) The subtext behind the flurry of puff pieces treating drone war as an inevitability is that a trough of money in the small-to-midsize drone market is up for grabs, over which various coalitions are starting to compete. Sean Gallup/Getty Images A soldier in a US Army platoon specializing in unmanned aircraft systems watches an Anduril Ghost-X drone landing during an exercise at the Hohenfels Training Area, Bavaria, February 3, 2025 To the extent that drones have proven essential in Ukraine, for that matter, hardware made in the US—by firms like Microsoft, Skydio, AeroVironment, and Cyberlux—has fallen short of expectations. Ukrainians have found US-produced drones “fragile and unable to overcome Russian jamming and GPS blackout technology,” The Wall Street Journal reported last year. “At times, they couldn’t take off, complete missions or return home.” Skydio recently announced that one of its controllers was vulnerable to radio interference. The trend of connecting more devices together to create an “Internet of things” often creates new vulnerabilities in turn. Anduril’s output is no exception. The defense blogger who writes under the name Secretary of Defense Rock observed in one widely shared piece that the company’s products “often amount to little more than rebranding existing technologies with a Silicon Valley gloss.” One of their much-touted anti-drone interceptors, the essay suggests, has “the same core function” as a familiar Raytheon product, “with marginal enhancements, repackaged in a sleeker design and infused with branding language that flatters venture capital expectations more than it reflects operational novelty.” Anduril continues to contend both with high costs and with certain problems in the field: “During an exercise last year in the Pacific called Project Kahuna,” according to the Journal, “drones from different manufacturers connected by Anduril’s software struggled at times to coordinate and perform tasks when out of sight from the operator.” Last month, Reuters has reported, the Army’s chief technology officer circulated a memo identifying a “very high risk” factor in Anduril’s prototype for a “next generation command and control” battlefield communications network: “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure.” None of this should be surprising. Anduril is making moves to scale up production, claiming that it plans to open a “hyperscale manufacturing facility” in Ohio next year—but VC–funded firms don’t usually have the incentives or structure to prioritize taking on high-risk hardware projects. Often such companies focus instead on acquiring other firms in areas they’d like to enter, whose “founders” and engineers tend to quickly depart. They often make cuts for “efficiency” that produce an attractive financial picture in the short term, but damage the company in the long run. “The primary product of the defense VC strategy,” the scholar Elke Schwarz has written in a recent article, “is not a defense technology as such, but financial returns achieved through growth.” Worse still, she notes, venture capital’s “mandate for hypergrowth” means that VC-funded companies feel even more pressure than regular ones to produce exponential profits; when those companies make defense products, investors stand to reap enormous windfalls if armed conflict escalates around the world. “To get the military-industrial sector to grow fast,” Schwarz writes, “perhaps the best catalyst is war, or at least the embrace of its possibility.” Indeed, in 2023 a representative of America’s Frontier Fund, a VC firm backed by Thiel and Schmidt, told investors that if “the China/Taiwan situation happens,” or more generally “if there is a kinetic event in the Pacific,” then the fund’s investments would go up ten times “overnight.” 5. Resisting the defense-tech sector’s great man theory of history has grown all the more urgent now, as the Trump administration seems intent on placing those “great men” at the helm of the national security state and entrusting them with reindustrializing the sectors attached to it. Michael Obadal, the former Anduril senior director who is now Army under secretary, is part of a large cohort of Silicon Valley–adjacent figures in the administration: Dan Driscoll, a onetime J.D. Vance adviser with a background in private equity and venture capital, was confirmed as Army secretary13; Steve Feinberg, founder of the notorious private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which in recent years has invested heavily in defense tech, is in as deputy secretary at the Department of Defense, where he is using his experience to “restructure” the Pentagon; the retired general and venture capitalist Dan Kaine is now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Office of Science and Technology Policy is now headed by Peter Thiel’s former chief of staff; and the assistant secretary of defense for critical technologies is now Michael Dodd, also known as “the Doddfather,” an alumnus of DIU. At least until the administration’s recent announcement that it is seeking an equity stake in Lockheed Martin, the primes appeared mostly sanguine about their aspiring competitors. Congress—which tech-defense firms spend millions lobbying14—writes the yearly defense budget, and primes have historically wielded considerable power there; they still receive the bulk of defense spending. Among the legacy firms the prevailing consensus has been that the upstarts will not be able to replace them: their products, after all, are already battle tested. Even so, the defense-tech contracts are pouring in. The Golden Dome missile defense program—a $175 billion-plus redux of Israel’s Iron Dome and Reagan’s Star Wars missile defense program, which experts call just as unfeasible as it was in the Eighties—seems to be shaping up as a cash giveaway to the tech-defense right; a joint bid from SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir is reportedly the front-runner for the contract. (Hegseth has ordered major cuts at the Pentagon testing and evaluation office that a congressional panel recently tasked with assessing the program.) Other start-ups hope to privatize hardware testing, and Palantir seems to be positioning itself to assume some of the same functions of the embattled National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. New Pentagon rules that facilitate “anything-as-a-service” contracting allow private companies to shut off or modify their products as they desire (within contractual constraints, assuming these are followed), making US arms exports considerably less appealing to other countries but allowing the companies veto power over the use of their services or weapons—and further opportunities for rent-seeking. This past May, Luckey announced that Anduril would, as 60 Minutes put it, surpass “$6 billion in government contracts worldwide” by the end of the year. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said at a recent White House AI summit, calling out Sankar by name. Scott Legato for Palantir Technologies/Getty Images Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar giving a keynote speech at the Inaugural Reindustrialize Conference in front of a projection of Intel cofounder Robert Noyce, Detroit, Michigan, June 26, 2024 Defense-tech executives clearly hope to take advantage of the post-Covid surge of interest in industrial policy. There has been a great deal of chatter in right-wing circles, from Oren Cass’s American Compass to the Heritage Foundation, about the prospect that the US could move from a supposedly feminized service-based economy to a masculine-coded, producerist one organized around defense manufacturing. (In April, Fox News ran the chyron “TRUMP’S MANLY TARIFFS: PUNDIT BELIEVES IT COULD REVERSE CRISIS IN MASCULINITY.”) Even institutions like the American Enterprise Institute, which have historically reviled industrial policy in any form, have jumped on board, publishing papers endorsing industrial policies of different kinds tied to “national security.” Palantir’s leaders have echoed this rhetoric for their own purposes: Sankar lamented on The Merge that the best minds have gone into fields like ad-tech rather than defense engineering; Karp has declared that US industry has degenerated in the past fifty years to focus on “the consumer market” rather than using technology to “address challenges of industrial and national significance.” Trump himself seems to alternately contradict and endorse this agenda. He has been especially critical of CHIPS, accusing it of offering companies money they didn’t need and requiring them to hire “woke people” that hampered their success; at a recent AI summit he encouraged “all American companies to join us in rejecting poisonous Marxism in our technology.” It is as if he thinks that chip manufacturing can be brought back to the US through permitting reform and tariffs alone. Appalling immigration raids like the recent one on a Hyundai factory in Georgia have conflicted with the administration’s aim to learn from foreign expertise, producing extreme international backlash. Most recently, under Feinberg’s aegis at the DoD, the administration has pioneered an entirely new form of statecraft: running the Pentagon like a private equity firm. In the past two months the government has made a slew of one-off deals with companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and a rare earth mineral company called MP Materials. At the center of some of these agreements is a novel reading of the Defense Production Act, which the Senate Armed Services Committee is trying to formalize via a new provision allowing the government to make equity purchases in private firms. The provision has yet to pass—which has not stopped the administration from going ahead anyway. The MP Materials agreement is instructive. Feinberg, no stranger to investing in the defense world, reportedly negotiated the deal, which includes a provision to buy magnets from the company despite the fact that they only started manufacturing magnets last year. By offering a price floor and production guarantees, the Department of Defense made it possible for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to finance the issuance of equity in the firm—at which point, seemingly for the first time in US history, the DoD itself bought enough equity to become the company’s largest single shareholder and provided a $150 million loan for the company’s California mine.15 Each of these deals works a bit differently. CHIPS had promised Intel $11 billion on the condition that it met certain milestones, including building an arguably unnecessary Ohio megafactory; when the firm appeared unlikely to meet those conditions, the Trump administration exchanged the remaining money for roughly 10 percent equity in the company. With AMD and NVIDIA, the mechanism looked more like a straightforward shakedown: Trump announced that if NVIDIA wants to continue selling AI chips to China, it has to fork over 15 percent of the profits. These moves hardly amount to a real industrial strategy. One-off coercive deals with individual companies already seem unlikely to reindustrialize the country, and it remains unclear what the administration will do with its new assets. But that outcome seems even less plausible as the Trump administration takes a sledgehammer to the government’s capacity, oversight, and industrial policy. In a mere nine months the administration has destroyed the infrastructure of research and development on which the semiconductor industry and many others rely; done its best to “get rid of” the “horrible, horrible” CHIPS Act, including the new research infrastructure it created; threatened to arbitrarily revoke awards and enacted swiftly changing tariffs that damage industries; behaved so erratically toward the US’s longtime allies that the EU and others have started looking elsewhere to buy weapons; erased the nonpartisan image on which the military depends for its continued funding and ability to operate; decimated the Pentagon’s civilian staff; devastated green industries while simultaneously promising to drive the price of oil so far down that the industry believes it will cause significant bankruptcies; and curtailed the Department of Defense’s product testing, among much else. None of the defense-tech firms that praise industrial policy in theory have launched any serious public protest against these decisions. The more contracts they get, meanwhile, the more government resources they will siphon away from investing in fields—like climate technologies, welfare, or alternatives to plastics—that would benefit the US’s economy or security. Bigger tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Google have, for their part, also moved much closer to the Trump administration. They seem indifferent about the destruction of the infrastructures of research and support upon which they previously relied, perhaps because they believe they can hire researchers on a mercenary basis, outsource research and development to AI, or replace government functions with private ones—a doubtful prospect, since the government’s function as a neutral evaluator and standard-setter seems impossible to replace.16 The practical problem with this vision, to say nothing of its moral and ethical failings, is that it can only deal with the short term. “We love disruption,” Karp said during the company’s quarterly earnings call in February. “Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working. There will be ups and downs. There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off. We’re expecting to see really unexpected things and to win.” Tech companies and venture-capital firms have become experts at leveraging this sort of “disruption” to generate value for their shareholders on the basis of imagined future profits, and firms like Palantir and Anduril are no exception. But now they have become so voracious, so all-consuming, that they are putting the country’s productive industries at risk. In the process, they threaten to destroy not just the source of their own profits but the spending and investment that lie at the foundation of the US economy.

The scheme comes after a set of passive launches earlier in the year. With this fund, the asset manager enters the well-established flexi-cap category which already has 40+ options and manages nearly ₹5 lakh crore in assets. JioBlackRock fund’s distinct proposition is that it will be managed using a rules-based, technology-led approach rather than a purely discretionary style. At the core of the design is BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) framework. It combines human expertise with data-driven models and draws from a wide universe of about 750 Indian stocks, narrowed down from more than 1,000 using liquidity, turnover, and execution feasibility filters. Each stock is scored on the basis of signals (over 400 of them specific to India) covering fundamentals, market behaviour, and alternative data. The models appear to be refreshed weekly. A benchmark-aware risk process is meant to keep deviations controlled vis-a-vis Nifty 500 Total Return Index whose current top holdings include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, TCS and SBI. The fund’s aim will be to deliver consistent long-term alpha while managing volatility. For perspective, flexi-cap funds as a category have a three-year monthly standard deviation of 3.7 per cent and a Sortino ratio of 0.25, according to ACEMF. The technology backbone is BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, which is widely used by global institutions for portfolio risk analytics, transaction cost modelling, and compliance. In principle, this could provide the fund managers with an advantage in managing costs and risks at scale. Another selling point is that a systematic approach can reduce behavioural biases that affect human decision-making, such as overconfidence or recency. On the investor-facing side, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund has several interesting features. It has no exit load, unlike many equity funds that impose a fee for exits within a year (0.10-1 per cent). The indicative total expense ratio for the direct plan is 0.5 per cent, placing it in the 1st quartile (lowest cost group) basis direct plan offerings. Fund managers Tanvi Kacheria and Sahil Chaudhary bring experience in quantitative and index portfolio management. India’s equity market has expanded significantly in recent years, with higher trading volumes, broader sector representation, and more IPOs adding to the listed universe. A larger opportunity set makes systematic strategies easier to apply. That said, the gaps are clear. As an NFO, there is no live performance record. The back-tested numbers shown in the presentation are hypothetical and cannot substitute for real-world data. Investors should also be aware that regular rebalancing, while intended to capture opportunities quickly, could increase churn and costs if not managed tightly. Flexi-cap funds are designed to provide long-term growth by giving managers the freedom to invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks without restriction. They can suit investors who want equity exposure but prefer to leave the market-cap allocation decisions to professionals. The flexi-cap space already has proven schemes with long track records. On average, existing actively managed funds in the category have delivered about 16.9 per cent CAGR over three years and 20.9 per cent over five years, broadly in line with the Nifty 500 TRI’s returns of 16.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent over the same periods. Fund portfolios are typically tilted towards large-caps (57 per cent), with decent allocations to mid-caps (20 per cent) and small-caps (17 per cent). Investors will need to weigh whether an untested quant-driven offering is worth adding alongside established names. Overall, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund represents an ambitious attempt to bring systematic active investing into India’s retail mutual fund space. Its differentiators are breadth of stock coverage, use of alternative data and AI, governance filters, and lower cost. The risks are the lack of a live record and dependence on models that may behave differently in stressed conditions. Also, small bets across a large number of stocks to beat Nifty 500 may result in a very diffused portfolio. For investors seeking core flexi-cap exposure, established funds remain more reliable choices. JioBlackRock Flexi Cap may be tracked as an option for satellite allocation once it builds a live record. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings’ current preferred choices include HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, and Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.

The ESB said that there were thousands without power across the island at the height of the storm’s impact. That number had fallen significantly by midday on Saturday, with 49,000 without power, mostly in the northwest. An ESB spokesman said it could be early next week before all customers have their power restored. The ESB said the worst affected areas were in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon, Galway and Mayo. “We expect to continue to make significant progress and believe that the majority of customers who do not have their supply restored today will have power restored by tomorrow night. “However, some customers in the worst affected areas may be without power into the early part of next week. “This is likely to include some customers in Donegal, which saw the highest wind speeds recorded during Storm Amy, and in areas across the north-west.” A car in a flooded carpark in Galway on Friday.

Title: As stock market booms, Americans have more at stake than ever
URL: https://www.inquirer.com/business/stock-market-economy-investors-ai-wall-street-20251004.html
Time Published: 2025-10-04T09:13:40Z
Full Content:
Small investors are riding a wave, even as Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture and some analysts think the market is overheated. Americans have a greater share of their resources in the stock market than ever before, driving a historic accumulation of wealth that also leaves more individual investors exposed to the market’s ups and downs. That expansion comes as stocks march steadily upward in defiance of increasingly worrisome economic data. The S&P 500 index rose about 7% in the third quarter that ended Tuesday, led by artificial-intelligence-related investments that some believe are primed for a correction. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that households and nonprofits were investing about 45.4% of their assets in corporate equities as of the second quarter of 2025 — the highest exposure to stocks ever. An estimated 62% of Americans own stock as of May, matching 2024 and the highest level since 2007, according to the polling firm Gallup. And Federal Reserve data analyzed by the Securities and Exchange Commission shows the median U.S. household had about $52,000 in stock holdings as of 2022, compared with nearly $46,000 in 2019. Analysts say there are myriad reasons for this trend line; trading apps such as Robinhood and Webull have made it easier to invest small amounts of money in companies and index funds. It also explains the rise in meme stocks — shares of a company that go viral by way of social media sites such as Reddit. The expansion of 401(k) accounts, spurred by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, means more workers are automatically enrolled in retirement plans that include stocks and bonds. The stock surge has created an influx of millionaires, according to Fidelity Investments, one of the largest administrators of workplace retirement plans. Fidelity had 595,000 accounts with balances in excess of $1 million at the end of the second quarter, up nearly 20% year over year. Personal finance experts also point to the role of emotions in setting investment trends. The spectacular stock market gains of 2020 and 2021 have also led to a sense of FOMO — fear of missing out — as people want to position themselves for the next rally, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. “We’ve also enjoyed a fairly strong economy for a decade-plus, and economic expansion tends to give households more leeway in their budgets to invest for the long term, and more confidence to do so,” Benz said. Meanwhile, Wall Street looked past the looming government shutdown on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing out the last day of the third quarter with a 0.4% gain; the index is now up 13.7% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 9% since the start of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has soared 17.3%. And the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies is up 9.3% for the year. The third quarter has historically been “the most challenging quarter of the year,” notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall, who closely tracks the stock market’s historic performance. October, by comparison, has been associated with a number of volatile “shakeout events,” Stovall said, possibly because it coincides with the end of the fiscal year for many mutual funds, meaning fund managers often adjust their portfolios. Historically, “there is more rain in September, but more wind in October,” Stovall said. Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture. Inflation ticked up to 2.9% in August to the fastest pace since January, fueling stagflation worries. Though unemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, U.S. employers created far fewer positions during much of 2024 and the early part of 2025 than previously reported, according to recent federal data. Analysts say the most recent market gains got a nudge from the Federal Reserve, which lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter-point on Sept. 17, citing a cooling labor market. That should mean lower borrowing costs for Americans looking to buy homes or wanting to start or grow businesses. Falling rates could help companies reduce debt or invest more in their operations. But any development that affects the Fed’s plans — such as an unexpectedly high inflation reading or new tariffs — could spook the markets, said Michael Farr, an analyst with the D.C.-based Farr, Miller & Washington. “What happens if tariff inflation shows up and the Fed says, ‘Wait a minute’? We’re already moving into the thin branches of risk, solely based on these price levels,” Farr said. As a result, Farr said, investing in 2025 is “anything but a no-brainer,” because buying into the stock market means paying for stocks at near-record prices. “Stock ownership means that you own a small piece of corporate America,” Farr said. “While you never want to bet against corporate America, you never want to pay the highest price anyone has ever paid.” The market has been buoyed by continued enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, with big tech companies including Oracle, Palantir, and Meta driving a significant share of the market’s gains. Investors could be at risk if the new technology fails to deliver returns that are commensurate with the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, energy, and other aspects of AI infrastructure. And some analysts believe AI stocks are overvalued, creating the risk of a bubble. A recent order making it easier for everyday savers to invest retirement funds in alternative assets such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies could further increase risks for investors, said Corey Frayer, of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. Still, analysts cautioned that the most successful investors tend to keep a longtime horizon and avoid overreacting in the short term. “The biggest risk is that, if we have a sell-off, these newer investors could cash out at the bottom,” said Wayne Wicker, president of McLean, Va.-based Opal Capital. “Markets can go a lot further with rich valuations than most people expect.”

Title: ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from Xbox Game Pass' price hike to foldable iPhone teasers

Here's your firmware update for October 4, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week has rounded off September, or Tech-tember as we call it, with the last few events of the month, from Amazon to Google's big hardware and software reveals. We also watched the internet implode as Xbox Game Pass got a major price hike, leading many to question if the subscription is still a good deal for them. To catch up on all of this and more, scroll down for our recap of the week's seven biggest tech news stories. For ICYMI, we don’t normally include reports based on leaks and speculation, as while they can be right on the money, they can also be way off the mark – even from often reliable sources. We’re making an exception here as Samsung Display’s president Lee Cheong has said that the company is preparing to mass produce foldable phone panels for a North American client, and only one company comes to mind as this mysterious buyer: Apple. That’s because the long-awaited foldable iPhone is rumored to be launching next year, and Samsung Display has long been making its other iPhone screens. We’ve heard numerous rumors about what the foldable iPhone might look like, but expect something thin – it might even be thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air when unfolded. Pricing-wise, the most recent leaked price we’ve heard is $1,999 (around £1,500 / AU$3,050). The much-hyped Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are finally available to the public in the US, and you can even book a demo to give them a whirl. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This wearable is essentially Meta’s existing Ray-Ban smart glasses with a screen attached, offering additional functionality such as on-screen navigation, notification pop-ups, and even support for video calls. But with pairs starting at $799, you probably want to try them before you buy them. That’s why, using Meta’s official scheduler page, you can find a retailer near you offering 25-minute demos. Just be prepared to wait a while, as demos are already booked up for months – although as more stores offer the specs and roll them out to more regions, it should become easier to book a demo slot. Tilly Norwood is an AI ‘actress’ from “the world’s first artificial intelligence (AI) talent studio,” Xicoia, and she burst onto the scene via social media to look for agent representation. The creator asked folks to “judge her by merit,” but we and many others – especially notable Hollywood figures – have decided she’s a terrifying prospect for the world of entertainment that could remove humanity from upcoming shows and films. At these times, we can't help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: "I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes." If you use Meta AI’s chatbot on Facebook and Instagram, you might want to reconsider, as beginning December 16, your chats will influence the ads you see – and at the time of writing, you can’t opt out. "For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page. As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots," Meta explained in its announcement. Meta may be a pioneer here, but Google has discussed showing ads in Gemini and its AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search, while Amazon is using conversations with its Rufus AI chatbot for similar purposes. On Tuesday, Amazon held a huge hardware event in New York, and we were right there in the audience, bringing you the full lowdown on every device as it was announced. Some of the highlights included the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which feels just like writing on paper, integrates with OneDrive and Google Docs, new Echo smart speakers and smart displays, three new Fire TVs, and updated Ring cameras and doorbells. Everything is infused with AI courtesy of Alexa+, and we were able to get our hands (and ears) on everything to bring you our first impressions as soon as the presentations were over. Google’s smart home tech is finally set to get the much-anticipated Gemini update, which will bring more conversational interactions, improved assistance for setting up your automations, and better object detection for your smart cameras. Unfortunately, for the best features, you’ll need to start paying for a Google Home Premium subscription – yours for $10 a month or $100 a year (the Standard tier), or $20 a month or $200 a year (the Advanced tier). The good news is you won’t need to upgrade to the new Google Home Speaker (though you can if you want), as the update will be supported by all of Google’s home tech launched in the last decade. Microsoft set the internet on fire by announcing big changes coming to Xbox Game Pass. That is that a top-tier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription now costs $29.99 / £22.99 / AU$35.95. This means that a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – at $359.88 – costs only a little less than an Xbox Series S – with its recently increased $379.99 price. Now, Ultimate does come with some useful benefits. It now includes a Fortnite Crew membership (which nets you skins, 1,000 V-Bucks per month, and the Battle Pass), Ubisoft+ Classics (curated classic Ubisoft games), and shorter wait times and 1440p resolution when streaming. That said, many gamers haven’t taken this news well, with the page players would use to cancel their subscriptions crashing. Yikes! Don’t worry completely about the price rise, as you can still get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99 per month for now – while stock lasts.

Title: Sea views on Dublin Bay’s south side to go if planned flood walls for Dart line are built
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/climate-crisis/2025/10/04/sea-views-on-dublin-bays-south-side-to-go-if-planned-flood-walls-for-dart-line-are-built/

Plans for new flood defences along the Dart line in south Dublin will replace household sea views with concrete walls, residents have learned. They say the plan will also kill off hopes for a long-promised walking and cycling path along Dublin Bay. Irish Rail says the work is vital to protect the rail line from rising sea levels, intensifying storms and heavier rainfall, but local people are appealing for a rethink. “If this goes ahead, there will be a lot of saddened people,” Marie Baker, a Fine Gael councillor for the area said. The new defences would run for 4km from Merrion Gates to Seapoint – one of five stretches of rail line prioritised for works under the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Projects scheme (ECRIPP). [ Rising sea levels, more storm surges and shifting weather patterns put properties at riskOpens in new window ] They would be built of concrete on top of the existing stone walls, adding 1.3 metres to the height on average. Some glass would be installed at stations along the route to preserve views for waiting passengers, but Irish Rail said it was not possible to use it more extensively. “Flood glass, on its own, is unable to withstand the size of wave and storm loads we expect to experience by 2075, for which we are designing these interventions,” a spokeswoman said. Ms Baker said the loss of views was no trivial issue, as the connection with the sea defined the character of the whole area. She said she had suggested installing storm drains and attenuation tanks to quickly drain and hold flood waters, and hoped this might still be considered. “I don’t think people realise the extent of what is planned. We needed better drawings from Irish Rail to show what it looks like now and what it will look like when they do what they’re planning as a comparison. “If you’re sitting on the Dart, you’re not going to see a thing. I’m not denying we need to do something, but we need to look more at this proposal.” Retired architect Michael Collins said the proposal would end hopes of completing the Sutton to Sandycove (StoS) walking and cycling path. The northern half from Sutton to the Dublin Docklands has been completed, but the southern half has not progressed. “StoS would not only provide a tremendous amenity but it would actually solve the flooding problem,” Mr Collins said. He said a continuous promenade on the seaward side of the rail line, bounded by a wall of moderate height and bolstered by rock armour, would block the waves and allow any overtopping to spill on to the path, saving the tracks and the views. [ Areas on Dublin’s northside among most at-risk from ‘extreme coastal events’Opens in new window ] He said the additional cost could be offset by savings from an Eirgrid plan to lay a high voltage cable from Blackrock to Poolbeg, by running it out into the bay and back. “Eirgrid could lay the cable under the promenade, which would cut the length in half and save an awful lot of money,” Mr Collins said. “We have a solution that works for everyone, and it’s very frustrating when agencies don’t work together for the common good.” Irish Rail said flood defences outside the existing walls were considered, but were ruled out because of the expected impact on protected habitats. Special dispensation from Europe would be needed, and this could significantly delay the project, it said. “The works proposed in these areas would not preclude a walk or cycleway seaward of the rail boundary being delivered in future by a body responsible for active travel,” it added. However, it said these too would likely need permission from Europe. ECRIPP is open for public consultation and submissions until October 13th.

Title: Stripe Unveils Stablecoin Issuance Tool With Phantom’s CASH, Expands Into AI Commerce with OpenAI

Editor Crypto Coin Desk, Krisztian Sandor With Open Issuance and AI payment standards, Stripe is doubling down on its bet on the rising role of blockchain and digital agents in payments. Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid’s USDH and MetaMask’s mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin,” Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. “With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy,” Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on “pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream.” Read more: Why Circle and Stripe (And Many Others) Are Launching Their Own Blockchains Crypto Crypto Crypto

Dear friends, Welcome to the October issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. And welcome to the Dog Days of Autumn! The natural world is scrambling to keep up with the changes we’ve triggered, and continue to intensify, upon it. As I walked one of the many bike/hike trails in the Quad Cities on Sunday, I confronted two worlds. One was defined by 90-degree temperatures, hot sunshine, and cracked earth. The other by the rhythm of birds called southward and plants quietening for the season to come, ready for the renewal that heralds the spring. Some plants need the signal of darkness to trigger their autumnal bloom. The mums in our south garden once attended my mum’s funeral; today, they celebrate, triggered by the lengthening night. A sort of “geez, it’s getting dark around here, I better get my butt moving” response. I wonder if we might take inspiration from them? Common milkweed, the Augustana College Quad, late September 2025 Our colleague Lynn Bolin addresses portfolio construction for uncertain times with two complementary October pieces. In “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control,” he presents a ten-fund “all-weather” strategy targeting 8% returns with 12% maximum drawdown, emphasizing Alternative Global Macro, Alternative Multi-Strategy, and globally diversified funds. Drawing on Rob Dix’s The Price of Money and Kenneth Rogoff’s Our Dollar, Your Problem, Bolin argues that Quantitative Easing inflated asset prices, while current high valuations suggest below-average future U.S. stock returns, leading him toward funds like FPA Flexible Fixed Income (FPFIX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX). His companion article, “Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios,” explores hedges against what Dix and Rogoff predict will be “more frequent bouts of inflation” and financial instability. While gold has soared past $3,750, Bolin seeks lower-volatility alternatives, comparing funds like AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) and Frost Credit (FCFAX) against his target portfolio. Though Lynn is not expecting 1970s-style stagflation imminently, he’s adding fifty funds to his evaluation system for potential portfolio modifications, balancing inflation protection with his conservative risk tolerance. Stay tuned! We had an unusual wealth of fund launches to report on, resulting in two Launch Alerts and one not-quite-Launch-Alert. Tweedy, Browne International Insider + Value ETF launched on September 10, 2025. It is active, quantitative, and research-driven. It works from two assumptions, which are corroborated by a lot of evidence. You should: If the folks in the know are pouring money into stocks you’ve identified as undervalued, that’s a powerful confirmation. It has worked well with its sibling, Tweedy, Browne Insider + Value ETF, which launched in 2024, falls in the mid-cap value box, and is up 23% YTD. RACWI US ETF launched on September 11, 2025, and is Research Affiliates’ permutation of an S&P 500 index fund. Here’s the tweak: RAFI starts with the question, “Should these firms even belong in the investable universe?” They answer that question by looking at corporate fundamentals (do they make money?) and then excluding companies that are failing, without regard to their stock price. Currently, they exclude about 25 of the S&P 500 companies, but then market-cap-weight the remainder just as the S&P does. The Militia Long/Short ETF is the not-quite-a-Launch-Alert. Launch Alerts target funds launched in roughly the past 6-8 weeks, while Militia launched in January 2025. We wanted to put it on your radar because Sam Lee, former Morningstar editor and strategist, founder of SVRN Asset Management, former MFO contributor, and a remarkably smart guy, wanted to put it on ours. Finally, The Shadow reports on the industry’s latest tribulations, including T. Rowe Price’s decision to liquidate its once-promising T. Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund, a bunch of funds deciding they’d rather go to the ETF dance, and Dodge & Cox triggering three sets of share splits. The conversion story took a twist in early October with the SEC’s imminent announcement of a decision to permit ETF share classes of mutual funds. That means that you might be able to choose either the Fidelity Low Priced Stock fund’s no-load retail share class or the same fund’s ETF share class. According to Morningstar, at least 75 fund firms have lined up to create ETF shares of their existing funds, which might well blunt the incentive for the fund-to-ETF conversions that have proliferated in the past year or two. Geoff Colvin, senior editor-at-large at Fortune, made two useful observations in late September: His simple statement that stocks are highly valued is indisputable. Most measures are screaming that the S&P is insanely overpriced. The Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/Earnings ratio is the highest it has been since the dotcom peak. The price-to-sales ratio hit a new all-time high this week. The Buffett Indicator—ratio of the market’s capitalization to GDP—says stocks are highly overvalued, and Warren Buffett is holding an enormous cash cache because he can’t find bargains. But also: Greenspan gave his [Irrational Exuberance] speech in December 1996—almost four years before the market plunge. As he told Fortune years later, “If you had left the market when I gave my irrational exuberance speech, you would have missed another 80% of increase” in stock values. (Actually, it was closer to 100%.) (“Back in the ’90s a Fed chief warned about ‘irrational exuberance’ in the markets. Stocks rose 105% over the next 4 years,” Fortune, 9/30/2025) CNN notes the same anomaly: “Hiring is at a standstill. Inflation is on the rise again. Consumer sentiment is slipping near historic lows. Americans are increasingly fed up with the economy” (“Why are stocks setting records when the economy feels down in the dumps?” CNN, 9/15/2025). Satya Pradhuman, once the chief small cap strategist at Merrill Lynch and now director of research at Cirrus Research, claims that the market is already in crazy-land: “The melt-up of risk-taking in U.S. equities has pierced the upper boundaries of a normalized range. A combination of a very crowded equity market, combined with an extreme risk appetite, places the U.S. equity market into an overtly speculative chapter” (“Stock market’s relentless rally threatens to turn into a ‘melt-up’,” via Dow Jones, 9/13/2025). Quartz reports, “Wall Street’s penny aisle is back in business. More than 90 companies — including a Hong Kong noodle shop and a smattering of obscure startups — have floated IPOs this year at $5 a share, the highest number since the Regan years. Penny stocks’ comeback has less to do with solid fundamentals than it does with commission-free apps that turn speculation into a swipe, crypto-fueled investors chasing the next moonshot, and a regulatory spotlight that has wandered elsewhere. For retail traders shut out of $4 trillion tech titans and six-figure Bitcoin, penny stocks offer a cheap thrill: thousands of shares for less than the price of a single iPhone” (Quartz Daily Brief, 9/25/2025). On the day I write this (a) the federal government shut down, (b) the jobs report from ADP was disastrous, and (c) the stock market went up. The federal response has been “to boldly implement” Trump’s order to get alternative assets into retirement plans (Department of Labor News Release, 9/23/2025), while FINRA moved to relax the rules surrounding day-trading, so both retirement and non-retirement investors can treat their portfolios like a roulette wheel! Whee? The key to all of this is the willingness of the American consumer (aka “you”) to continue having confidence in Mr. Trump’s steady hand on the tiller, which leads you to continue buying more and more stuff, relying on more and more debt (currently a record $18.4 trillion) to do so. And the level of stock ownership is now at a record high; almost 45% of Americans’ net wealth rests in their stock portfolios (Federal Reserve data, 9/28/2025). So the American consumer is propping up the stock market, and the stock market is propping up the economy, and now consumer confidence is cratering. Will there be a devastating market crash? Yep. Soon? Maybe. Maybe not. What’s an investor to do? The same as always, dear friends. Act before the storm, not during it. Find an asset allocation (mine, as readers now, is 25/25/25/25) that will likely produce the returns you need to meet your goals with a level of volatility that allows you to continue enjoying life and sleeping regularly. Our recommendation has always been to look for managers who earn their keep and your trust: they have an enormous dislike of losing your money, they’re fully invested with you, they speak sensibly, and have a record of success across friendly and hostile markets. Do not ever sit at the same table with someone who preens and struts and talks about beating the market; they’re fools and potentially contagious. The goal is not to “beat the market,” it’s to live a good life and then move on. Jonathan Clements, who died this week of cancer at 62, was that rarest of financial journalists: someone the industry couldn’t buy, couldn’t charm, and couldn’t seduce into softening his message. For nearly two decades at The Wall Street Journal and later as founder of Humble Dollar, he wielded his pen like a scalpel, cutting away the jargon, the self-serving studies, and the expensive nonsense that Wall Street had convinced investors was gospel. Jonathan Clements and I corresponded once, around the launch of Humble Dollar. He was amiably cool from my perspective, which I expected and respected. I invited him to add his voice to Mutual Fund Observer when it called to him, but he had other plans and, as it turned out, far greater success. Clements’s prescription was elegant in its simplicity: eliminate human agency wherever possible, invest in broad market index funds, keep costs ruthlessly low, and refuse to believe that anyone, whether broker, advisor, or fund manager, could consistently beat the market. He had the data on his side, the integrity to say it plainly, and the courage to sustain a “nonstop blizzard of complaint and criticism” from an industry that hated what he wrote. MFO pursued a different path. I’ve argued for considering small, boutique managers whose strategies made sense and whose understanding of themselves as “risk managers” rather than “return managers” was deeply ingrained. I believe that thoughtful human judgment, properly applied and fairly compensated, can add value for investors willing to do their homework, most especially in turbulent markets. Jonathan would have seen this as precisely the kind of thinking he spent his career arguing against. And he wouldn’t have been entirely wrong to be skeptical. But here’s what mattered more than our tactical disagreement: we shared an absolute commitment to helping people achieve financial security in the face of forces designed to enrich an industry at the expense of those it claimed to serve. Clements and I arrived at different answers, but we were working on the same problem, and we were both trying to solve it honestly. That honesty was Clements’s defining characteristic. Jason Zweig noted that in over 1,000 columns, Jonathan “never once, to the best of my knowledge, wrote anything that was flagrantly wrong. He never misled or fibbed, or lied to his readers.” In an industry built on obfuscation, that record is astonishing. But what strikes me most, reading the tributes from those who knew him, is how Clements understood that money was never the point. Money was a tool for building relationships, for creating experiences with family and friends, for making a difference, and for achieving peace of mind. He wrote about raising financially responsible children. He mocked the industry’s obsession with accumulating possessions rather than celebrating meaningful experiences (which is not the same as “selfies”). And in his final year, he wrote with grace and humor about his own dying, making space for others to talk about what we’re all moving toward and helping them feel less alone. “To philosophize is to learn to die,” wrote Montaigne (with thanks to Jason Zweig for the reminder of Montaigne’s words). Jonathan Clements spent his career teaching people how to live, how to use money as a means rather than an end, how to see through the fog, how to protect themselves and their families from predation dressed up as advice. And then, at the end, he taught us how to face death with laughter and courage and generosity. The financial services industry will not mourn him. But millions of investors who achieved comfortable retirements because of his clear, consistent, principled guidance will remember him with gratitude. Those of us who disagreed with some of his investment philosophy can still honor the integrity with which he held and expressed it. In a field that rewards complexity, obfuscation, and self-interest, Jonathan Clements chose clarity, honesty, and service. The example matters more than the investment strategy. Rest in peace, Mr. Clements. You fought the good fight. After a small struggle to get their shareholders to endorse or reject a proposal to make AKREX the largest-ever fund-to-ETF conversion. A majority of shareholders finally voted in September to endorse the change. The upcoming benchmarks: October 10, 2025, the retail ARKEX shares merge with the institutional AKRIX ones October 24, AKRIX-the-fund becomes AKRE-the-ETF October 27, ARKE begins trading on the NYSE While Akre shareholders were considering, BlackRock moved to swiftly convert two funds into active ETFs: the BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity Fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity Fund. The new ETF names are iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF (BDYN) and iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF (BDVL). Both are managed by a Global Allocation team headed by the firm’s CIO, Rick Rieder. Both are three-star funds. Since both are part of BlackRock’s “managed portfolio” business, I suspect that the conversion was made to simplify their use for that program. Before signing off and getting back to the work you rely on, we want to take a moment to pause and express our deepest gratitude to the readers who truly keep this project alive: our incredible donors. The messages and the money you send are a profound source of encouragement, and they ensure we can keep the lights on (the server lights in this case). To our bedrock supporters, Greg, William, S & F Advisors, William, Stephen, Wilson, Brian, David, Doug, Altaf: Thank you. We are genuinely humbled by your ongoing commitment. And, to Fred, John, and David who sent donations this month: Thank you for the wonderful lift. Your gifts are an immediate vote of confidence and a powerful reminder that this community is full of people who value the work we do. I’m utterly diffident about encouraging folks to contribute to the Observer when there are so many pressing needs to address: serious, adult journalism is struggling to find readers willing to pay for reliable information, food banks are being drained at an alarming rate, conservation groups are desperately trying to compensate for the insanity that’s gripped the executive branch, and so on. Here’s our recommendation: Go do good. Don’t talk about doing it. Do it. Do something. That has two benefits: (1) it steadies you—action is the antidote to despair—and (2) it helps a beleaguered world. Support your local foodbank Pay for reliable journalism and pay for reliable local journalism Plant a tree (or a seatree) Support climate action near you Volunteer at your library Support independent local booksellers (Bookshop, an Amazon alternative, contributes directly to local bookstores with each book sold) Support a worthy cause, support a worthy candidate.

Title: Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios

Gold is considered one of the best hedges against inflation and uncertainty. Gold fell from about $385 in 1995 to a low of around $250 by 2001, to a high of $1,750 in 2011 before falling to $1060 in 2015. It is now over $3,750. For the past ten years, iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has had a total return of 195% compared to 289% for Vanguard 500 Index ETF (VOO). In this article, I compare funds with lower volatility than stocks and gold to protect from inflation. Preparing for inflation should be part of an overall strategy and not just timing the market when inflation rises. Most of my career was in the precious metals industry on the technical side. It was a stable industry to be in during the financial crisis, but stressful when gold tumbled. Recently, the price of gold has increased significantly due in large part to central banks buying gold, the weaker dollar, geopolitical risk, economic uncertainty, falling interest rates, and inflation. The price of gold and stocks of gold miners have risen so fast, I don’t consider either category appropriate for my conservative, low-turnover portfolio in retirement. Tariffs are making the headlines for increasing inflation. Core inflation has risen from 2.3% in April to 2.9% in August. New tariffs were just added for heavy trucks, drugs, and kitchen cabinets. Economists in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters estimate that headline CPI inflation will begin to fall from third-quarter levels, but the rules keep changing. The Federal Reserve is now lowering short-term rates to stimulate employment at the risk of aggravating inflation. Keep in mind that inflation is the change in price levels, so the increase from tariffs will be a temporary bump in inflation to a “permanently” higher price level. In addition to tariffs, the value of the dollar has fallen by eleven percent this year. As inflation increases, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. The falling value of the dollar raises the price of imports while making U.S. exports less expensive. The falling dollar hurts investments in U.S. held by foreigners who finance part of the national debt. The cost of buying a dollar of earnings of the S&P 500 is now $30 per dollar of earnings. It is known as the price-to-earnings ratio and has doubled since 2010. I recently read The Price of Money by Rob Dix, who suggests that we may be in for a period of higher inflation and lower interest rates. I also finished reading “Our Dollar, Your Problem” by Kenneth Rogoff, in which he expects “a sustained period of global financial volatility marked by higher average real interest rates and inflation and more frequent bouts of debt and financial crises.” The reasons have a lot to do with the burden of rising national debt and how it is financed, along with the decline of the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. I am more concerned about long-term inflation as described by Rob Dix and Kenneth Rogoff; tariffs may play a role. Mr. Dix explained that Quantitative Easing was not highly effective for raising inflation to the Federal Reserve target of 2% initially because the money went into the financial system and largely resulted in inflating asset prices such as stocks. QE was more effective following the COVID recession because it increased the money available to the Treasury to create stimulus for the consumer. Along with disruptions to the supply chain from COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation rose to levels not seen since the 1970s. Figure #1 captures the annual inflation rate of the personal consumption expenditures price index and the Federal Funds rate, which is the rate at which commercial banks lend to other banks overnight. The COVID bear market occurred in 2020, inflation rose dramatically in 2021, and the Federal Funds rate was raised to slow inflation in 2022. My analysis of fund performance in this article focuses to a large extent on 2021. Figure #1: Federal Funds Rate and PCE Year-Over-Year Inflation Source: Author using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. Wolf Richter discusses mortgage rates being between 6% to 7% following a large increase in home prices after the COVID recession in Longer-Term Treasury Yields & Mortgage Rates Jump after Rate Cut, Yield Curve Steepens, Bond Market Gets Edgy on Wolf Street: “But that’s a bubble-pricing problem now that should have never occurred, not a rate problem. The rates are fine. They’re historically at the low end of the normal range. The 5% and below mortgage rates were a creature of massive QE during the Financial Crisis and after, when the Fed loaded up on trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and MBS to push down long-term rates. But the Fed has been doing the opposite since the second half of 2022 and has shed $2.4 trillion of those securities as QT continues.” The Federal Reserve has been gradually unwinding its balance sheet when the economy and markets are strong. I expect the long end of the yield curve to stay higher for longer because of the high national debt, specter of inflation, unwinding of Quantitative Easing, and rising geopolitical risks. Federal Reserve independence is gradually being eroded. The Federal Reserve is lowering short-term rates, and a coordinated effort by the Treasury and Federal Reserve may lower intermediate-term rates. I anticipate that short- and intermediate-term rates will be lower over the next year, but remain higher than they were from 2009 to 2021. Table #1 shows Lipper Categories that have traditionally hedged against inflation, along with those I identified by looking at the recent period of high inflation. They are sorted by a Ranking System composed of my proprietary ranking system, three-month return, return in 2021 when inflation was rising, four-year Martin Ratio for risk-adjusted return, and yield. I have added toggles to my investment system to add or tilt weights for “Tax Efficiency” for after-tax accounts, “Risk Off” for my outlook, and “Yield” if income is an objective. Table #1 is rated for a conservative, tax-advantaged account where I am seeking income. Metrics in the table are shaded red for “worst” and blue for “best”. Table #1: Categories That Did Well During High Inflation – Four-Year Metrics Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, and Morningstar returns as of Sep 26th. The Commodities Precious Metals category did not provide much protection against inflation in 2021, but has performed well since then because of rising rates, falling dollar, and uncertainty. Notice the high maximum drawdowns of Precious Metals Equity, Real Estate, and the S&P500 relative to other categories. Inflation-protected bonds are considered safe protection against inflation. The green shaded categories are the ones that I identified in this month’s companion article, “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. The gold shaded categories are what I consider to be possible lower-risk hedges against inflation; however, commodities can be very volatile, as we will see later. The green shaded funds are the ones that I currently own, and the blue shaded funds are in my Conservative Target Portfolio for future investments. I like the Flexible Portfolio, Alternative Global Macro, and Alternative Multi-Strategy categories, where managers have the discretion to adjust according to market conditions. I used Mutual Fund Observer metrics and Portfolio Visualizer to select the following funds in Table #2 to be added to my watch list for inflation. As a general observation, they either have higher MFO Risk or lower MFO Rating for risk-adjusted returns compared to the funds in “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. Table #2: MFO Metrics for Selected Funds – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. In Table #3, I substituted Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) for Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) in my conservative portfolio from the companion article. This adjusted portfolio has an APR of 9.5% compared to 8.4% for the Conservative Portfolio; however, it also has a higher drawdown of -14.8% compared to -12.4% and the Ulcer Index increases from 2.2 to 2.9. The portfolio continues to have an MFO Risk of “Conservative” (MFO Risk =2). Table #3: MFO Portfolio Modified for More Inflation Protection – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Portfolio Tool. Figure #2 compares Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) to BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). The funds being tested have higher returns and higher volatility than the funds in my target portfolio. Figure #2: Comparison of Total Return for Selected Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. After doing the research for this article, I added around fifty funds to my investment system, which I have not had time to evaluate thoroughly. This is a task for next month to see if I want to modify my Conservative Target Portfolio. When looking to invest in a fund, I generally start with the five funds with the highest rating per Lipper Category from my spreadsheet. In a stagflationary environment like the 1970s, I would want to own a fund that invests in commodities such as the AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX). I don’t expect inflation to reach that extreme in the near term. I prefer the lower volatility of PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). More aggressive investors and those with major concerns over tariffs may prefer ARCNX. Frost Credit (FCFAX) and Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) are both good funds, with FCFAX having higher returns and yield with slightly more risk. I have rungs on my bond ladder maturing next year, and I will continually reevaluate the funds in my Conservative Target Portfolio.

The conversion of Akre Focus Fund into an ETF was authorized by its investors in September and is proceeding apace. Thanks to all who took the time to vote their shares! On October 17, abrdn International Small Cap fund and the $36m abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income fund will become the abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF and the abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF, respectively. The BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF. JPMorgan Unconstrained Debt Fund has been reorganized into the JPMorgan Flexible Debt ETF effective September 26th. Deepwater Beachfront Small Cap ETF is in registration. Joe Robillard will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been disclosed. The ETF will primarily invest in small-cap companies. Hood River Emerging Markets Fund is in registration. Lance R. Cannon, CFA, Rohan B. Kumar, and Ruoshi Qi will be the portfolio managers. Expenses have not been stated. Sterling Capital has registered five new ETFs. Sterling Capital Ultra Short Duration; Short Duration Bond, National Municipal Bond, Multi-Strategy Income, and Equity Premium Income ETFs. Many managers, no expense ratios. The Truth Social American Energy Security ETF, Truth Social American Icons ETF, Truth Social American Next Frontiers ETF, Truth Social American Red State REITs ETF, and Truth Social American Security & Defense ETF are in registration. Matthew Tuttle will be the portfolio manager for each of the funds. Expenses have not been stated. Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF is in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Westwood Enhanced Income Opportunity, Enhanced Multi-Asset Income, and Enhanced Alternative Income ETFs are in registration. Numerous managers; expenses have not been stated as of this filing. Dodge and Cox is forward splitting several of its mutual funds: Balanced, International, and Stock in the amounts eight for one, four for one, and sixteen for one, respectively, at the close of business on October 24. Their reason for the stock split was the following: New mutual funds generally launch with an initial NAV of $10.00 per share. Given their earlier inception dates and asset classes, the NAVs of the Balanced Fund, International Stock Fund, and Stock Fund have grown considerably. We believe the share splits will better align these Funds’ NAVs with the other Dodge & Cox Funds’ NAVs. As of September 27, 2025, the NAV for Balanced is $110.13/share, Stock is $276.70, and International is $64.85. Leuthold Grizzly Short Fund underwent a one-for-four reverse stock split at the close of business on September 22nd, which boosted its per-share NAV from about $5 to about $20. Effective on January 21, 2026, Virtus is eliminating the Class C Shares on virtually all of its funds. Given that “C” shares are and always were a marketing malignancy (“hey, look! There’s no sales load though we do …umm, charge you 1.76% annually forever”), we always celebrate their disappearance. None that we’ve found. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund will be reorganized into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund once it is approved by shareholders. The reorganization will occur sometime during the first quarter of 2026. Quick history: The American Beacon FEAC Floating Rate Income Fund was previously the Sound Point Floating Rate Income Fund until it was acquired by American Beacon. First Eagle Alternative Credit, LLC’s (FEAC) investment advisory agreement ended on June 20, 2025, at which time DoubleLine Capital commenced managing the fund, and the name of the fund was changed to American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund. DoubleLine Income Fund and DoubleLine Infrastructure Income Fund will change their names to DoubleLine Securitized Credit Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund, with predictable rewrites to their prospectuses, on October 28th. The hottest trend in prospectus writing? “The fund may terminate and liquidate at any time without shareholder approval,” a phrase now used by the AIM, Amplify, Collaborative Investments, ETF Opportunities, Innovators, Northern Lights, REX, SCM, Truth Social, and Ultimus ETF trusts, among others. Sub-text: “We’re just tossing s**t against the wall to see what sticks, we got no commitment to any of this stuff and want to be able to flush it as quickly and easily as possible! Welcome aboard!” 2x Daily Software Platform ETF will be liquidated on October 10, 2025. The fund launched on July 1, 2025, and no one, including the managers, cared. September 25, 2025, was a big day for the AXS Real Estate Income ETF! It managed to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and prepare to distribute proceeds to shareholders of record. Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ticker: ELON) will be liquidated on October 10, 2025, because “the Fund could not conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner over the long term due to the Fund’s inability to attract sufficient investment assets to maintain a competitive operating structure.” Here’s the strategy: short Ford, long Tesla, trust Elon. If the Morningstar charting is correct, it seems to have lost 50% in its first two weeks. Apparently, the fund, which launched in mid-February 2025, somehow lost faith and only drew $1.1 million in assets. Per Morningstar, neither of the managers risked their own money on the fund. BlackRock Sustainable High Yield Bond Fund is closing to new purchases on November 12, 2025, and will be liquidated on December 12, 2025. Franklin Sustainable International Equity ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 16, 2026. One-star fund that was wildly successful from 2017-2021 and hasn’t been able to find its butt with both … well, it has trailed 95-100% of its peers over the past 1, 3, and 5 year periods. Harding, Loevner Chinese Equity and Emerging Markets ex China have begun the process of liquidating their assets, which the managers expect to complete by November 19, 2025. Same team, negligible assets. Johnson International Fund, which was launched in 2008, will be liquidated on November 21, 2025. A curious development, really. The fund has had the same manager since inception. He’s been very successful as the lead manager on the Johnson Opportunity Fund, but international has managed to pretty consistently trail 80-100% of its peers and has attracted negligible assets. Kempner Multi-Cap Deep Value fund will be liquidated on or about October 15, 2025. Penn Mutual AM Strategic Income Fund and Penn Mutual AM 1847 Income Fund will cease operations and liquidate on or about November 14, 2025. Themes Airlines ETF and Themes European Luxury ETF closed and liquidated on September 12, 2025. T Rowe Price Global Consumer Fund will be liquidated on November 14, 2025. T Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund will experience liquidation and dissolution on or about January 23, 2026. No reason given, though performance sort of sucks. It’s a Price fund whose five-year records (1.89%) barely exceed its expense ratio (1.19%). The mandate was to outperform cash with low volatility and low correlation to the stock and bond markets. The “edge” was that the managers had immediate and ongoing access to other T Rowe Price managers, which gave them exceptional insights into movements across asset classes. The system may have broken down when Price had an internal restructure, which impeded the managers’ daily strategy pipeline. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 Billion Bet on a Lesser-Known Data Center Firm

(Bloomberg) -- At the start of the year, a lesser-known infrastructure company called Aligned Data Centers managed to pull off a $12 billion fundraise — more than some of the world’s leading artificial intelligence startups have been able to secure in a single round. The goal: dramatically expanding its footprint to support surging demand for the facilities that power AI systems. Nine months later, with much of that build-out still in the works, Aligned is in advanced discussions to be acquired by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners in a $40 billion deal. It’s on pace to be one of the largest transactions of the year and potentially the biggest ever for any data center company. The takeover talks, which Bloomberg News reported late Thursday citing people familiar with the matter, are indicative of just how much money investors are willing to throw at companies viewed as integral for the AI boom. According to a Goldman Sachs report issued Thursday, AI-related companies have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance so far this year, already eclipsing the $127 billion in total debt last year. As tech companies say they’re prepared to spend hundreds of billions, if not trillions, on physical infrastructure for AI, there’s growing demand for firms like Aligned that promise to meet those needs. That’s true even if most of Aligned’s data center capacity – and the revenue expected from it – is still in the planning stages. “They have a lot of planned activity,” Ari Klein, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said about Aligned in particular. “You’re probably seeing companies paying up for that planned activity, or what could come.” Founded in 2013, nearly a decade before the generative AI boom, Aligned has long focused on providing custom data centers for businesses, with an emphasis on efficiency and sustainability. The company is backed by Macquarie Asset Management and has 78 data centers under management or in development across the Americas, according to its website. As with other data center providers, Aligned has come under new pressure to build more and bigger data centers in recent years for AI. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt to speed up its plans to build out 5 gigawatts of data center capacity, or enough to power half of New York City on a hot day. The investment was intended to help Align “seize opportunities driven by the surging demand for AI-ready infrastructure,” said Andrew Schaap, the company’s chief executive officer, in a social media post at the time. “Aligned is ready to meet this moment.” The only challenge is that data centers — and all the infrastructure, including power supplies to support them — take time. Currently, Aligned has just over 600 megawatts of data center capacity that’s live, with another 700 megawatts of capacity under construction, according to DC Byte, a market intelligence firm that tracks the industry. Still, the combined capacity makes Aligned a “decent-sized operation,” according to DC Byte founder Edward Galvin. Coreweave Inc., a cloud provider that has struck deals with OpenAI and Nvidia Corp., has 470 megawatts of live capacity, according to public filings, with much more planned. CoreWeave reported just over $1.91 billion in revenue in 2024. And while Aligned is in talks to sell potentially for $40 billion, Coreweave has a market value of more than $65 billion. Aligned has not publicly disclosed its sales figures. If it charged about $210 per kilowatt per month, the industry standard for data center pricing according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE, Aligned’s annual revenue would be nearly $1.6 billion. That figure would rise to $3.4 billion, including the capacity under construction. Representatives for Aligned did not respond to a request for comment. By comparison, Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust looking to draw data center tenants, saw its market value top $19 billion in its public debut this week. The company, co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, has no revenue – a sign of the frothy market for any business tied to the AI infrastructure boom. On its website, Aligned said its customers have included Nutanix Inc., a cloud software company, Datto, an IT provider, as well as an unnamed government agency and multinational fintech company, among others. Aligned is also developing a new data center in Texas for Lambda Inc., a cloud infrastructure company that’s backed by Nvidia. The data center is still under construction. --With assistance from Olivia Solon. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Carney-championed Net-Zero Banking Alliance shuts down after losing most of its members

Mark Carney makes a keynote address in London in 2020 ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26. Mr. Carney helped establish the Net-Zero Banking Alliance while serving as a UN special envoy on climate action and finance.POOL New/AFP/Getty Images Almost exactly four years after Prime Minister Mark Carney convinced Canada’s largest financial institutions to join a global alliance committed to net-zero emissions related to their lending, the organization is shutting down. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, which Mr. Carney helped to establish in April, 2021, while serving as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, ceased operations Friday after losing most of its membership. Political pressure from Republican lawmakers in the United States led the alliance’s largest American members to abandon the group in late 2024. All of Canada’s largest lenders also bailed earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment. Analysis: Canada’s industrial carbon pricing system is a mess. Here’s how Carney can fix it When the alliance was first established ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union was the sole Canadian member of the group that included 63 financial institutions from 32 countries with US$40-trillion in assets. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada jointly announced plans to join the group in October, 2021. The alliance went on to publish more than a dozen reports that, according to its website, helped almost 150 banks around the world develop climate-related business strategies and set more than 500 sectoral net-zero targets. After a widespread backlash to climate-related corporate initiatives that accelerated after the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump in November, 2024, businesses started a mass exodus from environmentally focused groups. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, the sister organization to the alliance for institutional investors that had more than 325 members managing a combined US$57.5-trillion in assets, also suspended operations in January after its largest member – BlackRock Inc. – decided to leave. Shortly before leaving the alliance, the chief executives of RBC and BMO suggested it was no longer the best mechanism for financial institutions to pursue their climate goals. “If our countries have an objective to get to a certain point, we will be part of that, and therefore pulling out of NZBA hypothetically doesn’t lead to non-commitment to net-zero climate change,” RBC chief executive Dave McKay said at a Jan. 8 conference, one week before the lender left the alliance. “It just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can’t do and how you report, maybe that is not the right mechanism to do it,” he said. Speaking at the same conference, BMO chief executive Darryl White said the bank was still committed to climate transition, but added, “We also have a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers, and we will not abandon that.” “What mechanism you choose to join or bodies that you choose to align with to enforce that – that’s just a pathway,” Mr. White said. “The ultimate goal is unchanged.” Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said the collapse of the alliance highlights the limits of relying on voluntary measures. “While Mark Carney the central banker warned the world of the risk climate change posed to the financial system, Mark Carney the Prime Minister can protect our economy and environment by bringing in rules that force banks to take a longer term perspective and shift investment from fossil fuels to clean energy,” Mr. Stewart said in an e-mail.

Title: Regulators approve disputed $6.2B takeover of Minnesota Power by investment group
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/03/private-equity-utilities-minnesota-power/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T18:06:14Z
Full Content:
By STEVE KARNOWSKI and MARC LEVY, Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group’s takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates. In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility’s owner. Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S. Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn’t affect electric rates. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock. The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department’s attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest. The commission’s chair, Katie Sieben, agreed. “Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said. Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills. Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest. Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval. “Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Roaring Again. Can They Keep Climbing?

Time Published: 2025-10-03T17:57:53Z
Full Content:
Last year's Magnificent 7 tech leaders are rolling again. That hasn't always been the case this year. As a group, the the large-cap technology companies—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—have lagged the broader market for most of 2025. That's led to questions about whether the grouping's reign is over or if its membership should change. Then came September's rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is now up nearly 20% year-to-date, ahead of the S&P 500's close to 15% gain; it more than doubled the benchmark index's performance in the third quarter. The question now: What next? The bullishness hasn't dried up. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said Thursday that growth stocks, particularly those with ties to AI, were supported in the third quarter by strong earnings, expectations of AI-driven growth, and easing interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive. Wall Street analysts largely expect those trends to continue. There's wariness about a bubble in AI; Even Jeff Bezos has suggested that it's in a kind of "industrial bubble" in which it can be difficult for investors to identify the future winners and losers from the field of would-be standouts. Bank of America analysts on Friday said that "every bubble in history popped by central bank tightening, and no central bank in the world has hiked rates in past 2 months." A recent survey of Investopedia readers suggested cooling optimism about the stock market, though they said they remain heavily invested in growth stocks even with valuations at high levels. The Magnificent 7’s resurgence comes on the back of a rebound by tech heavyweights like Tesla and Apple, which had spent most of the year in the red. Their influence within the S&P 500, meanwhile, illustrates the power the group of tech giants have on global markets. The recent performance of some Magnificent 7 stocks highlights the breadth of the enthusiasm. AI darling Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise steadily since April as sales of its chips boomed and trade policy headwinds eased, remains the biggest gainer of the year. But Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's advance in recent weeks after spending a large part of the year in negative territory. Gains for Tesla's stock, which added a third of its value in September, came as worries about CEO Elon Musk's political activities and slumping sales cooled, and bulls shifted their focus toward the electric vehicle maker's advances in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI. Alphabet climbed about 15% in September after a major legal win in which a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser. Apple rose close to 10% after signs of surprisingly strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 and inroads with the Trump administration. All this has many market watchers wondering when the party might end but unwilling to leave just yet. Pictet Asset Management Chief Strategist Luca Paolini on Friday noted the expectation of lower rates and strong corporate profits among reasons to "see upside in equities despite possible impacts of the US government shutdown." Pictet, he wrote, sees "upside in riskier asset classes in the short term." This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent market levels.

Minnesota regulators have approved the takeover of Minnesota Power by an investment group, despite opposition from the state attorney general and consumer advocates MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates. In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner. Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S. Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn't affect electric rates. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock. The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest. The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed. “Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said. Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills. Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest. Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval. “Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans," Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

BlackRock is expanding its membership in the club of AI datacenter investors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another day, another blimp with billions flying the skies of AI. Today's currency transfer comes from BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an investment fund set to write a big check to buy out Aligned Data Centers, a large AI datacenter company. Bloomberg cites sources with knowledge of the deal and pins the amount at a tidy $40 billion. Aligned may not be a household name in tech news, but according to its website, the company has 78 datacenters in locations around the U.S. and South America, totaling 5 GW of processing power capacity across current and future developments. Bloomberg remarks that Aligned got a $12 billion investment in January and was one of the companies that recently met with President Trump about speeding up the country's AI development. Aligned is also attracting attention from investor AGX (backed by Mubadala Investment Co.), which apparently wants to cut a separate deal with the datacenter provider. The report remarks that the deal is set to be inked in a few days, but is not yet finalized. However, it's hard to imagine the agreement being called off in this age, where AI businesses' exponential growth has every investor under the sun tossing money at the prospect of massive short-term lucre. The $40 billion in play makes this deal one of the biggest this year, though it's still early October, and it wouldn't be surprising to see other large bets in short order. Upon completion of the deal, Aligned would be joining CyrusOne in GIP's AI datacenter portfolio. The fund's many-paged checkbook isn't going back in the drawer anytime soon, either; it's reportedly considering buying out power company AES Corp. If this news sounds familiar, it's because it's reminiscent of datacenter provider CoreWeave getting a $6.4 billion infusion from OpenAI just recently. As for Sam Altman's company, it's been cutting deals like crazy, the biggest ones a $300 billion contract with Oracle, and a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia for building 10 GW's worth of datacenters.

Title: Vanguard Rivals Finally Get Hands On Its Tax-Busting Fund Design

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

LawNews PoliticsNews LawCommentary Commentary Health CareNews Health CareCommentary PoliticsNews PoliticsNews SocietyNews InternationalNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews PoliticsSecurityNews PoliticsCommentary PoliticsNews PoliticsNews PoliticsNews Commentary News PoliticsNews International News SocietyNews PoliticsNews SecurityNews PoliticsCommentary Education Analysis SocietyCommentary PoliticsAnalysis Commentary Commentary Commentary Commentary SecurityNews FBI Director Kash Patel (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—The FBI has confirmed that it severed all ties to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left activist group that puts conservatives and Christians on a “hate map” along with Ku Klux Klan chapters. The “hate map” has inspired at least one terrorist attack against a conservative organization. “The Southern Poverty Law Center long ago abandoned civil rights work and turned into a partisan smear machine,” FBI Director Kash Patel told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “Their so-called hate map has been used to defame mainstream Americans and even inspired violence.” “That disgraceful record makes them unfit for any FBI partnership,” Patel added. The FBI confirmed that it has no intelligence products from the SPLC and does not engage in contact or information sharing with the SPLC. The statement comes days after Patel told Fox News Digital that the FBI had severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit that opposes antisemitism but also leans left and condemns critics of transgender ideology. While the SPLC began as a public interest law firm focused on civil rights cases, it gained its reputation by suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy and developed a decades-long relationship with law enforcement combating real hate. After the Klan largely disappeared, the SPLC started targeting mainstream conservative and Christian groups, putting them on a “hate map” alongside Klan chapters. In 2012, a domestic terrorist used the “hate map” to target the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C. He planned to kill everyone in the building. A building manager largely foiled the attack, but suffered lifelong injuries in the process. The SPLC condemned the attack, but kept the council on the “hate map” ever since. The man who opened fire at a Republican practice session for the Congressional Baseball Game in 2017, nearly killing then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, had “liked” the SPLC on Facebook. The SPLC condemned that attack, as well. The SPLC added Turning Point USA to the “hate map” mere months before an assassin with a transgender boyfriend allegedly murdered Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. The SPLC condemned the attack, but has not removed Turning Point USA from the “hate map.” A bureau official told The Daily Signal that the FBI was aware that the “hate map” included Turning Point USA before the shooting. Patel noted that he had previously criticized the SPLC at a panel on anti-Christian bias. “In April, during our Anti-Christian Bias Panel, I made it clear that the FBI will never rely on politicized or agenda-driven intelligence from outside groups—and certainly not from the SPLC,” the FBI director told The Daily Signal. “Under this FBI, all ties with the SPLC have officially been terminated.” At that April event, Patel slammed the FBI under President Joe Biden’s administration, particularly for the notorious memo in which the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office (working with other field offices) urged agents to develop sources inside traditionalist Catholic churches and to target “Radical Traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the SPLC. Critics have long accused the SPLC of being anti-Christian, and the group responded to these claims by noting that it does not put all Christian groups on the “hate map.” For years, the SPLC cited its decision not to put the organization Focus on the Family on the “hate map” as evidence it wasn’t anti-Christian. This year, it added Focus to the map. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pledged that the Justice Department would not partner with groups like the SPLC. The Biden administration reversed that, however. The SPLC has tremendous impact inside and outside of law enforcement. Then-SPLC President Margaret Huang bragged in a 2021 donor meeting that “many agencies in the new Biden administration” reached out to “solicit our expertise” to “help shape the policies that the new administration is adopting to counter the domestic terrorism threat.” That wasn’t hyperbole. The Justice Department received a briefing from the SPLC shortly after it added Moms for Liberty to the “hate map” in June 2023. Big Tech companies like Amazon have used the “hate map” to screen recipients for its former AmazonSmile program, where customers could designate a portion of their purchases go to support certain charities and other nonprofits. Companies like Eventbrite, PayPal, and Hyatt Hotels have relied on the SPLC’s “hate” accusations to decide who they will allow to use their platforms and facilities. Donor networks worth billions have pledged to keep charitable funds from going to SPLC-labeled “hate groups.” The SPLC enjoys this impact despite multiple scandals. The center fired its co-founder and saw its president resign in a 2019 racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal. Amid that scandal, SPLC staff created a union that is part of a union organization that represents the radical anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for Peace. And amid a round of layoffs last year, the SPLC Union accused the center of engaging in “union-busting.” Despite its penurious name, the SPLC has an endowment of more than $700 million, compensates its leaders handsomely, and possesses more than $30 million in offshore accounts, according to IRS filings. Finally, the SPLC has troubling ties to Antifa, the loosely-organized movement of far-left agitators that President Donald Trump recently declared a domestic terrorist group.

Rainx Drive is the Best Cloud Storage Platform Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government.

In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Lenovo LOQ 15 Gen10 review

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model. PC Gamer's got your back Our experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You know what my biggest bugbear is for budget laptops? It's the screen. It is always the screen. For some reason, notebook manufacturers seem to have this almost obsession with pairing massively underwhelming graphics cards with panels that would put most 4K TVs to shame. It's madness. Yes, they might be these phenomenally pixel-dense, OLED, 240 Hz, crystal-clear colour, uber mode displays, capable of projecting the most beautiful, stunning picture you've ever seen in your life directly into your retinas. But as soon as you load up a game and that mobile GPU kicks into life, fans whirring at a million miles a minute, you'll inevitably be graced with the slow chug of growing disappointment, as the approximation of a AAA power-point presentation starts juddering its way across your shiny new device. It's driven me mad for years. That might sound ridiculous, I'll admit that, but I've reviewed a lot of budget laptops in my time that do this, and it's frustrating because it doesn't need to be the case. You gain very little by doing that. Thank the dear and fluffy lord Gabe Newell then (he doesn't have anything to do with this, I don't think, I haven't checked), that Lenovo's LOQ 15 Gen10 ditches that seemingly age-old laptop manufacturer mantra in favor of a more practical GPU and screen pairing instead. At its core, the Gen10 comes complete with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, a Ryzen 7 250, and, more importantly than that, a simple, elegant, beautifully crisp and punchy 15.6-inch, 1920x1080 IPS display, running at around 144 Hz. And it does all of that with a sub $1400 price point. Now, yes, I know what you're thinking, technically, no, that graphics card isn't really a "true" RTX 5060. I mean, it sort of is, so far as the name's the same and the core RTX Blackwell architecture matches it as well, but it's lost about 15% of its CUDA cores, and a not-so-subtle 12% of everything else, (ray tracing cores, ROPs, TMUs, Tensor cores, you know, all the good stuff that makes DLSS 4, kinda, work). Heck, I suppose we should be thankful it still touts that same 8 GB of GDDR7 VRAM. Model No: 15AHP10CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 250GPU: Nvidia RTX 5060 115WRAM: 16 GB DDR5-5600Storage: 512 GB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen Size: 15.6-inch IPSRefresh Rate: 144 HzResolution: 1920 x 1080Battery: 60 WhrDimensions: 15.6 ~ 23.9 mm x 359.9 mm x 258.7 mm | 0.94 x 14.17 x 10.19 inchesWeight: 2.3 kg | 5.07 lbsPrice: $1,389 | £1,300 The good news, though, is that on the whole, that mobile RTX 5060 does actually deliver when it comes to 1080p gaming. Most titles easily averaged well into the 60 fps mark and above, the only exception, of course, being Cyberpunk 2077 without any DLSS support (which still achieved a relatively respectable 36 fps). Chuck on DLSS Quality and the beautiful silky goodness that is MFG, and that too climbs well into the 100s. It's so refreshing to be able to just game at your native resolution on a laptop at this price point, without having to worry about dialling the graphics preset down, or swapping around resolutions and getting stretched pixels or worse. Plus, that 15.6-inch screen is already delivering a pixel density greater than a 32-inch 4K panel does. Alrighty. Stop the press, cancel the review, clearly this is the best gaming laptop of 2025, right? Isn't that right, tiny human? Well, just hang on one minute. It's not all sun-lit uplands and frame rates. We need to talk about the storage and memory setup on this thing. Because, to be blunt. It sucks. In its default configuration, the one I'm testing here, the LOQ 15 comes with a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 at 5,600 MT/s. Do you know what Ryzen loves more than memory frequency? Memory bandwidth. There are times, particularly when loading programs, running multiple applications, or intense, high-load activities, when you almost feel this stuttering effect occur on the Gen10. There's a lag as you attempt to move an application across the screen or open up Task Manager. It's chilling to be blunt, giving Windows Vista vibes, and I don't like it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For an additional $65, Lenovo will pop an extra 16 GB stick in there for you, but to be honest, this should've been two 8GB dual-channel sticks to begin with, retaining that budget price point. At least so you're not left wondering if the whole system's locking up because you just opened Paint, or because your memory setup sucks. Again, on the SSD front, it's similarly just not good enough. The stock model is a SanDisk WD Blue SN5000S, QLC affair, not too dissimilar from the WD Blue SN5000 I reviewed late last year. That's fine, nothing particularly wrong with that for a budget unit. At least, that is, until you see the capacity. It's a 512 GB model, which once Windows is installed, sits at around 370 GB of total available space. I couldn't even install our entire benchmarking suite in one go; it was that small. I had to test games, then delete them and install other games and then test those… Again, Lenovo will happily pop in a 1 TB variant, but for an additional $60 added on to the price tag, which should've been included as standard, given it's a gaming laptop. My list of mild grievances continues with the battery life, which petered out at just 89 minutes. Although that is better than some of the more premium, more power-hungry units out there, the LOQ is generally hampered by its relatively small 60 WHr battery and AMD's relatively power-hungry Ryzen 7 250 CPU. Now, I've been harsh here, I have. This is a budget notebook, effectively. It can't all be brilliant at the end of it all, and there is still a lot to love about it, far beyond that of just the screen being the right pick for that graphics card. CPU performance is impressive, even with that single-channel memory, and it beats out other RTX 5060 notebooks like Gigabyte's Gaming A16 in average fps too, that one in particular featuring an Intel Core i7-13620H (a damning indictment of Intel's currently poor Ultra line gaming performance, it'd seem), which is nothing to sniff at. And the overall build quality of this thing? Purely outstanding. It is a gaming notebook; you can tell that from the get-go, there's no hiding that. There are angles and edges, embossed logos, and a jutting webcam divot, among other things, along with a whole host of I/O ports protruding out of its bottom. But it's not ostentatious. There's a suaveness to it, from the "luna grey" metallic satin finish to the heft and bulk of the thing. It feels solid, yet remains sleek, like it's designed for even the most aggro of esports streamers to wail on after they go 0-3 in competitive. I've played around with laptops four times the cost of this thing that pale in comparison when it comes to the build quality on show here, and that's not nothing. ✅ You don't mind the upgrade path: There's no denying it. The single-channel memory and 512 GB SSD on the base model are massively underwhelming. If you don't mind spending a little extra or can upgrade the two, then the Lenovo LOQ 15 is a fine choice for 1080p gaming. ❌ You're looking for something with a bit more flair: Aside from the above, the LOQ is very much a marmite style. You'll either love how subtle it is for a gaming notebook or despise it. If you're looking for something a little flashier, this ain't it. Cooling is impressive as well, and throughout my time testing, temps rarely got over 70 degrees, even under intense loads. Yes, fan noise is a thing, particularly when it's plugged in, but it's all manageable in Lenovo's Legion app, which, although relatively barebones, does a good enough job of managing noise in exchange for heat, which again you've got a good 20 degrees to play with. There are, of course, your state-mandated AI apps integrated in here as well, requiring Lenovo account sign-up and more, along with the usual intrusive McAfee anti-virus pre-install to be aware of, but from a software perspective, that's about it for bloatware. Elegant. Sophisticated. Well paired. Dialled in to a T. Yet flawed. That is what the LOQ 15 represents. With resplendent gaming performance and a sleek, sharp design that eschews the usual "gamer" nonsense in favor of sophisticated style instead, it's a laptop that checks a lot of boxes. Yet, it's not without fault, and although it entertains well enough, it could've been far, far better if only Lenovo had tweaked that entry-level model's configuration first. Still, for the price, you'd be hard pressed to find an RTX 5060 notebook that packs as much punch as the LOQ 15 does into that price, and for that, I doth my hat to you fine Lenovo, you have done well. Lenovo's hit the mark just right on three things in particular. The graphics card. The screen. The build quality. It's exceptional in those elements and delivers excellent 1080p gaming performance. Sadly, however, due to what are assumedly cost-cutting measures on the RAM and SSD front, it doesn't quite nail the landing with its entry-level model.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is strengthening its alliance with Fujitsu to co-develop full-stack artificial intelligence infrastructure, a move aimed at accelerating enterprise adoption of AI across industries from healthcare to manufacturing and robotics. The collaboration centers on building industry-specific AI agents that continuously learn and adapt, forming what both companies describe as the foundation for the next phase of the AI industrial revolution. The effort will integrate Fujitsu’s Monaka Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) via NVLink Fusion, enabling more specialized systems than general-purpose architectures can provide. Also Read: Nvidia Becomes The $4.5 Trillion Giant Driving AI’s Biggest Deals “Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing where Japan is a global leader. To further support the expanding needs of AI infrastructure, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will expand this partnership in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum,” said Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita. “The AI industrial revolution has begun, and we must build the infrastructure to power it, in Japan and across the globe. Fujitsu is a true pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. Together, NVIDIA and Fujitsu are connecting and extending our ecosystems to forge a powerful partnership for the era of AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang added. Fujitsu framed the collaboration against a backdrop of rising demand for generative AI, where high costs and technical hurdles have kept adoption largely confined to major corporations. The company said the partnership is designed to address those barriers by creating scalable infrastructure that balances performance, security, and enterprise autonomy. The deal comes as Nvidia continues to ride surging demand for its GPUs, which underpin most of the world’s cutting-edge AI systems. The company’s stock has surged 41% year-to-date, far outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index’s 19% gain. Earlier this week, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its central role in the AI boom. Price Action: NVDA stock was trading higher by 0.55% to $189.92 premarket at last check Friday. Read Next: Photo by Evolf via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$124,346.24 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Title: Federal workers share shutdown anxieties and young Trump supporters express frustration: Morning Rundown

Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Furloughed federal workers were already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, then came the government shutdown. Frustrated young Trump supporters express what they want to see out of the president. And, Taylor Swift album drops have always been an event; her 12th one was no different. Here's what to know today. Furloughed federal employees won't be paid until Congress passes legislation to fund the government. And with neither side showing signs of budging as the shutdown enters its third day, some federal employees say they are "sad," "scared" and "afraid." While most of the furloughed employees won't be allowed to work during the shutdown, others who are deemed essential — such as members of the military and airport security screeners — will continue working without pay. Federal workers typically receive back pay once the government reopens, but that requires congressional approval. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In addition to the uncertainty around paychecks, the Trump administration has threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to carry out more mass firings. That's left federal workers, already drained and demoralized by months of layoffs and funding cuts, scrambling to figure out how to cope with the possibility of weeks without pay and a new round of layoffs, according to nearly two dozen federal workers who reached out to NBC News. The wife of a Department of Homeland Security worker in Ohio said that her bank rejected her request for a deferment on her mortgage. Like nearly all federal employees whom NBC News spoke with, she asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, which has publicly fired federal workers it has deemed as being against its agenda. "I was never afraid to speak my mind before, I never felt afraid to talk. Now, people are afraid," an Arizona TSA worker said, explaining her concerns over speaking publicly about how the shutdown is impacting her. She will have to continue working without pay during the shutdown. Read the full story. President Donald Trump's victory last year was fueled in part by young voters. But new focus groups reveal why some young voters who backed his campaign are beginning to sour on his administration's approach to immigration and the economy. Fourteen swing-state Trump voters under age 30 participated in recent focus groups observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 "Deciders" series, produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago. Nine said they disapproved of Trump's overall job performance so far, while five approved. The group included eight self-identified independents and six Republicans. And while some of the voters in the focus groups detailed concerns about Trump, that didn’t necessarily mean they're inclined to support Democrats. Many of them described the Democratic Party as weak and out of touch. Read the full story. Sean "Diddy" Combs apologized and expressed how "sorry" he was "for all of the hurt and pain" he caused in a letter to the judge set to sentence him on two prostitution-related convictions today. Combs, who faces up to 20 years in prison, also asked for mercy, writing he has "been humbled and broken to my core." The letter marks the first time that Combs has addressed U.S. District Court Judge Arun Subramanian in any meaningful way. During the eight-week federal trial, Combs did not testify and gave brief answers to questions from the judge. Read the full story. Taylor Swift has already broken records with her latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," being the most pre-saved album ever on Spotify, making her the first female artist to exceed 100 million album sales. The album features a dozen tracks and reunited her with Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, diverging from her good friend Jack Antonoff, who produced her most recent albums. Fans are also expected to flock to movie theaters this weekend to catch "Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl," which the singer described as a "dazzling soirée." The theatrical event will include the premiere of the music video for "The Fate of Ophelia." Read the latest updates on "The Life of a Showgirl" in our liveblog. Perhaps, nobody knows more about how to sound like Trump than Ryan Chen, a social media star from "CHI-na." Though Chen has never set foot in the U.S., he sounds as American as the president himself, nailing Trump's tone, rambling cadence, and the signature hand gestures. In his first U.S. media interview, Chen told NBC News that he posted his first Trump impression video last fall just as a dare. But the clip went viral. So, he just kept going. Chen's popularity continues to grow at home and abroad even amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, Chen said his videos aren't about politics, and he just wants to make people laugh by introducing Chinese food and culture to foreigners in Trump's accent. – Peter Guo, associate producer Still unsure what's actually worth buying during Prime Big Deal Days?

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and ranking member Richard Durbin have also questioned Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, and Walmart, asking them for details on their hiring and recruitment practices as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees. The senators said their "inquiry" comes at a time when the unemployment rate in America’s tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. According to the Federal Reserve, recent American graduates with STEM degrees now face higher unemployment rates than the general population, they stated. It is pertinent to mention that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been vocal critics of the H-1B visa programme and have consistently contended that these visas are being abused by many to replace US workers with cheaper labour from overseas. In fact, just a few days after their missive to the ten companies, the senators said they are reintroducing bipartisan legislation to "reform and close loopholes" in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act targets fraud and abuse in US immigration system, provides protection for American workers and visa holders and enhances transparency in the foreign worker recruitment process, the two argued. "In evaluating the high unemployment rate for American tech workers, we cannot ignore the massive, ongoing layoffs ordered by you and your peers in Big Tech C-suites over the past few years...At the same time you have been laying off your employees, you have been filing H-1B visa petitions for (thousands of) foreign workers,” the Senators wrote in letters to 10 major employers in the US on September 25, 2025. They added: "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that (you) cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions." On TCS, the statement noted that the company recently announced plans to lay off over 12,000 employees, including American staff. "In fiscal year 2025, TCS applied for and received approval to hire 5,505 foreign H1-1B employees. TCS is currently under investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly firing older American employees in favour of newly hired foreign H-1B visa holders," it said. It further said Cognizant Technology Solutions laid off thousands of workers, including employees in the US. "In fiscal year 2025, Cognizant applied for and received approval to hire 2,493 foreign H-1B employees. In 2024, a federal jury concluded Cognizant favoured South Asian H1-B visa holders over American employees, which warranted punitive damages," it added. E-mails sent to TCS and Cognizant for comments by PTI did not elicit a response. The statement by Grassley and Durbin noted that Amazon laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, blaming the adoption of generative AI tools. In fiscal year 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire 10,044 foreign H-1B employees. Google, it said, laid off tens-of-thousands of employees in recent years, including hundreds of workers in its platform and device unit, and 35 per cent of its small team managers "despite enjoying records profits". In fiscal year 2025, Google applied for and received approval to hire 4,181 foreign H1-B employees, the statement observed. According to it, Meta laid off a quarter of its workforce between 2022 and 2023 and labelled it a "year of efficiency". "In 2025, Meta laid off 3,600 employees, overshooting its stated goal of laying off another five per cent of its workforce. In fiscal year 2025, Meta applied for and received approval to hire 5,123 foreign H-1B employees," it said. Microsoft applied for and received approval to hire 5,189 foreign H1-B employees in fiscal year 2025, as per the statement. Microsoft laid off 16,000 employees this year alone, despite record revenue and profits, it said adding amid criticism for mass-layoffs, Microsoft characterised its actions as an "enigma of success".

Title: How Microsoft Stock Rises 2x To $1,000
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/03/how-microsoft-stock-rises-2x-to-1000/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T10:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. We are fond of companies that generate cash. A lot of cash. What about 2% of market capitalization? Microsoft’s stock is valued at $3.9 trillion and generated $71.6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025, which is about 1.8% of its market capitalization. On a per-share basis, that’s $9.60 of free cash flow for a $520 stock. What’s not to adore? This cash accumulates on the balance sheet, can be reinvested, and fuels buybacks. Microsoft’s operating cash flow margin is at 48.3%, resulting in $136 billion from $282 billion in revenue. Net income? An astonishing $102 billion – a net margin of approximately 36%, marking the inaugural occasion that Microsoft surpassed the $100 billion profit threshold. The balance sheet resembles a fortress, boasting $95 billion in cash compared to $61 billion in debt, indicating a robust net cash position. Simultaneously, Microsoft returned $37 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks within the last twelve months alone. See – Why Microsoft Stock Is A Shareholder’s Paradise? – for additional insights. Although Microsoft stock has experienced a strong year, appreciating by 24% and surpassing the NASDAQ’s 18% gain, the crucial question now is: Is there still room for Microsoft stock to grow? An in-depth examination of the company's fundamentals indicates that the answer is yes, as growth is swiftly accelerating. Microsoft reported impressive results for fiscal year 2025, with revenue and operating income rising in the mid to high teens. A key contributor to this performance is the Intelligent Cloud segment. Azure alone surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, exhibiting remarkable growth of 34% year-over-year. Artificial Intelligence (AI) services are a major tailwind, accounting for 19 percentage points of that growth. The company is sustained by several massive, long-term growth drivers—most notably, the expansion of its AI offerings. These factors are anticipated to drive the stock to significantly higher levels, potentially doubling from its current price to exceed $1,000. We will delve into these specific growth drivers in greater detail. That being said, if you’re looking for upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like Microsoft, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is this the case? The HQ Portfolio stocks as a group have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; showcasing less volatility, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – What’s Next For CoreWeave Stock? Let’s analyze the figures. Microsoft generated $281.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, showing an accelerating growth trend. With AI adoption driving sustained annual revenue growth of 17% and margin expansion through operational leverage, sales could reach $450 billion by 2028. Microsoft’s operating margins are expected to expand to 50% as high-margin AI services scale up and operational efficiency improves. This equates to roughly $225 billion in operating income, or about $180 billion in net income after taxes. With ongoing share repurchases decreasing the float, the share count could trend toward 7.2 billion shares. This would imply an EPS of around $25 per share by 2028. Now, let’s discuss valuation. While Microsoft currently trades at 38 times trailing earnings (based on fiscal 2025 results), its AI monetization narrative justifies a premium valuation. Given Microsoft’s robust growth, superior margins, and strong cash flow generation, we do not expect any significant compression in multiples over the next three years. Despite Microsoft’s promising outlook, potential risks could impede the stock from doubling. The most significant concern is the normalization of AI spending, where businesses may become more cautious about initiating new Azure projects, implying that the current investment pace may not be sustainable indefinitely. Additionally, heightened competition from Google, Amazon, and emerging entities could exert pressure on Microsoft’s AI pricing power and market share growth. See, investing in a single stock without a thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive method to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Microsoft's investment appeal is compelling. Record cash generation of $72 billion and an indomitable balance sheet finance both aggressive AI infrastructure investments and steady shareholder returns, while diverse exposure across cloud, AI, enterprise software, and gaming diminishes risk and positions the company for continued long-term growth. The anticipated $70 billion AI infrastructure investment fosters competitive advantages that enhance market share growth, with additional upside potential arising from AI-driven margin expansion while sustaining accelerating growth. That said, investors should judiciously consider the risks prior to investing in Microsoft.

October 03, 2025 05:52 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Strategic Intelligence - Unmanned Ground Vehicles" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report explores emergent trends within the UGV market, examining use cases and the implementation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensors, and what challenges must be considered in pursuing effective strategies for brand building in this market.UGVs are finally making a mark in modern warfare, and their use can have severe strategic and financial consequences. To overcome developmental hurdles, companies, nations, and militaries are increasingly adopting a collaborative approach. This approach involves public and private investment in the sector and constant experimentation in Ukraine.Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been a distant second thought for those thinking about the future of unmanned warfare. Indeed, Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has demonstrated the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), but until recently, UGVs have rarely been mentioned. Yet warfare drives innovation, and the UGV sector has been developed by Ukrainian fighters seeking to manage personnel shortages. Since the start of that war, the use of UGVs for logistical, engineering, surveillance, and combat support roles has exploded, and Ukraine now plans to deliver 15,000 ground robots for combat use by the end of 2025. While it is important to recognize that UGVs still account for a fraction of the total of unmanned support in conflicts, the utility of UGVs has at long last been exploited by those on the battlefield. Modern UGVs are now suitable for a wide variety of defense and security applications beyond the traditionally limited scope of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), with nations including China, France, India, Russia, the UK, and the US developing logistics, ISR, and combat-capable UGV platforms.To capitalize on the growth of the UGV market, key industry players have been investing heavily in expanding their research, development, and manufacturing capabilities, with both established defense primes like Rheinmetall and KMW as well as emerging players such as EDGE Group engaging in mergers and acquisitions of specialist firms within the UGV supply chain to pre-emptively secure market shares in an emerging capability sector. Firms with expertise in associated technologies such as AI, weapons systems, mobility solutions, and power supply/management will also benefit from growing demand as the diversified applications for UGVs provide new opportunities to engage with primes and forge strategic partnerships to cement their positions within the supply chain.Studies of emerging technological trends and their broader impact on the defense market.Analysis of the various unmanned ground vehicle programs and projects currently under development, as well as the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence on the future outlook of the unmanned ground vehicles theme.Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: Companies Featured For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/3bitvn About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: How posting on TikTok helped this 22-year-old land a software engineering role at Amazon after a yearlong job hunt

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In May, Andrew Chen couldn't stop thinking about the ticking clock. He was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. Then a glimmer of hope landed in his inbox: an email from Amazon inviting him to interview for a software engineering role in 10 days. He knew he couldn't waste the opportunity, so he made a plan: hole up in his room to study — and document his preparation for the big day on TikTok to hold himself accountable. "I canceled all my social obligations, locked myself in my room, and basically only left the house to have lunch," said the 22-year-old. "I was thinking, if I don't get this job, this is all for nothing." Chen is among the many recent college graduates who have struggled to find work. As of June, the most recent data available, 4.8% of Americans ages 22 to 27 with at least a bachelor's degree were unemployed — higher than the 4.0% jobless rate among the broader working-age population, a reversal from the typical trend in recent decades. These challenges reflect a broader hiring slowdown that's hit entry-level job seekers especially hard. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are hiring at one of the slowest paces since 2014. Tech professionals, including computer science graduates like Chen, have been particularly affected, with layoffs at firms including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. On Indeed, US software development job postings have declined by over 70% from their peak in 2022. While some new graduates are still searching, others, like Chen, have used creative job-search and interview preparation strategies to secure offers. We want to hear from job seekers and people who recently landed a job.

You can also find more of our job market coverage below: Chen began looking for a full-time job in the summer of 2024. As a computer science major, he'd always envisioned starting his career in software engineering. But after applying to more than 400 jobs and struggling to gain traction, he expanded his search to include product management and design roles. But he didn't give up on software engineering. Between September 2024 and early February 2025, Chen applied to several software engineering roles at Amazon. In mid-February, he was asked to complete an online assessment for one of the roles he had applied to — he's still unsure exactly which one — that included a coding test and behavioral questions. He thought he had done well — news he excitedly shared with his parents — but as the months passed, he never received an update about his application status. "My parents would keep asking for updates on Amazon because it's a name brand," he said. "And I eventually told them I got rejected — I thought if I hadn't heard from them after months, it's probably not going to happen." By the time Amazon reached out in May, Chen said he was deep in interviews for product management and design roles — and had nearly given up on software engineering entirely. The unexpected opportunity to return to his preferred field was welcome, but its timing posed a challenge. After focusing on other types of roles, he'd largely stopped practicing his coding skills and would need to quickly brush up before the interview. Chen had just 10 days to prepare — and still had to carve out time for interviews with other companies, in addition to school exams and final projects. So he developed a plan of attack, dividing his days into blocks for coding practice on LeetCode, behavioral prep, and studying for other interviews. He set out to read everything he could on platforms like Reddit and Blind about Amazon's interview process and past candidates' experiences, practice common technical questions, study the company's leadership principles, and memorize STAR-format personal stories that illustrated how he embodied those values. "This was the first big company that had given me a chance in a while," he said, "so I really wanted to get this one." But pulling this all off seemed daunting, and Chen felt he needed something to help him stay motivated. Then he had an idea. He'd been interested in creating social media content for a while but had only posted a handful of TikToks. What if he started documenting his preparation for the Amazon interview? Sharing updates publicly on TikTok, he figured, would add the kind of pressure he needed to stay locked in — and maybe even attract advice from others who'd been through the process. On May 19, Chen posted a TikTok with the caption "10 days until FAANG final interview," sharing how much prep he'd done, how many classes he'd skipped, how much caffeine he'd consumed, and how many showers he'd taken. He followed it with similar updates in the days that followed. Chen said his videos — which received as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions, including skepticism that he could land the role given his limited preparation time. "The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement," he said. When interview day arrived in late May, Chen was anxious and sleep-deprived. He said his Amazon "loop" interview process consisted of three back-to-back virtual interviews with short breaks in between. The first round focused on technical questions, the second on behavioral scenarios tied to Amazon's leadership principles, and the third included a mix of both. "I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed," he said. Chen gradually settled in as the day went on and left the interviews feeling like he'd done his best. On June 3, shortly after finishing his third interview of the day for non-Amazon roles, he saw an email notification on his phone. He'd received an offer from Amazon with a six-figure salary. On June 5, Chen posted a TikTok with the news that received over 941,000 views. He graduated in mid-June and, after moving to New York City, started working full-time in July. Chen said his biggest takeaway from the Amazon interviews was the company's emphasis on behavioral questions tied to its leadership principles — something he felt played to his strengths. "They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise," he said. "I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that." One of his top pieces of advice for job seekers: while application quality matters, volume is essential in a tough market. "Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game," he said. "You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for." Jump to

This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships.

This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. Obsolete does not mean useless. Machines that are not state of the art still work and can perform functions that do not require the latest and greatest hardware. However, in a hyper competitive environment, everyone naturally wants to be at the cutting edge. Obsolete means useless as debt collateral, since the asset loses much of its value. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population. Karma when the bubble bursts? Computers are supposed to compute. That is their utility 2+2=4,every time maybe boring, but that is all there is. Your email address will not be published.

According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk. An OpenAI co-founder, Musk has sued the company on multiple occasions. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission and allegedly attempting to steal xAI data and trade secrets.

Title: OpenAI now worth $500 billion, possibly making it the world's most valuable startup

OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity.

ChatGPT is currently losing between $13 million and $23 million per day, depending on how costs are calculated, reflecting operating losses of roughly $400 million to $700 million per month in the second half of 2025. These figures are from several financial reports and news articles published just recently. OpenAI disclosed to shareholders and international media that it lost $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025, mostly due to R&D and operational costs for running ChatGPT on a global scale. This equates to approximately $400 million per month, or about $13 million per day, with other estimates for ongoing all-in costs reaching higher daily figures based on infrastructure, energy, and training expenditures. ChatGPT's unveiling of version 5 was a serious flop, and many users reverted to older models. The new model design and infrastructure changes obviously reflect an attempt to balance costs but at the expense of 'intelligence'. Claude by Anthropic is now preferred by most serious users, and Perplexity is favored for research. ChatGPT's research now lacks the depth, scope, and accuracy of its competitors by a significant margin. OpenAI on a standalone business basis might not be that valuable, but it turns out they have a vast amount of business partnership opportunities, $synergies which are highly unique and thus in the minds of many highly knowledgeable investors, justifying the $valuation Only time will tell, but their chances seem solid, as their scale and biz model flexibility in AI is hard to $achieve Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Buffett's Berkshire Buys; Fair Isaac Soars, Equifax Falls

Shares of a data analytics firm took off after the company said it would provide its consumer credit scores directly to firms that give credit reports to mortgage lenders. The move pressured the credit bureaus that also evaluate potential borrowers. Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher Thursday. Outperformance from materials and technology stocks offset declines in most sectors as investors continued to weigh the implications of a government shutdown. The S&P 500 added less than 0.1%, while the Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. See here to read Investopedia's full coverage of the day's trading. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) confirmed a nearly $10 billion deal to acquire the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum (OXY). The transaction marks Berkshire's largest deal since 2022. Shares of Occidental Petroleum fell 7.3%, while Berkshire Hathaway shares posted fractional losses. Fair Isaac (FICO) shares surged 18%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500, after the data analytics company said it would offer its FICO consumer credit scores directly to firms that sell consolidated credit reports to mortgage providers. The data provider said the move would reduce the reliance on the three nationwide credit bureaus, and shares of the credit bureaus moved lower. Equifax (EFX) shares were down 8.5%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock, while TransUnion (TRU) shares dropped nearly 11%. The prices of bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other major cryptocurrencies extended their recent revival. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. crypto exchange, jumped 7.5%, while of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (HOOD), which also offers crypto trading, added 4.1%. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev at a conference predicted that the "tokenization" of real-world assets, including stocks, would have a major impact on global financial markets. Intel (INTC) shares gained 3.8% in the wake of recent reports that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in early talks to become a customer of Intel's foundry business. Intel stock has doubled in value since reaching its year-to-date low in April, boosted by a series of high-profile investments from Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank (SFTBY), and the U.S. government. Shares of the renewable energy provider AES Corp. (AES) sank 7%. The downturn reversed some of the gains posted in the previous session amid reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by BlackRock (BLK), was in advanced negotiations about a potential acquisition of AES, which has signed deals with several tech firms to power artificial intelligence data centers.

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers.

By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution. KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain.

Title: Meta gives advertisers new AI personalization tools - while using your chats to target content
URL: https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-gives-advertisers-new-ai-personalization-tools-while-using-your-chats-to-target-content/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T19:20:55Z

Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. Meta is continuing to build AI for advertisers. Its latest AI agent and several new tools are designed to serve as an automated online sales assistant and personalization feature for small- to medium-sized businesses, even outside of Facebook and other Meta platforms. Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude At the same time, the company will start using your chats with Meta AI to personalize the ads you see on Meta platforms. The company's new Business AI agent can provide online shoppers with basic customer support and product recommendations on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. The goal is to quicken the process between customers discovering a new product and completing a purchase, while simultaneously freeing businesses up to focus their attention on more pressing tasks. Leading tech companies have been investing heavily in business-facing AI agents, promoting them as a simple and effective way to automate busywork. Like many other agents, Business AI specializes in analyzing and integrating with the context of the business deploying it; the system automatically assesses a brand's preexisting online presence to modify its outputs. Also: How autonomous businesses succeed by engaging with the world Eligible businesses can now access Meta's new agent for free via Meta Ads. It's also available "at a fraction of the cost of other solutions," Meta wrote in a company blog post, for businesses based in the US that want to add it to their website, or to their WhatsApp and Messenger accounts, with availability in more countries expected soon. (A company spokesperson declined to provide additional details around the agent's pricing structure.) Alongside this product release, Meta had some news about its user experience and personalization policy. Starting Dec. 16, the company will begin using individual users' interactions with its Meta AI chatbot to customize the ads and content recommendations they see on Facebook and Instagram, the company announced Wednesday. Someone asking one of Meta's chatbots about local dining options, for example, might start seeing ads for nearby restaurants on Meta platforms. There's no opt-out option for the new personalization changes, Meta said in its announcement. You always have the option of not interacting with the company's chatbots while using its apps, of course, but the company is also reportedly working on chatbots that proactively strike up a conversation with users. Also: My new favorite Photoshop AI tool lets me combine images in one click - and I can't stop Some conversation topics won't be included as training data, including anything that covers sexual orientation, health, race, religion, or political views. Chats that take place before Dec. 16 also won't be used, and the personalization changes will not initially apply to users in the UK, South Korea, or the European Union, a Meta spokesperson confirmed to ZDNET. While Meta said it won't start using chat data for targeting ads until Dec. 16, it's hard not to see a relationship between the company's increased in-house personalization via AI and the launch of external AI personalization tools for businesses. It's unclear what the relationship will be between user chat data and the models powering external tools for advertisers. Meta also announced Thursday that it was launching more AI tools to help businesses create ads on Advantage+, its AI-powered social media ad campaign management platform. There's a new AI-generated music feature, for example, which, according to Meta, "understands the content of an ad and produces unique, custom music that reflects the product, style, and sentiment -- helping brands better engage their audiences and connect in new ways." Also: Meta wants AI to automate every step of the ad production process - report The company also introduced AI dubbing for quick translation to reach international audiences, a tool for generating higher-quality AI-generated videos in ads, and another that generates a set of images curated to different audience demographics. The new features build on a broader offering of generative AI tools for advertisers, which Meta first began rolling out in October 2023, during the company's so-called "Year of Efficiency," which centered on -- among other initiatives -- internal layoffs and a shift in focus toward AI. While Meta pushes new AI tools to businesses to help them sell products, the company is also working towards automating the entirety of the advertising production process, from ideation to campaign launch -- although it isn't totally clear at this point what such comprehensive automation might look like in practice. Also: The work AI should really be doing, according to these pros Similarly, Amazon unveiled an agent last month that can assist with every step of creating a short video ad, including the generation of custom voiceovers.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/openai-valuation-reaches-500-billion-topping-musks-spacex/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:37:55Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Could AMD Make Intel's Business as Hot as Its Stock?

Intel (INTC) was down and out, and then the White House flipped a switch and made it one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Semafor yesterday reported chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was in early talks to become an Intel Foundry customer. The report noted it was unclear how much of AMD’s business would go to Intel instead of its primary manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), or if the deal would include a direct investment. The White House is pushing hard to prop up Intel, which has spurred an outpouring of support for the embattled chipmaker from major tech companies. But none of the deals announced so far have come with commitments to use Intel's foundry. A manufacturing deal would signal more concrete support for Intel, giving investors more faith in the sustainability of its turnaround. The agreement would make AMD the latest in a string of entities partnering with or investing in Intel to extend a lifeline to one of the only U.S. companies capable of manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Japanese tech investor SoftBank in August invested $2 billion shortly before the White House converted Intel’s CHIPS Act grants into an approximately 10% equity stake. Nvidia (NVDA) followed suit in September when it said it would invest $5 billion and partner with Intel on new products. Intel has also reportedly discussed a tie-up with Apple (AAPL). Intel’s stock has soared amid the shows of support. Shares have doubled in value since hitting a year-to-date low in early April, and are up about 80% since CEO Lip-Bu Tan sat down with President Donald Trump in early August. It was shortly after that meeting that talk of the government taking a stake in Intel seemed to turn the tide in its favor. President Trump has made reviving American manufacturing a cornerstone of his second term, and semiconductors have taken on extra importance in the context of the U.S/China AI arms race and geopolitical tensions centered on Taiwan, where the majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are made. The White House appears to think Intel is America’s best hope for making the kinds of chips deemed essential to securing technological and military superiority. Securing AMD as a foundry customer would be a major win for Intel, which has struggled for years to compete with TSMC, the world’s largest and most advanced contract chip maker. However, some analysts are skeptical that a foundry deal will materialize. “We could easily believe stories of companies (AMD or otherwise) seeking equity stakes, possibly at the encouragement of the administration,” wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a note on Thursday. “Hopes for a foundry deal (from anyone) seem very premature to us though, and not just because Intel and AMD remain locked in a competitive product battle that the latter is clearly winning at the moment.” The biggest challenge facing Intel in its efforts to strengthen its foundry business is capability, according to Bernstein. Intel’s new 18A manufacturing process, which is supposed to make chips faster and more energy efficient, “has suffered from delays and a general lack of foundry interest,” wrote Rasgon in August. And its next-gen 14A process, he says, is still years off. Investments from the government and tech partners may give Intel the capital it needs to improve its processes, but that will take time and Rasgon “suspect[s] concrete foundry announcements will have to wait until Intel can definitively demonstrate capability.” In the meantime, Rasgon expects to see more rumors of foundry deals bubble up as the White House carries on with its campaign to reinvigorate America’s industrial base.

Title: Elon Musk's Net Worth Just Hit A New Record—Here's How He Made $500 Billion
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/elon-musk-net-worth-record-usd500-billion-11823006

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

BySteve Denning, Senior Contributor. In my last article, How To Picture—And Understand—The Dow For The First Time, I showed how understanding the American stock market involves mastering the relationship between the long-term total return of leading firms and their performance on three key value-creating principles: Understanding how leading European stocks perform on the same measures in in Figure 1 provides further illumination. with some differences. Some of the American firms in the Dow win big in tech (The Mag 7 firms) but Europe dominates fashion (Hermès, LVMH) and has winners in tech (ASML) and defense.(RNMBF). Overall, European stocks have fewer big winners but also fewer bad losers. Value creation is key to long term performance in both, Firms doing consistently well on all three value-creation principles create more long term value than firms that don’t. 1.

Title: ChatGPT owner OpenAI hits $500B valuation after massive sale of shares

Full Content:
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: Why Adobe Stock Is A Cash Engine?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/02/why-adobe-stock-is-a-cash-engine/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:13:58Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe stock (NASDAQ: ADBE) is down 22% this year, primarily due to rising concerns centered on rising competition from both lower-cost creative software alternatives and new AI-powered tools, combined with signs of slowing growth in the company’s subscription business. Despite these headwinds, we believe the stock warrants a close look. Here is why we believe Adobe deserves your attention. Free Cash Flow Yield is calculated as free cash flow per share divided by the stock price. Why does this matter? High cash generation per share allows a company to invest in further revenue growth or distribute dividends, or buybacks to shareholders. For context, Adobe offers a wide array of software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, catering to enterprise clients in the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. But do these figures convey the whole picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine if Adobe still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. This is just one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio takes a broader approach, aimed at mitigating stock-specific risks while providing exposure to potential upside. In fact, it has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The following statistics stem from a high FCF yield selection strategy between 12/31/2016 and 6/30/2025. These statistics are calculated based on monthly selections and assume that once a stock is chosen, it cannot be re-selected for the next 180 days. That being said, Adobe has faced considerable declines during difficult periods. It dropped roughly 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decrease was around 60%. Even less severe declines, such as in 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic, erased approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite its numerous advantages, Adobe is not immune to adverse market conditions. However, the risk extends beyond major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market environments—consider events such as earnings releases, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor—especially given the fluctuations associated with individual stocks. Instead, look at the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products

Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process? Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit let you: There isn’t a magic formula for getting ChatGPT to recommend your products. But the brands that consistently get recommended all have three things in common: Get these right, and you’re not just optimizing for ChatGPT Shopping.

Title: OpenAI hits $500 billion valuation after share sale

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios announces Liverpool shutdown and workforce cuts in Sweden
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Just-Cause-developer-Avalanche-Studios-announces-Liverpool-shutdown-and-workforce-cuts-in-Sweden.1129380.0.html
Time Published: 2025-10-02T04:41:00Z
Full Content:
The Swedish developer behind the Just Cause and Mad Max series, Avalanche Studios, has announced the shutdown of its Liverpool studio, alongside a reduction of workforce at its core Malmo and Stockholm locations. The studio broke the news in a statement published on the company’s website on September 30, 2025, amid ongoing hurdles in the gaming industry. The Liverpool studio, established in 2020 as part of its global expansion, has now ceased operation entirely. Previously, the Liverpool location focused on support roles and had not released any standalone titles. Avalanche stated: In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success best. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio and to initiate a collective consultation process as required by UK law. This will impact all “Avalanchers” in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmo and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs. The company also mentioned that it is focusing on offering full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time and that, despite the structural changes, the studio will remain fully committed to delivering amazing games to its passionate players. Currently, the number of affected employees remains under wraps. Avalanche Studios Group employs more than 600 people worldwide. This move marks the third such action by the company in just over a year, following the shutdown of its New York and Montreal offices in June 2024, which resulted in 50 layoffs. This announcement comes just one month after Microsoft canceled the co-op heist game, Contraband, which was being developed by Avalanche’s Liverpool team, which was first revealed four years ago in 2021. In August 2025, Microsoft paused development on the title amid its sweeping layoffs, and Avalanche announced that “active development has now stopped.” Considering the given circumstances, it seems unlikely that Contraband will be released anytime soon.
