BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has featured on the $13.5 trillion asset manager's homepage, representing one of three major investment themes as the market heads into 2026. BlackRock says its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was one of its three biggest investment themes in 2025, putting it alongside Treasury bills and the largest US tech stocks. The asset manager named its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) alongside its ETF tracking Treasury bills and another tied to the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. IBIT has attracted more than $25 billion in net inflows this year, ranking sixth among all ETFs and trailing broad index funds, despite the fund delivering a negative return so far for 2025. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on Monday that BlackRock's naming IBIT signals the firm isn’t fazed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30% fall from its high set in October. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed a similar sentiment on Friday, saying if the ETF “can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.” The $25 billion in inflows adds to the roughly $37 billion that IBIT brought in over 2024, bringing its total inflows since launch to $62.5 billion, Farside Investors data shows. IBIT’s flow tally is more than five times that of its nearest competitor, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Related: Recent Bitcoin miner capitulation may signal bottom is near: VanEck BlackRock filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September. The product seeks to sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has exceeded expectations too, attracting over $9.1 billion worth of inflows this year, bringing its total tally to nearly $12.7 billion. It also filed to register an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF in November to complement ETHA. BlackRock initially opted not to incorporate staking in ETHA. However, a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission has loosened its ETF standards, allowing asset managers to experiment with new product ideas. BlackRock hasn’t participated in the altcoin ETF craze that other asset managers have taken part in, which has so far seen the likes of Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) products launch in recent months.

Title: Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington

Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that financier Mark Wiseman will be Canada's next ambassador to the U.S. Wiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations regarding the review of their free trade agreement TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners. Wiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement. “Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.” Wiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal during his first term in office and included a clause to possibly renegotiate it in 2026. Wiseman, 55, ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan and also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. He is a friend of Carney, who ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. In 2016 Wiseman became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Wiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though his tenure at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. He has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp. “Mark Wiseman is a business type with Wall Street connections whose profile is in sync with the current focus on trade and economic investment of both the Carney government and the Trump administration. Yet, Wiseman has no prior diplomatic experience," said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. In October, Trump cut off tariff negotiations with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an antitariff advertisement in the U.S. It followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG Published Dec 23, 2025, 07:40 AM Updated Dec 23, 2025, 07:36 PM LONDON – Sir James Dyson is reshaping how he manages Britain’s biggest fortune, streamlining his sprawling business empire across three continents after new leaders took the reins of his family holding company. Weybourne, the Dyson family’s investment firm, has transferred funds totalling at least £624 million (S$1.08 billion) from a major UK entity in 2025 to its Singapore holding company, reducing the British unit’s share capital to £1, according to an analysis of registry filings by Bloomberg. It has also finalised earlier plans to close two British firms overseeing property investments and transferred part of their share capital to another entity in Singapore, where Mr Dyson’s eponymous vacuum maker has its global headquarters. Meanwhile, Weybourne has posted job openings in recent weeks for a “new team” in Singapore to support a multi-asset investment portfolio and has scaled back its US footprint after spending almost US$200 million (S$257 million) on New York real estate. A representative for the 78-year-old – Britain’s richest person with a net worth of about US$16.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – declined to comment. The changes are likely “part of a multi-year succession road map”, said Mr Martin Roll, a global family business strategist and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. It is “long-term planning”. The moves signal that Weybourne’s new leadership is leaving its mark on Mr Dyson’s fortune, taking steps to reduce the complexity of a business empire that has rapidly expanded in recent years, after he extracted large sums from his namesake technology company to diversify his wealth. Mr Martin Bowen, a legal veteran from Dyson Group, became Weybourne’s chief executive in February following the retirement of former army officer James Bucknall, who held the role for more than a decade. Mr Martin Bowen Weybourne also promoted senior money manager Jane Simpson to chief investment officer for its financial assets in a London-based role in 2024, when former BlackRock executive Alastair Peters became chief financial officer (CFO) in a previously unreported move. Weybourne’s new team in Singapore will work with the CFO unit led by Mr Peters, who turns 43 in December and forms part of a younger set of executives at the family investment firm. Mr Bowen, a former chief legal officer at Dyson’s technology firm who is 57 in December, is a decade younger than the former CEO Mr Bucknall, highlighting how longstanding money managers of the super-rich need to hone succession plans for their own leadership as well as for their employers. At least a fifth of the world’s 500 richest people now have a family office, helping preserve fortunes totalling more than US$5 trillion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. “People forget that family offices are another family business,” said Ms Christina Wing, co-founder of Wingspan Legacy Partners, which advises billionaire dynasties. “They also need to change.” Like many family offices, Weybourne reflects its founder’s roots, bearing the name of a coastal village in the part of England where Mr Dyson grew up. The month after Mr Bowen became its CEO in February, the firm’s main British entity, Weybourne Limited, returned £24.2 million in share capital to its Singapore parent company, filings show. It withdrew a further £600 million in December, reversing a transaction between the entities four years ago that a Dyson representative previously told Bloomberg helped improve governance structures. Separately, under plans disclosed publicly in late 2024, a Weybourne property firm based in Britain closed in December after transferring ownership of its real estate investments to a Singapore entity in a £26.4 million transaction. Another property firm in Britain named after Mr Dyson’s Gloucestershire estate, Dodington Park, closed in 2025 after similarly transferring its real estate investments to the billionaire’s namesake farming business. That inflow for Dyson Farming achieved “operational efficiencies”, Weybourne Limited said in its 2024 accounts filed in October, underscoring the benefits of corporate housekeeping across the British billionaire’s empire. Mr Dyson is lining up a further diversification of his fortune, which remains mostly tied up in his technology company, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. In 2025, his vacuum maker committed to boosting its annual dividends to the billionaire’s Singapore-based Weybourne Holdings to £225 million, reversing a recent trend of declining payouts. It previously paid a £200 million dividend for 2024, its lowest total in at least seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While there has been a global boom over the past two decades in the number of family investment firms catering to the needs of the world’s ultra-rich, few are as large as Weybourne. Created in 2013, it now has more than 70 employees across teams in London and Singapore, where it set up an insurance unit three years ago to help protect Dyson’s financial affairs and has recently sought to hire staff. Weybourne last publicly disclosed net assets in the UK of £4.5 billion in 2019, when the technology firm Mr Dyson founded more than two decades ago said it was relocating its headquarters to Singapore. Its other recent job openings include a UK position on its human resources team, a rare feature among investment firms of the ultra-wealthy. “It keeps a lot in-house that peers outsource,” said Mr Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices. “Weybourne needs the bodies.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Wall Street’s bid on crypto dominated 2025 but what’s the demand outlook for 2026?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/wall-street-ruled-crypto-in-2025-what-s-the-demand-outlook-for-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-22T23:06:27Z
Full Content:
Fed policy shifts and crypto-friendly regulation point to a bullish 2026, but AI risk, ETF flows and consumer stress could test demand. 2025 was a blockbuster year for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market as crypto-friendly legislators platformed growth-focused regulation and Wall Street finally accepted Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and numerous altcoins as a valid asset class worthy of inclusion in an investment portfolio. The global bid on Bitcoin, Ether and Solana’s SOL (SOL) token was near immeasurable, with total net flows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching $57 billion and the total net assets across the ETFs reaching $114.8 billion. Going into 2026, the real question is whether the pace of institutional, corporate and government-level adoption, which were critical price drivers in 2025, will continue. Since October, the robust inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETF tapered off and, in some cases, turned into a sellers' market for weeks on end, and this was followed by a 30% correction in BTC and 50% in Ether. In an interview with Schwab Network’s Nicole Petallides, Cointelegraph head of markets Ray Salmond said that the crypto market’s performance in early 2026 will depend on a range of factors. .@Cointelegraph's Head of Markets Ray Salmond tells @NPetallides that he expects bitcoin, ethereum and solana demand in the spot and ETF markets to set the tone for the industry in 2026.For more market news, tune into: https://t.co/PYaqKPRp8C pic.twitter.com/ZCp1EIXyUh Beyond the ETF flows and demand across spot markets like Binance and Coinbase, investor sentiment regarding the immense size of the AI industry buildout and the performance of the tech-heavy S&P 500 is likely to have a direct impact on crypto markets. The AI buildout, company valuations, fundraising, IPO performance and whether datacenter hyperscalers continue to propel the equities markets alongside MAG7 will remain at the forefront of everyone’s mind. In the interview, Salmond said rapid balance sheet expansion was a strategy that supercharged tech-related equities in 2025 as hyperscalers spent double-digit billions on data centers, compute, Nvidia GPUs and energy. At some point in 2026, the expectation will be that these companies demonstrate that they can monetize their investments, or at least finance the expansions from their internal cash flow. In the latter half of 2025, Oracle, Meta and Nvidia saw their stock prices fall as the market questioned whether there was a chance that some of these companies’ free cash flow could go negative. If investors smell smoke related to debt-heavy, cash-poor AI and quantum computing companies in 2026, there’s likely to be some negative reaction. How these shockwaves carry over to the SPX, DOW, and, by proxy, crypto is something investors will need to keep on the watch list. A bullish event worth watching in the early part of 2026 will be whether or not the Clarity Act becomes law. The crypto lobby aimed to have this act passed into law before the end of the year, but the lengthy government shutdown delayed progress on hammering it out. If passed, the Clarity Act will provide clearer rules and the necessary environment for FinTech innovators to sandbox in the US, and the hope is that more offshored crypto businesses will headquarter back in the United States. It will define which regulatory bodies (SEC and CFTC) have jurisdiction over various crypto assets, depending on whether they are classified as securities or commodities. There’s also a strong emphasis on consumer protections, and a better framework in this area could provide the necessary transparency that businesses and consumers need to confidently invest in crypto assets. The Federal Reserve’s policy shift is expected to further morph into an easy money regime, and US President Donald Trump’s early 2026 Fed chair selection is anticipated to bring up to 100 basis points in rate cuts. According to Salmond, Salmond explained that “the job market is softening and this cooling trend is predicted to carry on in 2026. The ‘transitory’ impact of the Trump tariffs has resulted in elevated goods and services costs, health insurance premiums will rise, and retail investor confidence may drop as layoffs are announced, consumer debt rises and disposable income falls.” At the same time, “investors expect Fed rate cuts to result in lower mortgage rates, compel banks to loosen the purse strings for lending and lure consumers to go buy more stuff. But, the potential return of easy money policy and big government spending essentially confirms that the US is kicking the debt bomb further down the road.” Related: JPMorgan explores crypto trading for institutional clients: Report In Q1 2026, the dilemma investors will have to contend with is whether there are signals that prove that the Fed's easy money trade is being front-run and possibly sold on confirmation, or will the evolving Fed policy also reinvigorate the bull market seen across equities in 2025 and extend to crypto? Investors who prioritize optionality and a nimble footprint should be able to avoid some of the pitfalls of a narrative and speculation-driven market, where the MAG7 and AI markets could prove to be overvalued. On paper, the big picture view for 2026 is bullish, especially when considering the Trump economic mandate, Fed policy and crypto-friendly regulation, but it’s the unknown outcomes of the AI buildout and the actual impact of rate cuts on the consumer and economy that are going to determine the direction markets take in Q1 and Q2.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S: Wegovy® pill approved in the US as first oral GLP-1 for weight management

December 22, 2025 17:50 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 22 December 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Wegovy® pill (once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg) to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term and to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events*. The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2. In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1. The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1. The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy® pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. About the OASIS trial programmeOASIS was a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg in obesity. The global clinical phase 3 programme consisted of four trials, enrolling approximately 1,300 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.OASIS 4 was a 64-week efficacy and safety phase 3b trial of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg versus placebo in 307 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities. About Wegovy® Wegovy® is now approved as once-daily Wegovy® pill (semaglutide tablet 25 mg) and once-weekly Wegovy® injection (semaglutide injectable 2.4 mg) by the FDA. The approval of Wegovy® pill is based on a New Drug Application to reduce excess body weight in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related medical condition. Wegovy® is approved as a once-weekly injection by the EMA and widely by other regulatory authorities. The Wegovy® pill is currently pending marketing approval from the EMA and other regulatory authorities. Wegovy® is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in adults with obesity or overweight and in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, and approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Furthermore, Wegovy® injection is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, and approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google told employees it will be "ramping up" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card. The company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider. PERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US. Tech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to "significant" delays, Business Insider reported. According to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience. Every time Hugh publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered. "Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible," the memo read. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role. Google paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. The sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers. Google applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said. Google told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said. It also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are "not in good standing" with the company. "Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM," it read. MI means "moderate impact" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews. Have something to share?

Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has appointed financier and former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as Canada's ambassador to the US, ahead of major trade talks with the Trump administration. Wiseman, an experienced investment manager, takes on the task as Canada works to reset its strained relations with the US while preparing for a tense review of the current free trade deal. His appointment follows current ambassador Kirsten Hillman's announcement that she would be ending her tenure in Washington. Carney said Wiseman "brings immense experience, extensive contacts and deep commitment" to the post at a "crucial time of transformation" for Canada and the US. "As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions, while building opportunities for both Canada and the United States," the prime minister said in a statement on Monday. The new ambassador is set to take on the role in mid-February, Carney added. Wiseman, 55, reportedly a close friend of Carney's, is currently a senior advisor and chairman of Canada at Lazard, a financial services company, and a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy firm. In March, Carney added him as a member of the prime minister's council on Canada-US relations, a group formed to navigate the currently turbulent bilateral relationship. The Yale alumni also previously worked in both New York and Paris as a lawyer with law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is one of the co-founders of the Century Initiative, a charitable organisation that has lobbied for increased immigration levels in Canada, with the goal reaching 100 million people in the country by 2100 to support economic growth. The role with Century Initiative stirred up criticism ahead of his appointment. Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has accused Wiseman of being "someone who proposed a policy that inflates the cost of living, takes away jobs and puts pressure on our health care system". "Why does the Prime Minister want to appoint him as ambassador to Washington?" Beyond domestic politics, Wiseman will face the currently thorny relationship between the US and Canada while in Washington. Trump halted trade talks with Canada in late October in anger over an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province of Ontario and aired in the US. Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on Canadian metals, lumber and automotives. He has also imposed a sweeping tariff rate of 35% on all goods, though most have been exempt under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) - known at the USMCA in the US - trade pact. A scheduled review of CUSMA is now underway, starting with public hearings and stakeholder consultations, after which Canada, the US and Mexico could agree to renew it, or let it expire. Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say. The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents. The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump. Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a "witch hunt" is taking place. The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Canada names new ambassador to US as key trade talks loom

Terms of North American free trade deal set to be renegotiated in 2026 under shadow of US tariff policies. By News Agencies Share Save Canada has named former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as the new ambassador to the United States, with upcoming trade and tariff negotiations likely to dominate his tenure. In a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Wiseman would help manage Canada’s relationship with the US, which has grown stormy under tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “Mr Wiseman will be a key contributor to the government’s efforts to advance Canada-US priorities, including secure borders [and] a strengthened trade and investment relationship,” Carney said in a statement. Relations between the countries have somewhat settled after the US launched a trade war targeting Canadian goods, prompting anger at what was widely viewed as an act of economic hostility against a longtime ally. The Trump administration has targeted Canada with several rounds of tariffs, including a blanket 25 percent tariff for allegedly failing to stem migration and fentanyl flows from Canada. That came despite data showing only a tiny fraction of fentanyl smuggled into the US crosses the US-Canada border. The US subsequently imposed sweeping tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminium imports, all of which disproportionately affected Canada. In August, Trump and Carney, who was elected on a promise to take a tough stance in the face of US threats, reached agreements to roll back some of the measures. A more comprehensive deal has remained elusive. Trump has also stirred anger by repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st US state, which Carney has firmly rejected. Those tensions could re-emerge in the coming months as officials set out to renegotiate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, also known as the USMCA. Canadian officials are set to begin discussions with US counterparts in mid-January on the USMCA, which currently exempts many key products that would otherwise be tariffed under Trump’s policies. Canada is the top export destination for 36 US states, with nearly $2.7bn worth of goods and services crossing the border each day. Carney has hedged his expectations for the future of trade relations with the US, saying that Canada will defend its economic interests but that US policy is beyond its control.

Title: Trump Loses GOP Support on China Policy

Donald Trump is wrecking so much with his blend of impulsivity and personal graft and vanity that it is sometimes hard to distinguish the consequential from the incidental. Far more important than his plastering his name everywhere is Trump’s incoherent China policy, where he keeps raising and lowering tariffs to no strategic purpose while at the same time giving away crown jewels or finding a way to sell them. More from Robert Kuttner Earlier this month, there was widespread outrage in the defense community when Trump reversed policy and allowed Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, its second most advanced artificial intelligence chip. Seven Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a letter warning that “the President’s dangerous decision to give away crucial national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities.” The decision to allow the sale followed months of courtship and flattery of Trump by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Nvidia used a brand-new tech conference in D.C. to lavish praise on Trump, and Huang gave generously to Trump’s ballroom project and has claimed that Trump is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution (his words) with AI. The H200 decision came right after an Oval Office meeting between Huang and Trump. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In line with Trump’s habit of asking private companies to pay tribute, Nvidia will kick back 25 percent “revenue share” of the value of its China sales to the U.S. government. This doesn’t go directly into Trump’s pocket. But in the great favor bank, Trump will find ways to cash in this favor to Huang for his personal enrichment. Now, however, Congress has pushed back big-time. In the annual defense authorization bill that Trump has just signed into law, a broad bipartisan coalition inserted provisions codifying a 2023 Biden executive order requiring national-security screening of outbound U.S. capital investment in China. In past years, U.S. venture capital firms have supplied a lot of the funds for AI development in China. Funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have major investments in China’s marquee tech company, Alibaba. The authorization bill does not reverse the Nvidia chip approval, but it sends a shot across Trump’s bow and signals more willingness of Republicans to defect from automatic support for Trump. In supporting the new restrictions, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned, “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Congress needs to go further and ban sweetheart deals like the Nvidia waiver. Meanwhile, Trump is pulling back on technologies where China increasingly dominates, such as EVs and renewable energy. His treatment of the Caribbean as an American lake and Ukraine as part of greater Russia is a virtual invitation for China to invade Taiwan. While Trump is obsessed with Venezuela as a national-security threat and imposes vanity tariffs on friendly nations like Canada that fall short of his standards of genuflection, militarily and commercially he is letting China clean America’s clock.

(Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold. But at the start of the year, a huge focus was placed on a boardroom in a temporary office in Sydney, where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board was meeting to set interest rates. At the start of the year, anticipation of a cut to official interest rates was intense. The RBA had hiked the cash rate to 4.35 per cent in November 2023 and held it there through 2024. With around one-third of Australians servicing a mortgage — and a further third renting, many from landlords with mortgages — the public was feeling the pain of higher repayments. Consumers slashed their spending as the cost-of-living crisis kept chomping at household budgets. "There was undoubtedly a lot of tension," said independent economist Nicki Hutley. "Part of the reason [households] were doing it tough wasn't just interest rates, it was higher-than-usual inflation." "We're very tightly poised", said independent economist Nicki Hutley, between lowering inflation without risking some significant rises in the unemployment rate. (ABC News: John Gunn) By late 2022, consumer prices were rising at a rate of 7.8 per cent a year. That tempered this year, with price rises at one point slowing to 1.9 per cent, below the 2–3 per cent target range the central bank was aiming for. The RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points in February, May and August. "The pressure was there because we could see inflation was coming down, we could see the economy was really, really sluggish," Ms Hutley said. NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

Title: The biggest games industry news stories of 2025 | Year in Review

AI outrage, a delay to GTA 6, takeover deals for EA and Warner Bros., US tariffs, the Steam Machine, Switch 2… there's a lot to get through Join us as we journey back through 2025 via the biggest games industry news stories of the year, including massive takeover deals, the closure of historic studios, big hardware launches, big hardware reveals, and a lot of bother about tariffs. Following the catastrophic failure of Concord in 2024, Sony pulled back further from the live-service strategy it had embarked upon under the leadership of Jim Ryan, who back in 2022 said that through "close collaboration between Bungie and the PlayStation Studios, we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026." In January, Sony confirmed the cancellation of two unannounced live service titles from Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games; this and other high-profile live-service failures and cancellations led Rob Fahey to suggest that the industry's decade-long race for live-service riches was finally over. In an interview in January, Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, gave further details about the plans to make Xbox first-party titles available across other platforms. "There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," he said. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would go on to launch on PS5 in April, and in July it was reported that six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation from April 6 to July 5 were published by Microsoft. In October, something that would have once been unthinkable happened – Halo: Campaign Evolved was announced for PS5. Warner Bros. Games announced the closure of Warner Bros. Games San Diego, Player First Games (maker of MultiVersus), and Monolith Productions in February. Monolith had been in existence for more than 30 years, and was behind such titles as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. At the time of its closure, the studio was working on a new Wonder Woman game, which has now been cancelled. Although total layoff figures were down by around a third in 2025, the year saw the closure of a number of studios, including Ubisoft Leamington and a range of NetEase developers: see our feature looking back at the year in layoffs for more details. On the same day as Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct presentation (April 2), US president Donald Trump announced punitive tariffs on goods arriving from dozens of countries, causing a rush of speculation on how this would affect the games industry. Nintendo quickly moved to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States; they finally went live on April 24, with the console's US price unchanged, but with Switch 2 accessories rising in price "due to changes in market conditions." Sony said it was considering manufacturing PlayStation 5 consoles in the US as a result of tariffs, and retro handheld maker Anbernic suspended shipments to the States. Nintendo later hiked the US prices of the original Switch by up to 15%, and the US saw similar price rises for the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Rob Fahey suggested the US tariffs "will likely force a strategic shift around the next generation of console hardware." In May, a US court enforced an injunction which prohibits Apple from collecting fees on app purchases made outside its App Store; the landmark ruling is likely to change the app landscape. The previous month, Apple was fined €500 million ($568 million) by the EU for deterring third-party payment methods on the App Store. Similarly, Google made changes in October to allow third-party payment systems after a US court ruling said Google could no longer restrict customers to using Google Play Billing. Then in November, Google and Epic Games agreed on a deal that will potentially pave the way for third-party app stores to be made available on Android worldwide. The Savvy Games Group subsidiary Scopely officially closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Niantic's game business on May 29. The deal included Niantic's entire game development team, the games Pokémon Go, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, and the apps Campfire and Wayfarer. Scopely was previously acquired by the Saudi Arabian multinational game investment group Savvy Games Group back in July 2023 for $4.9 billion. Nintendo launched the Switch 2 on June 5, which went on to sell over 3.5 million units in the first four days and 10.36 million units in its first four months, doubling the figures for the original Switch over the same timeframe. However, questions were soon raised about the relative lack of indie games, the seemingly slow rollout of dev kits, and the use of Game-Key Cards in terms of game preservation. Plus, the Switch 2's initial sales momentum seemed to wind down towards the end of the year: in the US, Circana reported that the combined sales of the Switch and Switch 2 in November were 10% lower than the sales of the Switch in the same period last year. The co-op climbing game Peak from Aggro Crab and Landfall became a breakout hit on Steam in the summer, notching up 10 million sales by the end of August. Not bad for a game that evolved from a month-long game jam. Peak was part of a wave of indie co-op games that hit it big on Steam in 2025, with titles like RV There Yet? shifting 1.3 million units in a week and REPO selling more than 12.3 million (according to Video Game Insights). Other indie titles that became unexpectedly huge on Steam included Dispatch, Megabonk, and the drug-dealing simulator Schedule I. The leadership team of Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds was removed by owner and publisher Krafton in July. There followed a very public falling out and subsequent legal action, with claims and counter-claims being thrown back and forth by Krafton and the former Unknown Worlds employees: you can follow the whole saga here. Another big legal battle kicked off in July when Sony sued Tencent, alleging the latter's game Light of Motiram is a "slavish clone" of its tentpole Horizon series. Tencent subsequently accused Sony of seeking a "monopoly on genre conventions," before eventually settling with Sony in December. Microsoft initiated a huge round of job cuts in July, affecting around 4% of the company's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in the games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Rare's Everwild was cancelled, along with an unannounced ZeniMax MMO. In an opinion piece at the time, Lewis Packwood said: "It's hard to dispel the feeling that these cuts are simply part of a disordered retreat." The games industry as a whole saw more than 9,000 layoffs in 2025. Members of the US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted to end its 11-month strike in July, after reaching a pay agreement and ensuring "safety guardrails and gains around AI." The strike began in July 2024 in a bid to protect voice actors as more and more studios explore generative AI. However, as GamesIndustry.biz revealed in a feature in December, contracts for game actors still remain a nightmare in the UK. The UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) came into force in July, requiring companies to ensure that their games use highly effective age verification. However, some game firms struggled with the complexities of the OSA, with many having to rethink game features, and Itch blocked adult-oriented games on its store after being unable to find a satisfactory age verification solution in time. Jeremy Peel spoke to a range of people affected by the OSA for an in-depth feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Over the summer, a pressure group campaign resulted in a crackdown on adult games on Steam and Itch. It all started with a sexually explicit visual novel called No Mercy: UK technology secretary Peter Kyle had criticised the title in April, and it was subsequently removed from sale in the UK by Zerat Games. But the Australian group Collective Shout took the campaign to the next level by contacting payment processing companies, which put pressure on Steam and Itch to remove sex-related titles. Jeremy Peel gave a rundown of exactly what happened in this feature for GamesIndustry.biz. Activision studio Raven Software ratified its first union contract with Microsoft in August. The new agreement guarantees a 10% wage increase over the next two years, as well as seeking to eliminate crunch and provide workers with seven days' notice for any additional mandatory overtime. A few months later, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance became the first recognised workers union in the UK games industry. On August 22, Team Cherry announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong would release on September 4, prompting other games companies to rapidly shift their release dates in response. Such was its popularity that the game's release crashed global stores right across Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam's digital platforms, and it would go on to sell over 7 million copies in three months. In September, the Game Developers Conference announced a rebrand as GDC Festival of Gaming, leaving some to speculate that the conference would now be welcoming consumers as well as industry attendees. However, in an interview the following month, the organisers indicated that this wouldn't be the case, saying: "The festival part of the GDC Festival is that we're broadening out what the conference is and does, but not into a consumer space." Reaction to the rebrand was mixed. In late September, it was announced that EA would be purchased by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. The total deal is worth $55 billion, but $20 billion of that total is being borrowed by the consortium. The deal will almost certainly require regulatory approval, and is expected to close during Q1 FY27, if given the go ahead. Mat Piscatella of Circana was one of several industry commentators who expressed worries about the EA deal: "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said. A disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in October took thousands of web-based businesses – about a third of the internet – offline, with parts of the US being hardest hit. In the games industry, web-based services affected included Fortnite, Roblox, and PlayStation Network. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. At the start of November, Take Two Interactive delayed GTA 6 for a second time, moving next year's biggest release back six months to November 19, 2026. The delay caused a wide range of reactions in the games industry. "For many of our clients, it opens up a valuable window," said Damien Sarrazin, CEO & founder of HomeRun PR, "one that was previously seen as completely dominated by Rockstar's marketing and media gravity." Valve announced three new devices in November: the Steam Frame VR headset, a new Steam controller, and the console-like Steam Machine. Of the three, the Steam Machine – set to be released in early 2026 with "pretty competitive" pricing to equivalent PCs – caused the most stir. Rob Fahey suggested it could be an "industry turning point." On November 21, Ubisoft announced the completion of Tencent's €1.16 billion investment in Vantage Studios, the division in charge of the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Prior to the announcement, Ubisoft had postponed the release of its H1 2025-26 financial results and suspended share trading, prompting widespread speculation. At the start of December, news emerged that Netflix was buying entertainment giant Warner Bros. in a deal valued at around $82.7 billion. Soon after, Paramount Skydance launched a rival hostile takeover attempt, which Warner's board advised shareholders to reject. Netflix said that it did not "attribute any value" to Warner Bros' games business as part of its proposed acquisition of the entertainment giant, leaving many to wonder what the deal will mean for Warner Bros. Games. Activision announced it will no longer ship back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, following significant underperformance of the latest release in the franchise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This year, the franchise faced fierce competition from the likes of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. Rhys Elliott at Alinea Analytics said: "For years, Call of Duty was virtually immune to competition, but now the player base is splitting and annoyed, the franchise is creatively drained, and rivals have been more methodical and focused." Finally, comments made about generative AI by Larian Studios head Swen Vincke in a Bloomberg interview sparked an explosion of posts on social media in December. This prompted Vincke to issue a hurried clarification, saying that the Baldur's Gate 3 studio is "not replacing concept artists with AI," and that it is only using AI at the "very early ideation stages" as a "rough outline for composition." The episode came on top of several outbursts of AI outrage throughout 2025, including a row over the use of AI speech in Embark Games' Arc Raiders, which prompted Epic Games' Tim Sweeney to wade into the debate in defence of the technology.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr: 2025’s Winners, 2026’s IPOs, and Why the Tech Lash Is Coming

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The year in review with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll The year that changed everything is almost over. In this special year-end episode, Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll break down the founders, funds, and companies that defined 2025—and make bold predictions for what’s coming in 2026. From Dario Amodei earning “Founder of the Year” to why SpaceX will IPO before OpenAI, from the talent wars that “threw all conventions out the window” to why unemployment data could trigger a massive tech lash—this is the definitive look at where we’ve been and where we’re going. Spoiler: If you’re a B2B company that didn’t reaccelerate with AI in 2025, you got an F minus. And if unemployment ticks up even 2-3 points next year for any reason? “Society will be terrified of AI.” The unanimous choice wasn’t about predictions of mass unemployment (which the panel largely dismissed). It was about execution. Claude 3.5 and 4 changed everything—enabling vibe coding, powering Cursor, making Lovable and Replit actually work. “Without this, we have no vibe coding,” Jason said. “Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” But it’s not just product. Rory highlighted Anthropic’s business execution: “Growth rate faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… he’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” Honorable mentions went to Gwyn Shotwell at SpaceX (“navigating geopolitically challenging times with Elon’s brand this year… exceptional”), Alex Wang at Scale AI (“the best of the pseudo-hire playbook—moment in time, playing your cards right”), and Vlad at Robinhood (“Nine products doing over $100 million in revenue. JFC.”). Index wins on pure execution: Wiz (announced this year, $32B), Figma (seed), and Revolut ($75B). “Competent execution across multiple different exits,” Rory said. “Exits are the coin of the realm.” But Jason gave his vote to Neo on aesthetics and hustle: first money into Cursor and Cognition. “24 months ago, he seemed to be having weird arguments with Gary Tan on Twitter. Now he’s literally hustling his way into cursor, hanging out at MIT, giving programming tests himself.” And the wildcard? Google—owning ~10% of SpaceX, ~14% of Anthropic, and the majority of Waymo. “Those three with double-digit ownerships, even if done in a circular way… corporate investor of the year.” Meta paying $100M for individual researchers. The $14B deal to acquire a company’s team while letting investors keep the husk. Nat and Daniel getting their venture fund acquired too. “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months,” Rory said. In retrospect, the logic makes sense: “If you’re spending $73 billion on capex, spending $5 billion to make sure the people using the capex know what they’re doing probably makes sense.” The other massive surprise? There’s no ceiling on venture outcomes anymore. Lovable going from $2B to $8B valuation in weeks. Anthropic at $100M being “the deal of the century from a risk-reward outcome.” “That there is no ceiling on venture… changes all the math and calculations.” “Every founder, every VC—our job was to ride this torrent of AI,” Jason explained. “If you’re not an LLM, your job this year was to ride the greatest wave of our lifetimes.” Databricks did exactly that. In 2021, Databricks was presenting about managing cloud compute and data—nothing about AI. Now they’re at $5B revenue growing 55%, accelerating, while Snowflake’s AI revenue remains small. “If we had to have canon of the year for who rode the AI wave and utterly changed the trajectory of the company, it would be Databricks.” Other breakouts: Eleven Labs (scaled to $400M ARR, standing off OpenAI competition—”$30 in 10 minutes versus $2,000 in two weeks”), and Open Evidence (capturing 500K of the 1M US doctors in one year by perfectly targeting medical search). Jason’s order: SpaceX goes first (probably summer), Canva second (“the AI story is not perfect, but the numbers are there—do it now before looking obsolete”), Databricks in the back half (“it’s just the Series M”), Anthropic at year-end (“the simpler way to solve their capital needs”). OpenAI? Probably mid-2027. “It’s burning too much.” The challenge: taking a company public at $1 trillion is an unsolved banking problem. “What do you do with $950 billion in stock when many owners have been in for 10-15 years? Could be tricky.” The top B2B public stocks (Palantir, Cloudflare, Monday, Shopify, CrowdStrike, Snowflake) have all figured out their AI tailwinds. Jason’s betting at least three stay in the top six next year: “I’m not a hedge fund guy, but the trends aren’t going to change much.” But the contrarian bet? Salesforce. Trading at all-time low revenue multiples (5-5.5x), but when Agent Force actually works at scale: “Every single Salesforce customer is going to want that product. Would you like this agent to automatically go after all the customers your team didn’t follow up with? Sign me the f— up.” The warning: Adobe is “the worst offender” for claiming $5B of “AI-influenced revenue” without net new bookings. “If you’re going to hide in your tower and say ‘we grew 8% but half was AI-influenced’—that’s table stakes.” “2025’s biggest failure was the co-pilot,” Jason said. “We’re not going to put it in our base product. We’re not going to make the core product better. But we’re not going to provide so much value that you want to pay for it. That was the cynical whiteboard of January 2025 that failed up and down the B2B board.” The counterexample? Notion. If they really hit 50% growth at $600M, the only explanation is customers paying $20/month instead of $10 for their AI offering. “I can’t use Notion without AI as a 10-year customer. It’s worth the 2x.” Very few B2B companies have earned that premium. Rory’s pick: Buy Google, short Nvidia. “If the capex cycle continues and we’re all still spending, Nvidia does fine. But unless they need continued acceleration… Google has upside if the capex tide goes out.” Jason’s counter: “You’re a fool to invest against Nvidia for 2026. There’s not enough time for competing GPUs and TPUs to get into data centers that don’t exist. 2027? I don’t know. But 2026—the bet’s still on.” Amazon is the underperformer candidate—only up 2% this year, and “there’s just not enough time” for their AI strategy to materialize. Here’s the prediction that should worry everyone: if unemployment ticks up 2-3 points for any reason—tariffs, business cycle, bank events—AI will take the blame. “All the AI executives talk about there will be an impact on unemployment,” Rory noted. “Politics doesn’t work by looking at BLS data by subgroup. All they’ll know is: unemployment’s ticked up, and those guys building AI are admitting the crime. They’re like, ‘We did it. We put you all out of a job.'” Jason agreed: “When there’s hard numbers at the top of the New York Times… it will become every dinner table conversation. Society will be terrified of AI.” The dark humor? “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “What was the biggest surprise of 2025? The three days when Windsurf was being bought by Cognition and I interviewed Varun the day before—are they being bought? Are they not? OpenAI was buying them and then they’re not—that was a bizarre moment.” “Nvidia investing $100 billion into OpenAI and the start of the circular deals… all of us giving up on caring about things like circular deals. We’ve all stopped caring. If it marks up my fund, great. It’s just the way it is now.” “Which companies go public in 2026? SpaceX, Canva, Databricks, Anthropic—four IPOs backloaded next year. OpenAI probably should have gone first, but it’s burning too much.” “The product of the year is Claude 3.5 or 3.7. Without this, we have no vibe coding. Without this, we have no Lovable, no Replit, no Cursor that really works. Many of these products existed for years. They did not work until Claude.” “What agents can do—we just started. Outside of parts of coding, we just started. We haven’t missed the boat as investors. We haven’t missed the boat.” “If the robots are going to take over society, I want to be sure that I own the robots.” “The entire convention on why people buy companies, how employees get treated, how much a human can be paid to do a job got thrown out of the window in the space of 6 months. Blew me away.” “Exits are the coin of the realm. The only fair way to measure things is: did you end up owning a lot and having big ownership in big exits?” “If the AI kind of lift starts to recede, they’ll all come down because they’re way over their long-term valuation. Pennies in front of steam wheels. Someone’s going to look up and say, ‘Oh my god, 70x… I should panic.'” This post is part of the ongoing 20VC x SaaStr collaboration.

BlackRock named its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) one of the top three investment themes for 2025, a striking move given bitcoin’s BTC$87,497.82 slide this year. The firm placed IBIT alongside two more traditional offerings: the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT). Bitcoin has dropped more than 4% year-to-date, the first decline in three years, and IBIT has mirrored that performance. Even so, the ETF has seen strong investor interest. IBIT ranks sixth among all ETFs by 2025 inflows, pulling in over $25 billion since January. “It's easy to frame this as BlackRock simply promoting its highest-revenue product,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “But I see it more as the firm doubling down on its conviction that bitcoin belongs in diversified portfolios.” Geraci noted that BlackRock has other ETFs, like the gold-focused IAU, that are outperforming IBIT and charge higher fees. Yet the firm is spotlighting a product that underperformed in 2025, a rare move in an industry that typically pushes its top-performing funds. “If the objective were purely revenue generation, BlackRock has no shortage of ETFs with significantly higher fees that it could emphasize instead,” he said. “Asset managers aren’t typically in the business of spotlighting underperforming products, particularly when they have a deep bench of outperforming alternatives they could highlight.” The inclusion of IBIT as a top 2025 theme signals a long-term bet on the crypto asset by the world’s largest asset manager. For investors who still see crypto as speculative or fringe, BlackRock’s positioning of bitcoin alongside cash and stocks may shift that perception.

Title: Real Estate ETF Poised For Breakout As Treasury Yields Drop And Cap Rates Compress

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLRE) has spent 2025 in the penalty box and looks poised to close the year… exactly where it started. That underperformance may be setting up a contrarian opportunity that makes 2026 explosive. The fund tracks real estate investment trusts as the sector transitions from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The biggest macro factor for XLRE in 2026 is the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory. According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)’s iShares outlook, the most likely path brings rates down as the Fed continues its monetary policy adjustments. That matters because real estate operates on spreads. When Treasury yields decline while REIT dividends hold steady or grow, real estate becomes more attractive on a relative basis. The mechanism is cap rate compression. As borrowing costs decline, property valuations rise because the same income stream gets divided by a lower discount rate. Industry data shows cap rates already declining in late 2025, with further drops expected in 2026 as financial pressures ease. This is the mathematical reality of how real estate gets priced. Investors should monitor the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections and monthly Treasury yield movements. When Treasury yields decline, that signals XLRE’s relative attractiveness is improving. XLRE’s micro story is its exposure to secular growth infrastructure. The fund holds positions in data center and cell tower REITs, including Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR). Equinix is among the top holdings showing positive earnings growth, while its peers saw earnings compress. Analysts project significant upside for Equinix and the most bullish outlook among major XLRE components. This matters because AI infrastructure spending isn’t slowing. Data centers and cell towers generate contractual income with built-in escalators, making them more predictable than traditional real estate. As interest rates decline, these high-quality assets should see valuation expansion first. Check XLRE’s monthly holdings updates on the State Street website to track shifts in data center exposure. Quarterly earnings from Equinix and Digital Realty, typically released in February, May, August, and November, provide early signals on demand trends. The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) offers similar real estate exposure with a slightly lower expense ratio and broader diversification across smaller REITs. It provides comparable income with less concentration risk in the top 10 holdings. For 2026, watch the Fed’s rate path and XLRE’s data center holdings. Those two factors will determine whether this year’s underperformance becomes next year’s breakout. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Microsoft layoffs: Perfect Dark VA says she recorded “entire chapters” before Xbox canceled reboot
URL: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-layoffs-Perfect-Dark-VA-says-she-recorded-entire-chapters-before-Xbox-canceled-reboot.1190598.0.html
Time Published: 2025-12-22T15:40:00Z
Full Content:
New information has come to light about the canceled reboot of the classic spy game Perfect Dark, stating that the game had met significant development milestones, with entire chapters of motion capture recorded before Microsoft shelved the project. Joanna Dark’s voice was lent by Alix Wilton-Regan, who recently spoke in an interview with TheGamer and revealed that Perfect Dark Reboot’s development had been in the works for many years. Early recording sessions began in 2023, steadily increased in 2024, and continued until the game’s cancellation. Joanna Dark’s voice actor said, “To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I’d done entire chapters of this universe.” She even mentioned that the game had completed several key developmental milestones, which Microsoft was pleased about. The Initiative Studio was developing Perfect Dark’s reboot in partnership with Crystal Dynamics under Xbox’s endorsement. The project was supposed to fill a void left by the absence of action-espionage games in recent years. However, that has changed with the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and the announcement of 007: First Light. The cancellation came as quite a shock to everyone. Wilton-Regan learned about it online, like the rest of the world, with no prior notice from Microsoft. She added: I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed. I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded. It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded. This decision came out of the blue, leading to thousands of layoffs in the Xbox Games division and the closure of many Xbox-partner studios, such as The Initiative. However, leadership from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics scoured for two months to secure new funding in a last-ditch effort. Interestingly, Wilton-Regan knew about these conversations and revealed that hope hadn’t died out for the Perfect Dark reboot, up until the last moment. She said: I couldn’t say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn’t gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping.

Title: If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall Street The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn’t a traditional dividend ETF – AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD’s price movements. AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund’s 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums. The fund’s income depends entirely on AMD’s volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD’s 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY’s triple-digit distribution rate. AMDY’s strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD’s appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield. More concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY’s distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY’s net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation. AMD’s business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY’s strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue. However, AMD’s valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY’s distributions come entirely from options premiums. AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week’s distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD’s price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund’s 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline. Investors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels. Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: 40 People Share The Most Disappointing, And Downright Rude Gifts They Ever Received At Work

Time Published: 2025-12-22T14:04:09Z
Full Content:
Get ready to cringe and laugh as we unveil the tales of 40 people who received gifts at work that were more bewildering than wonderful. From thoughtlessly re-gifted items to presents that made them question their colleagues’ sanity, these stories of disappointing and downright rude gifts are a hilarious reminder that sometimes, it’s truly the thought that counts (or the lack thereof). Imagine unwrapping a box of expired chocolates, or finding a regifted pen with someone else’s name on it – these are just a sneak peek of the gift-giving blunders waiting inside. So, grab your popcorn and prepare for a journey through the wacky world of workplace gifting gone wrong. You’ll either be grateful for your considerate coworkers or find solace knowing you’re not alone in the office gift-giving Hall of Shame! My mom’s boss gave everyone a pen (a really cr*ppy, normal pen) with their names printed on normal white printer paper that was scotch taped down the side of the pen. This sounds made up even to me as I type it, but it’s still in our junk drawer. A small, nickel-sized, heart-shaped rock sent in the mail. It was supposed to represent their appreciation for the extra work during Covid. All I could think of was Charlie Brown trick or treating, “I got a rock.” Not me, but one year the company my brother works for gave each employee a CD of the owner playing Christmas songs on the harmonica. A letter from the CEO telling us how he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family up north to go skiing. That was all. Two free tickets to a cinema. The issue was that the closest cinema in that particular chain was about 800 miles away from me. That year the company decided it wasn’t going to provide basic office supplies for the break room. Coffee, tea, eating utensils, napkins, nothing. That year for Christmas we all got a brown paper bags fashioned like lunches. Inside was a metal straw, cloth napkin, a child sized set of plastic cutlery that fit in a travel case, a copy paste printed piece of paper with food puns in relation to our job, and a single fun sized hundred grand candy bar. This Fortune 500 company had over a billion in raw profit that year. Oh, and the cutlery ended up getting recalled due to some terrible forever chemicals in them. An email that only upper management would be getting the end of year bonus (sent to entire company by accident instead of just upper management). Then laid off 2 weeks into the new year. Found out from a friend in the company a little while later that the board of directors held a vote. They keep their car allowances at the expense of a wave of layoffs, or lose their car allowances and 10-15 people get to keep their jobs. Pretty sure it was unanimous. No matter how many times a company says you’re family, just remember that it’s the type of family that would gladly cut your throat to make sure the fat cats get to eat. – strike-when-ready Noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I’m sure they were good and useful to some people, but I’m legally deaf. We were told we were receiving our Christmas bonuses soon, and then we were all given a poinsettia. The poinsettia in itself wasn’t so bad, mine is actually still alive years later, but the fact that they had the audacity to call it a bonus was absurd. Jelly of the Month membership instead of my Christmas bonus. I wanted to put a pool in the backyard but nope. – inkyblinkypinkysue I was gifted a ham for the holidays…..I’m Jewish. Not me but a friend – all staff at the hospital received a kitchen scrubby for Christmas. Not even themed. Just random browns, greens, pinks, and yellows… seems like the boss bought dollar store multi-packs and opened them to give everyone one piece. Nurses Week 2022 (height of Delta wave COVID). We were given rocks on a keychain. The rock was engraved with the word “Hope”. We might have gotten some chapstick too. New owners this year. Old owner gave us 10% of our salary as a year end bonus. New guys gave us $100 amazon cards that were drained by the time we got them. Everyone was pissed but didn’t wanna say anything so I did. He asked everyone and they claimed to be delighted with their cards. Spineless bastards. Lmao. – dankasaurus710 Company coffee mug with the company name misspelled. It was a large company. Teacher here. One year, as our Christmas bonus, we got a defective plastic keychain that read “I love teching!” Spelled exactly like that. Normally, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.. but after the s**t we had been through, with zero support from admin, s**t pay, disrespect, etc. the keychain set us all off. It was adding insult to injury. Like, not only is our “bonus” a keychain that didn’t even work (the hasp had no spring), but the spelling error meant that a) someone didn’t even check them when they arrived, and b) someone put them in every teacher mailbox without looking at them. Admin sent out an email that basically said turn your keychains back in so they could send them back and get corrected ones. So, adding insult to injury. I appreciated the sentiment, but all of us could’ve done without that. An ultra-religious self-help book so we could become less miserable, incompetent and immoral. During the pandemic, my partner’s company sent employees each an envelope through the mail with a sticker in it for some appreciation week I laughed so hard at that. It literally was a sticker that said “happy appreciation week”. A coin commemorating a billion dollars in sales. I was re-gifted a gift basket given to my boss by a client and he forgot to remove the card that was addressed to him. Starbucks gift card that had no money on it and they had no receipt for it. Not me but a coworker at last year’s raffle got a Nintendo DS cleaning kit. For a normal Nintendo DS, not even a 3DS. They aren’t being made anymore. A pack of 10 tissues at the onset of COVID. Expired food. My last job the company broke all sorts of financial records and gave everyone a very expensive glass thing with a decal of the refinery. Not only did it suck but all employees ended having to pay 75 dollars in taxes on it. So the ‘job well done’ cost 75 bucks. – Logic_rocks I used to work in a record shop in the UK and usually got a bottle of wine as a Christmas bonus. Then the company was bought by Virgin and our Christmas bonus was a copy of Richard Branson’s (Virgin’s CEO) autobiography. 5 dollar Subway gift card. My boss made me come in on an off day to pick up because, “she did not want me missing the company bonus”. I really wonder if our managers need how much was on the cards? We talked about it for months. A long sleeve denim shirt with the company logo in the front above one of the front pockets.. In Florida. Plus we couldn’t wear denim at work so the only time we’d be able to wear the company shirt is on our own time (not happening) or when we’d have dress down day (again not happening). When a coworker inquired where we could wear this since we can’t wear it to work they listed places (like a BBQ joint, the movies, etc.) and said we should be grateful since most places don’t give their employees gifts. It was a call center. Could’ve given a blanket (since it was cold in the center), travel mug, anything except a shirt we can’t wear. – jennabellie A compulsory invitation to the holiday party. Technically, I wasn’t required to attend but it was a career-killer if you didn’t. I had to spend money on a dress just for the party since I didn’t have anything that was suitable, so not only did it cost *me* money, but I had to spend a precious evening pretending I liked my coworkers. – Particular-Natural12 A pink slip. And I don’t mean lingerie. TableAssault: A pink slip (in the US anyway) can be a notice of termination of employment or the title to a vehicle. I’m guessing OP didn’t get a new car as a gift, so… got fired. – ElvinBishop A cheap plastic key ring with the company logo on it after working 16-hour days for months to win a massive contract. No overtime paid either. An email from the boss saying he is donating “on behalf of the company” to a charity he is a chairman of. At a company Christmas party they would raffle off prizes; one prize for each person. They guy in front of me won a Budweiser mini fridge with LED lights. The guy after me won a LG flat-screen TV. My prize? A Pepsi baseball hat with broken snaps. – startinearly The first company I worked for out of college gave everyone a “free turkey” around the holidays. It wasn’t really a free turkey, it was a $25 gift certificate to a grocery store that was inconvenient for 75% of the people working there. And $25 didn’t cover a turkey, of course. Turns out, the company owners had a stake in the store. – truthcopy A bottle of our restaurant’s “signature” steak sauce that no one really liked and that we all had free access to all day, every day at work. This was instead of the standard $100 cash bonus we normally got yearly. – LadyLixerwyfe Welcome back in office postcard after the pandemic work from home period. We’ve got it minutes after receiving termination letters. Like I was fully expecting it but still it was in a poor taste. – jivow Nothing. And I work for a giant company. Not surprised though. The MD of the company bought himself a boat ‘for the company’. We didn’t get a bonus that year. – Thisoneissfwihope Worked for FritoLay. Went to the corporate headquarters and in my hotel room was a bag of FritoLay snack, all expired. – Zeus2068123 Mike Primavera is a Chicago-based comedy writer even though he doesn't HAVE to work.

Title: 2026 Looks Like An Inflection Point For Schwab’s US REIT To Launch Higher | SCHH

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © VideoFlow / Shutterstock.com The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) has spent the last year treading water, down roughly 2% while investors waited for interest rates to cooperate. With the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.2% in mid-December and the Federal Reserve signaling a gradual path toward lower rates in 2026, SCHH sits at the inflection point where real estate transforms from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The single biggest macro force shaping SCHH’s 2026 trajectory is the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield. Real estate investment trusts compete directly with risk-free government bonds for income-seeking capital. When Treasuries yield 4% or more, a REIT paying 3.5% looks unattractive. But if rates drift toward the 3.0% to 3.5% range that BlackRock and other forecasters expect by late 2026, that same REIT dividend becomes compelling. Lower long-term rates trigger cap rate compression. Property values move inversely to interest rates because the discount rate used to value future cash flows declines. A warehouse generating steady rental income becomes worth more when buyers can finance acquisitions at 4% instead of 6%. For SCHH, which holds industrial REITs like Prologis (NYSE:PLD) at nearly 9% of the portfolio, this valuation lift flows directly through to net asset value. The commercial real estate maturity wall is equally critical. Roughly $162 billion in CRE loans mature in 2026, up 56% from 2025’s $104 billion. Much of this debt was originated at 3% to 4% rates and needs refinancing. If rates stay elevated near 6%, refinancing becomes punishing and dividends get cut. If rates fall toward 4%, the crisis becomes manageable. SCHH’s fate hinges on this refinancing environment because its holdings must either roll over debt or tap equity markets at reasonable costs. Beyond macro rates, SCHH’s micro story centers on sector allocation within its 165 holdings. The fund’s largest position, Welltower (NYSE:WELL) at 9.84%, has surged over 50% year-to-date, demonstrating that healthcare REITs can thrive even in tough rate environments due to demographic tailwinds. But data center REITs like Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR), representing 4.1% of SCHH, have fallen 14% this year as AI infrastructure euphoria faded and financing costs bit harder. This divergence matters because SCHH’s 2026 performance depends on which subsectors catch momentum. Infrastructure REITs including cell towers and data centers comprise roughly 18% of the portfolio. Industrial and logistics properties add another 15%. Residential REITs account for 12%. The Fidelity MSCI Real Estate Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FREL) offers a similar portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.084% versus SCHH’s 0.07%. FREL holds $1.1 billion in assets with nearly identical top holdings including Welltower, Prologis, and American Tower. The key difference is FREL includes real estate services companies like CBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) at 3.26% and CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) at 1.98%, which aren’t REITs but benefit from real estate transaction volumes. If the rate environment improves and property sales accelerate in 2026, FREL captures that upside through its services exposure while SCHH remains pure-play property ownership. The most important signal for SCHH over the next 12 months is whether the 10-year Treasury yield breaks below 4% and stays there, combined with whether the fund’s industrial and healthcare REIT holdings maintain occupancy and rental growth despite the refinancing wave.

Investing Nvidia is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. Sending You to Google News in 3 © lupmotion / Shutterstock.com After gaining $6.85 on Friday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up another $3.25 in premarket. The tech giant is still riding the AI story, and a recent Barclays upgrade to a buy rating, thanks to the likelihood of more AI spending. “We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Technically, after finding triple bottom support dating back to September, NVDA is now challenging resistance at its 50-day moving average. However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next. Plus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research. After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher. From its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation. On her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post. After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron (NASDAQ: MU) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket. While Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI. As we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.

Title: Monthly Pay ETFs Go Mainstream And Retirees LOVE Them

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St I opened the conversation by admitting something most investors eventually confront. There are products in the market that sound intriguing, but you are not entirely sure how they work. Monthly pay ETFs fall squarely into that category for many people. Lee stepped in to explain why they have quietly become one of the most useful income tools available today. Lee started with the basics. Exchange traded funds trade intraday, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds that settle at the end of the day. What surprised many income investors over the past decade is that while most ETFs originally paid dividends quarterly, a growing group now pays monthly. For retirees, boomers, and older Gen X investors, that distinction matters far more than it sounds. Lee pointed to JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) Equity Premium Income ETF, symbol JEPI, as the most widely recognized example. With roughly $30 billion in assets, JEPI pays a monthly yield north of 8%. While it does experience some volatility during broader market drawdowns, Lee noted that income-focused investors continue to support it because consistent cash flow is the primary objective. We also discussed more specialized options. One that stood out was the Gabelli Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (NYSE: GGN). Managed by Mario Gabelli’s firm, it holds a mix of gold and energy stocks, effectively pairing two sectors that often perform well during inflationary or volatile environments. GGN pays a monthly dividend above 8%, making it attractive for investors who want sector exposure alongside income. Another higher-yield option Lee mentioned was BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II (NYSE: BSTZ), a technology-oriented income fund paying monthly distributions exceeding 11%. These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

Title: AMZU Let’s You Bet 200% On Amazon But That Doesn’t Mean You Should

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Direxion Daily AMZN Bull 2X Shares (NYSEARCA:AMZU) offers 200% daily exposure to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but its mechanics reveal why it’s designed for short-term traders, not income investors. Understanding how AMZU generates distributions and its structural risks is critical before investing. AMZU doesn’t generate income through traditional dividends. It uses derivatives, swaps, and daily rebalancing to achieve 200% exposure to Amazon’s daily price movements. When Amazon pays a dividend, AMZU receives the distribution amplified through leverage, but at significant cost. The ETF paid a $1.20 special dividend in December 2025, but this must be evaluated against substantial NAV erosion from volatility decay. The fund holds only 13.57% in direct Amazon equity, with the remainder in derivatives for daily 2x leverage. This structure resets leverage daily, creating compounding drag that destroys long-term returns even when the underlying stock performs well. While Amazon declined 1.64% over the past year, AMZU lost 23.15% – nearly 20 percentage points beyond what 2x leverage predicts. The S&P 500 gained 12.63% and the Nasdaq-100 surged 20.70% over the same period. Year-to-date through December 2025, Amazon gained 3.63%, which should theoretically produce a 7.26% return for AMZU. Instead, the fund lost 13.99% – a 21-percentage-point shortfall from volatility decay. This occurs because daily resets lock in losses during choppy markets. When Amazon drops 2% one day and rises 2% the next, AMZU doesn’t return to breakeven due to compounding effects. Recent volatility illustrates the problem. In December 2025, Amazon experienced multiple 3-4% daily swings, with intraday ranges exceeding $7. On December 17, the stock dropped 4.4%. These moves amplify decay as AMZU rebalances derivatives at the worst times. While AMZU’s $1.20 special dividend might seem attractive, total return matters more. High yield means nothing if the ETF price collapses. Since inception in September 2022, AMZU has consistently underperformed its theoretical 2x target during volatile periods. Amazon’s fundamentals remain strong—Q3 2025 revenue of $180.2 billion and net income of $21.2 billion both beat estimates. AWS sales grew 20%, and the company maintains 24.3% return on equity with a healthy balance sheet. However, these positives don’t translate to AMZU performance due to daily resets. The ETF’s $321.5 million in assets and limited three-year track record provide insufficient data for long-term distribution patterns. The structure guarantees volatility will erode returns over extended periods, making dividend sustainability irrelevant when capital losses exceed income received. For leveraged technology exposure without single-stock concentration risk, ProShares UltraPro QQQ (NASDAQ:TQQQ) offers better diversification. TQQQ provides 3x daily exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index, including Amazon alongside 99 other leading technology companies. TQQQ generates income from dividends across the entire Nasdaq-100. The fund’s $24 billion asset base and track record since 2010 provide more reliable performance data. While TQQQ still suffers from volatility decay inherent to leveraged ETFs, diversification across 100 stocks creates smoother daily movements than AMZU’s single-stock concentration. For tactical traders seeking short-term leveraged exposure, TQQQ’s broader base and deeper liquidity make it more practical than betting 200% on Amazon alone.

‘Tis the season for “biggest story of the year” articles and, when it comes to crypto, the choice in 2025 was not hard. The obvious pick is Wall Street’s full-on embrace of crypto, which saw banks and big companies tripping over each other to show they are down with stablecoins and tokenized assets. But look a little closer and you’ll see 2025 featured another major, but more subtle, trend: the ongoing expansion of DeFi and decentralized technology. This has been reflected in the huge growth of DeFi platforms like Hyperliquid, and in Coinbase’s decision last week to add Jupiter, a leading aggregator for decentralized Solana trading, to its app. Such developments have helped decentralized exchanges nab a bigger share of overall crypto trading volume, with degens now accounting for a double digital share of the spot trading market. The CEO of Maple Finance, one of the leading players in the decentralized space, this week went so far as to claim “DeFi is dead”—implying that on-chain trading has become so big that it is poised to swallow conventional systems altogether. I wouldn’t go that far (at least not for a few years), but you get the point. The CEO’s remark also highlights how, in coming years, we are likely to face confusion over what exactly the term decentralized means. For longtime blockchain enthusiasts, the term implies using blockchain technology to build more democratic alternatives to powerful institutions—including big banks, but also the likes of Google and Facebook. But if this is the promise of crypto, what should we make of JPMorgan and BlackRock launching new on-chain money market funds available to those with $5 million or more to trade?It’s a win, of course, that blockchain technology has proved so good that the most respected names in traditional finance are using it. Still, it’s hard to get excited about giant corporations using blockchains to sling commercial paper when the original goal was to democratize large sections of society and the economy. The situation is reminiscent of the quip: “They promised us flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Coinbase offers stock trading: The company says its move into equities will let it be a bridge to the era of tokenization. Coinbase also launched prediction markets in a tie-up with Kalshi, intensifying its head-to-head competition with Robinhood. (Fortune) Here come the big banks: The country’s eight largest banks are putting tens of millions into a new non-profit that will “tell the banking industry’s story”—a clear response to crypto firms’ mass lobbying efforts, and one that could complicate the push for new blockchain legislation. (Axios) North Korea’s record haul: The Hermit Kingdom’s notorious military-backed hackers out did themselves in 2025, stealing a record $2 billion in crypto—the lion’s share of the estimated $3.4 billion stolen overall. (Fortune) PayPal’s hard path: The fintech giant’s CEO told Fortune his company is facing a “very classic innovator’s dilemma” as it doubles down on crypto and stablecoins to try to keep pace with competitors. (Fortune) Bitcoin OGs still selling: Longtime Bitcoin holders keep off-loading their positions, which helps explain ongoing pressure on prices. The move may not signal a loss of confidence, but rather a sign of the market maturing as one-time HODLers take advantage of new liquidity supplied by ETFs and institutional funds. (Bloomberg) Caroline Ellison is back in the news after the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund was released from federal prison. Her onetime boyfriend, meanwhile, still faces decades of hard time. The feds arrested a Brooklyn man for impersonating a Coinbase staffer in order to steal $16 million from around 100 traders. The suspect’s “lolimfeelingevil” alias probably won’t help at his sentencing hearing.

Share this article BlackRock sent 2,019 Bitcoin worth approximately $182 million and 29,928 Ethereum worth around $91 million to Coinbase Prime on Monday, according to blockchain data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. Markets tend to pay close attention to the firm’s on-chain movements, which frequently are followed by large flows later in the day or in subsequent sessions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs saw over $240 million in net outflows last week, while its Ethereum funds shed roughly $558 million without a single day of positive flows, per Farside Investors. Crypto investment products lost $952 million in capital last week. The downturn ended a four-week streak of inflows, largely due to $555 million exiting Ethereum funds and $460 million from Bitcoin funds. After dipping below $85,000 late last week, Bitcoin rebounded past $90,000 ahead of today’s US market open. The recovery boosted sentiment across the board, lifting the total crypto market cap by 1.5% to $3.1 trillion in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: AI layoffs in 2025: Over 55,000 US job cuts are linked to arrival of artificial intelligence – here's list of companies

Layoffs have been a major concern in the job market in 2025 as several major companies announced significant job cuts amid the growing use of artificial intelligence. This year alone, AI has led to almost 55,000 layoffs in the US, according to a report by CNBC citing consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In 2025, total job cuts reached 1.17 million, the highest since 2020, when 2.2 million layoffs were announced. US employers reported 153,000 job cuts in October, and over 71,000 cuts occurred in November, with AI responsible for more than 6,000 of these layoffs, the report said. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report in November, noting that AI can already replace 11.7% of the US labour market and save up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. However, some experts disagree that AI is the primary cause of the significant job cuts. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC that it could be just an excuse. Stephany mentioned that many companies which did well during the pandemic “significantly overhired," and the recent layoffs could simply be a “market clearance”. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long-term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,’” he added. Check out the companies that announced AI-linked layoffs — The tech giant announced its largest-ever layoffs, cutting 14,000 corporate jobs to focus on its “biggest bets”, including AI. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs by 2025, with its latest announcement in July signalling 9,000 roles to be eliminated. In a memo to employees, CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that the company must' reimagine” its mission for a new era' and highlighted the importance of AI for the company's future, the report noted. “What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve,” Nadella was quoted as saying. In September, CEO Marc Benioff announced that the company had laid off 4,000 customer support staff, utilising AI, the report said. “I’ve reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,” Benioff said in an interview on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast. Benioff stated over the summer that AI was already managing up to 50% of the company's work. CEO Arvind Krishna told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots had replaced the jobs of a few hundred human resources workers. Unlike other companies, which cited AI as a reason for job cuts, Krishna, however, noted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. The company announced a 1% reduction in its global workforce in November, which is expected to affect approximately 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike announced in May that it is laying off 5% of its staff, amounting to 500 employees, citing AI as the direct reason for the cuts. “AI has always been foundational to how we operate,” the report quoted co-founder and CEO George Kurtz's memo. “AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” Human resources platform Workday in February announced it would cut 8.5% of its workforce, roughly 1,750 jobs, as the company increases its investment in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach stated that the layoffs were necessary to focus on AI investments and to free up resources.

Title: Quite a few of the AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were actually ex-employees

20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were ex-employees When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google is re-hiring a number of ex-employees to help boost its AI strategy, a new CNBC report states, claiming one in five AI software engineer hires were so-called 'boomerang' employees. Not only is this figure up from previous years, but Google also claims to be hiring more workers from rival companies (like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple) than ever before. "We're energized by our momentum, compute and talent – engineers want to work here to keep building groundbreaking products," a company spokesperson shared. Data published by ADP Research confirms 'boomerang' hiring, where companies regain former assets (including from periods spent at rival companies), is on the rise, and has been since 2022. This trend is amplified within the information sector, while other sections like leisure and hospitality, health and construction see fewer returning employees. Google also has a large pool of alumni to pick from after cutting around 12,000 workers in early 2023, plus hundreds more in smaller rounds of layoffs. When ChatGPT hit the ground running in November 2022, rival companies like Google were left stunned, but recent years have seen Google in particular step up to the mark. The company recently launched Gemini 3, and with it "a new era of intelligence." The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly users, but it still lags behind OpenAI's 800 million weekly ChatGPT users. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Still, investors are happy with the work Google is doing. Company shares are up 62% this year to date. On the flip side, Google isn't the only company poaching AI talent. Apple recently announced that 16-year Google veteran Amar Subramanya would be joining Apple as VP of AI following John Giannandrea's departure.

Title: I was laid off by Oracle 2 years ago and still can't find a job. I've blown through my savings and now sell antiques to stay afloat.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This "as-told-to" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go. I didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024. I was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape. More than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position. I earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle. In addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary. When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.

Read more on the topic: In my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday. When I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology. After graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara. I took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll. At the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral. My pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile. My job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office. I've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on "Jeopardy!" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role. My family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a "just-in-case" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left. A few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business. I would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan. My business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods. It's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging. I'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story. Before I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection. If I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations. Jump to

Title: Crypto Exec Warns Tokenization Is Moving Faster Than Expected

According to a post shared on X by Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments firm MoonPay, finance is heading toward an onchain future that could unfold over several years. The view comes as large banks and asset managers begin product tokenization, a move that once seemed extreme but is now being treated as a practical step by major institutions. Based on reports cited by Grossman, progress has accelerated because rules are becoming clearer. Legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, bank involvement and accounting standards are starting to line up. That combination reduces uncertainty, which is often what slows large pools of capital. BlackRock has already launched tokenized funds, while Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Those actions suggest that tokenization is no longer confined to pilot labs or internal trials. It is being used with real assets and real clients. Bank of America recently said that banks are heading toward a multi-year, onchain future. A few years ago, that would have sounded radical. Today, it sounds inevitable. 20+ years ago, I began my career in media and saw firsthand what happens when an analog industry collides with… — Keith A. Grossman (@KeithGrossman) December 21, 2025 Banks are also taking part. Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have all been linked to onchain settlement tests, tokenized deposits and near real-time asset transfers. These projects focus on reducing friction in back-end processes that have existed for decades. Settlement that once took days could be shortened to minutes if shared ledgers are used. That change alone alters how risk, liquidity and cost are managed across markets. Grossman framed the moment as similar to earlier shifts in other industries. He pointed to how legacy media struggled when distribution moved online more than 20 years ago. At the time, many firms tried to protect old revenue streams instead of adapting. Some survived by changing early. Others lost influence as new platforms took control. In finance, the pressure point sits in areas such as reconciliation, clearing, settlement and custody. These roles have long supported steady margins, partly because they depend on complex and slow systems. Reports have disclosed that software and shared protocols can now handle much of that work. As a result, some services may become cheaper and less profitable over time. That does not mean banks disappear. According to Grossman’s view, they remain central players, much like they did after ATMs reduced teller roles or when voice-over-internet systems cut long-distance call costs for telecom firms. The institutions stayed, but their shape changed. The same pattern is expected here. Banks may rely more on software, fewer manual steps and new forms of infrastructure control. Tokenization is moving faster than expected, according to MoonPay president Keith Grossman. Banks and asset managers are testing tokenized funds and onchain settlement, signaling that what was once experimental is now becoming practical. The lenders and other big players are among the firms pushing the shift, showing the trend is already under way.

Title: Ripple’s RLUSD Breaks Into Top 5 Stablecoins As It Marks Its One-Year Anniversary
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-rlusd-breaks-into-top-5-stablecoins-as-it-marks-its-one-year-anniversary/
Time Published: 2025-12-22T08:34:55Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s RLUSD has marked its first anniversary, rising to the top five stablecoins and securing regulatory approvals across the globe. In the coming years, the team has its sights set on challenging the dominance of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, capitalizing on a streak of regulatory wins. RLUSD, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Ripple, has marked its first anniversary, notching impressive numbers in under 12 months. Launched on December 17, 2024, the RLUSD has inched its way into conversations for leading stablecoins. According to Standard Custody CEO Jack McDonald, Ripple has joined the top five stablecoins, reaching the milestone in “record time.” While not expressly stated, McDonald’s comments in an X post refer to the category of US-regulated stablecoins, specifically those with OCC and NYDFS licenses. Under this subset, Ripple’s RLUSD ranks in third place behind Circle’s USDC and PayPal’s PYUSD with market capitalizations of $78 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. One year after launch, Ripple’s market capitalization sits at $1.3 billion, making it “one of the fastest climbs in the regulated stablecoin space.” “I’m excited to celebrate the one-year anniversary of RLUSD,” said McDonald. “We’ve gone from 0 to a top 5 USD stablecoin in record time.” However, CoinMarketCap data ranks RLUSD eighth by market capitalization, including both US-regulated and offshore stablecoins. Apart from its frenetic surge over one year, RLUSD racked up impressive milestones along the way. Right off the bat, the OCC’s conditional approval of Ripple’s National Trust Bank charter puts RLUSD in pole position for regulatory compliance. To cement its place in the enterprise market, Ripple tapped BNY Global to custody RLUSD reserves and enlisted Deloitte for attestations as an added layer of credibility. Outside the US, RLUSD has received regulatory approvals in key jurisdictions such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All year long, RLUSD has been cementing its place as a major bridge for real-world assets (RWA). The stablecoin offers BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenised funds with a 24/7 off-ramp, extending its institutional use case. Meanwhile, plans for multichain expansion are underway with Ripple pursuing interoperability on Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain. “It was undeniably the year of the stablecoin, and I can’t wait to see what 2026 has in store,” said McDonald.

When it comes to highlighting shocking customer care in Ireland and the myriad ways readers have been let down, this page is rarely found wanting. But with it being the season of goodwill and all, we thought we might suspend our giving out for one day and instead celebrate all the soundness we’ve come across in recent times. Here are just some of the stories people have shared with us across social media platforms and via email since the start of this month. One thing that strikes us (and not for the first time) is how little it costs – in financial terms – to go above and beyond and how potentially great the returns are for businesses and people who do right by their customers. One reader, Elva, got in touch to sing the praises of All Seasons Flowers in Lucan Shopping Centre, Co Dublin. “At the beginning of November I placed an online order for a fresh door wreath and a Christmas table arrangement, with collection scheduled for Saturday, December 6th,” she said. “When I arrived, the team realised there had been a mix-up and they had prepared two wreaths instead of the wreath and the table arrangement. “They apologised profusely and immediately refunded the cost of the table arrangement.” She is undergoing cancer treatment and had been driven quite a distance to the shop by her partner as she had recently had surgery, which meant returning another day was not really an option. “I accepted the refund without any issue. However, the following day, Sunday 7th, I received a genuinely thoughtful email from the owner Emily Gaynor, apologising for the oversight and explaining it fell short of the standard they aim for, especially for orders placed well in advance for Christmas. “As a gesture of goodwill, she insisted on creating the table arrangement free of charge and arranging delivery to my home. It arrived today and it’s beautiful. “For a small business to go to such lengths after having already refunded me speaks volumes about their integrity and commitment to their customers. “In a time when good service can often feel rare, All Seasons Flowers in Lucan really stood out.” Niamh contacted us to praise the Christmas-tree sellers outside the Tesco in Newbridge, Co Kildare. “My 75-year-old mum couldn’t make the Christmas tree stand on her own, so they went up and put up the tree for her as well free of charge. I thought that was really sweet.” [ ‘Regift the bejaysus out of it’: 21 tips for a cheaper Christmas, from readers and from us ] Gina, meanwhile, had kind words for Clarkes Bakery in Cabra, Dublin, although it is more of a story of kindness on the double, really. “My husband was recently in the Mater recovering after a heart bypass,” she says. “He heard one of the nurses was celebrating a big birthday, but had to work over the next few days and wasn’t going to get out to celebrate,” she said. So Gina’s husband called Clarkes. “He ordered a large birthday cake and had planned for a taxi to collect it and deliver it to the hospital – on the phone with the bakery when everything was ordered they told him that they are a cash-only business. “But they took the order and delivered the cake on the basis that when he was out he would call in and pay for it. Of course, he couldn’t drive for weeks and when I called in to pay it was ... no big fuss. “Such a lovely kind thing and amazing customer service. They deserve a big shout-out.” Fiona had two stories to share: one from times past and another from recent days. When she was a student about 17 years ago she was getting the Bus Éireann service to Limerick from Galway to visit an aunt. “I lost my ticket and needed to get on the bus. I was really flustered and nervous. I was too broke to get a new ticket and the bus driver saw me looking anxious. When he came over to me, my face was so flushed and I explained that I lost my ticket,” she said. “He must have felt sorry for me and told me he saw me buying a ticket, which I doubted because he had just got off another bus. He said it was OK, took my bag, put it in the luggage area and told me to go on to the bus. “I was so embarrassed and grateful that I welled up when I sat down. I couldn’t believe his kindness.” Fast forward to 2025 and she has another transport story to share, this time involving Aer Lingus. “I was on an Aer Lingus flight and the woman in front of me looked so stressed. She was flying on her own with a baby and a toddler. When the flight took off, the baby kept crying and mother looked increasingly flustered,” Fiona wrote. “Later, she was trying to hold the crying baby with one hand and unzip her bag to get something for the toddler with the other hand. “The air hostess came over with a broad smile and asked if she could take the baby for a while. “She picked up the baby, kept her close to her chest, started rocking her and cooing her for about half an hour. The baby stopped crying and the mother looked so relieved and grateful. “It was lovely witnessing an act of kindness that meant so much to someone in a state of stress and anxiety. “I always find Aer Lingus have brilliant customer service and it’s not the first time I’ve witnessed an act of kindness from their staff.” Margaret, meanwhile, recently had to email Spotlight Oral Care as her toothbrush of less than a year old gave up. “I got an email requesting some details and short video of the toothbrush,” she writes. “I sent the requested info and the next email was to confirm replacement on way. It was so efficient and all within a matter of a few days. Excellent customer service.” We are big fans of the Saw Doctors on this page, so were delighted when the band – or at least someone acting on their behalf – got a shout out. “My wife and I recently brought our 14-year-old son to his first music gig – the Saw Doctors in the Olympia,” Shane wrote. “Our son hadn’t been in the theatre before so when we got in, we brought him down to the front of the standing area so he could look up and back at all the levels and boxes and see how fantastic a venue it is.” As it happens, there was a section cordoned off at the very front where they restrict numbers standing close to the stage. “As we went to make our way back into the general standing area, the floor manager (we think) came over to us and gave us wristbands so we could stand in the priority area at the front, where it would be less crowded and more suitable for our son,” Shane says. “As if that wasn’t enough, the floor manager then sought us out and came over to present our son with one of the handwritten set lists from the band to keep as a memento of his first gig. “I believe his name was Tommy K (apparently a coincidence that it was one of the Saw Doctors songs on the night) – he certainly deserves a shout-out for going above and beyond unprompted on the night.” Grainne from Galway recently needed some ties for her outdoor Christmas lights, so called to O’Higgins in Shantalla. She told the sales assistance what she needed “and he could not have been nicer. He brought me out to a big stockroom at the back of the shop. He went through all the options and said, ‘While these may not be what you are looking for, they will work’. I decided on tile clips, which did the job. “I just want to call out the time, the interest and how helpful this gentleman was. The sale came to €5, so it wasn’t as if I was a big customer with a large order, but he still gave me the time and showed interest.” She also praises Blackthorn Candles and Blazer Candles, two Galway candle companies. “I ordered candles from both above candlemakers in Galway to shop local. The candles from both places were really good quality and well made with a lovely scent. To my surprise both gentlemen arrived at my front door and delivered them personally. “Great service, great candles, great to support local companies.” Staying with fragrances, Paddy wrote in about “a small business called Handsome Scent on Stephen Street in Dublin. They do home-produced fragrances (with “inspiration-from”) some of the higher-priced shop ones. “I bought a set of three fragrances and one of them had leaked in the post. I sent a message on Instagram and they posted a new one that day and I had it the next day. “No messing, quibbles, just really good service.” [ 100 Irish websites for all your Christmas presents, from Claddagh Guinness socks to cheese ] Ciara Kelly – the one on the radio – also got in touch to highlight how a cold Christmas was once averted by the soundness of Ultima Oil in Kilpedder, Co Wicklow. She ran out of home heating oil on Christmas Eve and tells us she “left a message on Ultima Oil’s answering machine (they were finished up for Christmas) asking if we could get a delivery as soon as they reopened. “We went out for lunch and came home to a full tank they had delivered on Christmas Eve afternoon so we wouldn’t be cold. They said we could pay after Christmas. It was unbelievably kind,” Ciara said. She actually has a second story of goodwill. “Another Christmas, it was a week to go and Greystones butcher Des Doyle rang me to say I hadn’t ordered a turkey and no problem if I’d ordered elsewhere, but just in case I’d forgotten he was checking as it was the last chance to get one. I hadn’t ordered elsewhere and Des Doyle saved Christmas.” Last January reader PJ bought an air fryer from Harvey Norman in Rathfarnham, Dublin. “A couple of weeks ago it started to switch off halfway through the cycle. It was still under warranty, so they asked me to bring it in so they could have a look at it,” he says. “The unit was taken away and five minutes later the sales assistant returned with a replacement. The paperwork was sorted in minutes and she put it on a trolley and followed me out to the car. That’s what I call customer service.” Another reader, Richard, says: “There’s the best of small bookshops in Blackrock in Dublin called Raven Books. Louisa runs it and she’s an absolute gem. Helpful, knowledgeable, affable, dedicated, hard working. She’s just brilliant. “But best of all, and although some time ago now, she delivered books on her bicycle to my three kids to the door during Covid, when things were closed. They were utterly delighted by it. “I haven’t bought a book anywhere else since. She more than deserves a mention.” We also heard from a reader called Doreen, who got in touch to praise Global Windows. “The attention to detail, professionalism, courtesy and reliability is way beyond any other company/contractor who worked on our house refurbishment,” she says. “Every single contact I had from the initial sales person to the guys actually fitting the windows were a pleasure to deal with.” [ Beware the ghost of “Buy Now Pay Later” and have a savvy Christmas ] Next up is Ciara, who says she had “some niggly adult-life stuff happen recently and it always really helps when a) people are sound and b) people do what they say they are going to do”. Ciara has three good news stories to share. “During the summer, a large and heavily filled plate drawer under the hob of our fitted kitchen (new house, only three years old) locked while pulled out and refused to close,” she says. “I was away at the time and messaged the original kitchen fitter and supplier, Stuart Malcolm from Onovo. I got a quick text back from him and he confirmed he was out my way and could have a quick look. “He not only fixed the drawer, he confirmed it wasn’t overloaded by weight/amount of plates/bowls etc and continued his way around all the units adjusting the bin drawer and larder press. “Just good workmanship and he refused to take any payment. He was just sound.” That was not the only issue she had with her three-year-old kitchen. Her oven died and she went to Worrells/Expert in Malahide, Co Dublin, where she got “loads of advice and patience from Paul while we considered reconfiguring our oven(s) set-up – amending cabinetry. We didn’t in the end. “After admiring the workings of our brand new oven, I noticed the above fitted microwave door wasn’t closing properly and while he hadn’t moved it during the installation process the same guy came back to tweak the microwave for me free of charge.” And finally she tells us about “an absolute head-the-ball teenager [who] came in the exit gate of my local Dart station on a e-scooter with a girlfriend on the back, dressed in black and with no lights doing at least 30/40kph. “He screamed abuse so loud at me for bumping over his scooter, with such loud cursing that my husband left the platform and saw him leave the scene again, at speed on his scooter all at 7.30am in the dark while my car went into limp mode with sensors beeping and €1,300 worth of damage to the wheel arch, front bumper etc.” The car was repaired by “the lovely lads at Trimtech Santry who said this was a regular occurrence (and interestingly, a lot of parents were paying cash for the damage done by their unlit, uninsured and unregistered e-scooting teenagers – that’s a whole other article). “Picked up car, repaired and fully washed and fully internally valeted – so sound.” To finish, we have some shorter stories shared by users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Meadbh had a “recent interaction with Virgin Media for TV and broadband. Admitted to the billing error straight up and rectified the situation straight away. People I spoke with were absolutely sound also.” Julie says: “I think Tesco Mobile deserve the recognition for their excellent customer service. I’m with them several years and any issues I’ve ever had were sorted nearly immediately with the utmost professionalism. Their customer service is fantastic.” David applied to renew his passport on a Thursday morning “and it arrived next morning”. You can’t beat that. Denise had praise for Bloomfield Garage on Dublin’s South Circular Road. “I rang them in a panic about warning light on the dashboard of an imported hybrid. My husband was just admitted to hospice, so I was already very emotional. The owner, Paul, said, ‘Right, come in and we’ll have a look’. It was only battery in key fob, but his kindness made my day.” Our weekly personal finance newsletter will give you the insight you need to save money and make smart spending decisions © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SEC to Open Floodgates for Dual Share Classes

The agency granted approval to dozens of providers last week but reserved the right to bring future hearings. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The Securities and Exchange Commission finally brought dual share classes to the masses … some of them, anyway. The SEC announced last week that it will allow dozens of issuers to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds and vice versa, so long as the SEC doesn’t order hearings against the applications. The move is the agency’s first announcement on the topic since November, when it approved Dimensional Fund Advisors’s proposal. Despite being largely expected, experts said the decision underscores the ongoing ETF boom and the expectation that ETF adoption by traditional money managers will increase. “Managers who were traditionally not in the ETF space, are now very much so in the ETF space,” said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. “Approval for the share class [is] really going to be a huge igniter … It helps these managers get access to a channel that maybe they’ve not traditionally been in.” The primary benefits of a dual-share-class structure include tax efficiency and liquidity, as the benefits of an ETF wrapper are brought to mutual fund structures, and potentially to retirement accounts. But it won’t all be smooth sailing from here, Lee said, since many logistical and operational hurdles remain for traditional managers who haven’t had to learn the ins and outs of ETFs before. “[Some managers] may not be as familiar, or may not have direct firsthand experience with in-kind custom baskets,” he said, referring to how issuers can create baskets of securities and transfer them directly to whoever is redeeming shares, thus reducing taxes. “That’s going to be something managers are going to have to get comfortable with. It’s a new tool in their arsenal.” While larger managers likely have existing products or the resources in-house, smaller money managers may have to rely on the expertise of others to get their funds off the ground, he added. According to the SEC’s notice: Solid, Gas, Liquidity. Liquidity will be something to watch, Lee said, since many of these funds need to hold more cash or other liquid assets, which could cause an increase in underlying fees. “There’s more listed tickers for ETFs out there in the marketplace than there are actual single stock tickers,” he said. “It will be interesting to see what the impact of this influx of active managers doing custom in-kind baskets … has for balance sheets.” Allocations will go toward companies that exhibit favorable future estimates of cash flow, earnings per share, price targets and sales. Its two diversified bond ETFs can’t match the private-credit allocations of less-liquid vehicles, but they are beating 92% of peers. Avantis Investors reached the asset milestone during a big year of growth and a legal proceeding over naming rights. There are 11 ETFs with over 5% of assets allocated to the stock. But most assets are held in gigantic funds with small exposures. Unit investment trust no more, Invesco’s massive ETF will see revenue directed away from marketing — something the company has long wanted. With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. © 2025 The Daily Upside

PHOTO: CK HUTCHISON HOLDINGS LIMITED Published Dec 22, 2025, 09:03 AM Updated Dec 22, 2025, 08:28 PM HONG KONG - Mr Li Ka-shing and his family set in motion a series of deals in 2025 that stand to completely transform his business empire. a series of deals in 2025 The Hong Kong billionaire’s flagship conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings, is pursuing three major moves: an initial public offering of its retail arm to raise at least US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) for its largest revenue contributor; a potential listing or partial sale of its global telecommunications operations; and talks to sell 43 port assets – representing the bulk of its global portfolio for more than US$19 billion in cash. The Li family, which controls about 30 per cent of CK Hutchison, believes selling and spinning off these businesses can unlock far greater value than the market currently assigns to them under the existing structure, a person familiar with the plans said. By separating the assets, the family hopes to fetch higher prices and narrow the steep discount at which the company trades relative to its net asset value. If CK Hutchison completes all these deals, it would have shed or spun off most of its core operating businesses, handing Mr Li’s elder son Victor Li – who now chairs the group – a fresh war chest to reshape the company in an era defined by trade tensions and technological disruption, including the rise of artificial intelligence. “The Li family has accumulated massive wealth over the past decades,” said Mr Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “The most important thing for the family now is to make sure that the wealth is monetised and safeguarded.” The moves mark a generational shift for one of Hong Kong’s most storied business empires. Mr Li Ka-shing built CK Hutchison into the world’s leading port operator and a major player in European telecommunications, leveraging political connections and riding on global expansion. Mr Victor Li, who took over in 2018, faces the challenge of steering the group through a far more volatile environment, where geopolitical sensitivities and regulatory hurdles loom large. In his heyday, Mr Li Ka-shing’s wealth ballooned as Hong Kong grew into an international financial hub, capitalising on China’s opening to a world that embraced collaboration and deepening trade ties. His uncanny sense of timing led to the nickname “Superman”. He expanded aggressively abroad – buying ports in Panama, building mobile networks in Britain and operating oil plants in Canada. By the early 2000s, he had built his group into the world’s largest port operator and the biggest Asian investor in European telecommunications. But the landscape has changed since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power, tightening the state’s grip on the private sector and keeping once-powerful tycoons at arm’s length. In Hong Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing and his peers are viewed with growing scepticism by Beijing, while abroad, his perceived ties with China have raised suspicions and created political hurdles for his operations – many of which sit in highly regulated industries. The Li family has lately found itself on the wrong side of the politics. The 97-year-old billionaire, who once rubbed shoulders with China’s top leaders, has fallen out of favour with President Xi. Over the past decade, state media has criticised him for selling assets in China and for remarks seen as sympathetic to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy youth. Beijing’s anger over CK Hutchison’s planned ports sale was so intense that state-owned firms were instructed to pause dealings with the Li family. “Li’s empire was built on intricate political connections he developed in the past,” said Mr Lam. “That’s not easy for Victor to inherit, because the world’s and China’s political environments have changed drastically.” According to people familiar with the family’s thinking, geopolitics was not a factor in the decision to pursue these deals. The Lis believe that restructuring the portfolio is the most effective way to bolster value. But regardless of the family’s motivations, US-China rivalry may now be the biggest obstacle to realising their plans. Talks over the ports sale have slowed amid regulatory hurdles and uncertainty surrounding the buying consortium’s structure, particularly after CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations to appease Beijing’s sensitivities over the involvement of US investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations Meanwhile, deliberations on the potential listing of retail arm A.S. Watson Group have been on-again, off-again since 2013, hampered by market volatility, while telecoms mergers frequently encounter intense antitrust scrutiny. CK Hutchison has been advised to move more cautiously with deals due to the delicate geopolitical environment, and to notify Chinese regulators on the potential retail listing because it involves operations in the country, a source said. Still, the potential deals have helped reverse depressed market sentiment, narrowing steep trading discounts to net asset value and driving a 32 per cent stock surge in 2025 – outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index. While the Li family is divesting CK Hutchison, it has been increasing its holdings in property arm CK Asset Holdings, now owning a stake of about 49 per cent. The bulk of CK Asset’s projects are located in Hong Kong and mainland China. It also operates British brewer and pub chain Greene King. “The Li family is bold in selling assets when the price is right,” said Natixis senior economist Gary Ng. “The series of moves can be a build-up of cash for acquisitions, leading to a sector shift in the company.” CK Hutchison is not alone in rethinking strategy. With Hong Kong’s global status diminished amid China’s growing influence and rising trade barriers, other storied business groups are also reshaping themselves. Jardine Matheson Holdings, a British-rooted conglomerate in Hong Kong, has been taking measures to modernise its management and accelerate divestments. Controlled for generations by the Keswick family, the 193-year-old group in recent years dismantled its long-criticised cross-shareholding structure and appointed several executives with private equity backgrounds to its top management. Its property unit, Hongkong Land Holdings, aims to raise US$10 billion over the next decade through asset disposals and spin-offs. The company is transitioning from being an owner-operator to a long-term, engaged investor, Jardine’s executive chairman Ben Keswick said in a statement for the group’s 2024 earnings report. Quiddity Advisors analyst David Blennerhassett said: “Both Jardine and CK operate conglomerates with various listed subsidiaries – and arguably they both are being proactive in extracting value.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Title: Bessent pressures companies, wealthy Americans to help bankroll ‘Trump accounts’ as favor to the prez

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging America’s wealthy and large corporations to finance the administration’s Trump Account investment program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said Wednesday during a press conference on the initiative. “Given the amazing level of interest and the generous donations we have seen so far, I am confident we will see many more pouring in.” Trump accounts aim to give American citizens born from Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2028, an initial $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account. That money is intended to give newborns a starter fund by the time they turn 18. It was a key provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now known as the Working Families Tax Cut Act, that the president signed into law in July. Parents and guardians are permitted to donate up to $5,000 a year, and employees up to $2,500, until children become 18. With a limited long-term federal funding for Trump accounts, Bessent is urging large companies and America’s wealthy to step in and top off the nest egg before the program formally launches next summer. Earlier this month, Michael and Susan Dell committed to donating a massive $6.25 billion to the initiative, ensuring children aged 10 and under who were born before 2025 will get up to $250 in their accounts. Last week, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio announced he will donate $75 million to Trump accounts for children in his home state of Connecticut. Companies such as BlackRock, Charter Communications, Visa, Mastercard and Uber have similarly committed to making donations of their own. Bessent isn’t alone in seeking to nudge the private sector to step up. Earlier this month, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) inked a letter to the CEOs of every Fortune 1000 company pressing them to pony up. “By matching contributions for employees’ families, investing in the communities where you operate, or integrating these accounts into your philanthropic strategy, you can significantly enhance the impact of this historic initiative,” they wrote in the letter. Booker has long proposed setting up an investment account system for America’s youth, similar to Trump’s eponymous initiative. Meanwhile, Bessent is encouraging states to step up as well. “The administration has been working closely with a number of governors to determine the best way states can work with the federal government to expand access to Trump accounts,” Bessent revealed last week. “Thus far, 20 states are considering topping-up the accounts.” Advertisement

Title: Tokenization will disrupt finance faster than digital disrupted media: Crypto exec

Putting real-world assets onchain opens up new markets, increases capital velocity and democratizes access to finance, advocates say. Tokenization will transform the financial industry faster than digital technology disrupted legacy media, such as print newspapers, physical copies of music and other analog formats, according to Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments company MoonPay. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said, adding that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: Financial incumbents like Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others will continue to exist in a different form, Grossman said, much like media companies continued to exist after the shift to digital distribution in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which disrupted business models that worked for decades. Ultimately, the survivors and winners of the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance will be those companies that get ahead of the change and not those that attempt to stop the inevitable shift to a global financial system powered through blockchain rails, he said. Related: Wall Street’s $4 quadrillion backbone to roll out tokenized US Treasurys Tokenizing real-world assets carries several benefits, including enabling 24/7 access to markets, making asset classes global in scale, cheaper transaction costs through disintermediation, and lowering settlement times to minutes, instead of days. In September, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement on creating a regulatory framework to enable 24/7 capital markets. The financial system shifting to 24/7 trading represents a major departure from how traditional markets, which close on nights, weekends and holidays, currently operate. In December, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a settlement and clearing company that processed about $3.7 quadrillion in settlement volume in 2024, received approval from the SEC to start offering tokenized financial instruments. The DTCC plans to roll out tokenized assets in the second half of 2026, starting with US Treasuries and stock indexes.

Title: Why Nvidia maintains its moat and Gemini won’t kill OpenAI
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/21/nvidia-maintains-moat-gemini-wont-kill-openai/
Time Published: 2025-12-21T21:07:36Z

UPDATED 16:07 EST / DECEMBER 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer Two prevailing narratives have driven markets recently. The first is that Nvidia Corp.’s moat is eroding primarily thanks to graphics processing unit alternatives such as tensor processing units and other application-specific integrated circuits. The second is that Google LLC generally and its Gemini artificial intelligence model specifically is gaining share, will dominate AI search and ultimately beat OpenAI Group PBC. We believe both of these propositions are overstated and unlikely to materialize as currently envisioned by many. Specifically, our research indicates that Nvidia’s GB300 and the follow on Vera Rubin will completely reset the economics of AI, conferring continued advantage to Nvidia. Furthermore, Nvidia’s volume lead will make it the low cost producer and, by far, the most economical platform to run AI at scale – for both training and inference. As it pertains to Google, it faces, in our view, the ultimate innovator’s dilemma because its search is tightly linked to advertising revenue. If Google moves its advertising model to a chatbot-like experience, its cost to serve search queries goes up by 100 times. The alternative is to shift its business model toward a more integrated shopping experience. But this requires more than 10 blue links thrown at users. Rather, it mandates a new trust compact with its users and advertisers, which Google does not currently possess, even with Gemini’s recent success. Despite the criticisms of ChatGPT, OpenAI in our estimation is well on the way to disrupting today’s online experience by emphasizing trusted information over pushing ads. The bottom line is the two early catalyzers of the AI era, Nvidia and OpenAI remain in a strong position in our view. Though lots can change, the current narrative around these two firms is likely to change when GB300 adoption ramps. In this, our 300th Breaking Analysis, we set forth our thinking around what we believe is a misplaced narrative in the market. We’ll explain what we think the market is missing and why Nvidia’s forthcoming product lineup will reset the narrative. We’ll also look at the economics of search, large language models and chatbots and share why OpenAI, while facing many challenges (competition, commitments, uncertainty), is in a stronger position than many have posited; and why Google, though clearly a leader in AI, remains challenged to preserve what may be the greatest business in the history of the technology business. We believe the core issue with TPUs isn’t whether they’re “good” chips — they are. The issue in our view is broad-based architectural fit for the next phase of AI, where frontier-scale workloads are increasingly communication-heavy and bandwidth-hungry and require systems that can scale to very large clusters without collapsing under their own coordination overhead. In our assessment, TPUs were designed in an era when bandwidth was expensive and hard to deliver, and that design center shows up as models scale and workloads diversify. TPUs are well-suited for lower-bandwidth AI and have proven effective in production contexts such as search. They can do certain training well, and they’ve been associated with important early milestones. But as models get larger and the work becomes more distributed, our research indicates the TPU design runs into practical constraints on expansion and on the amount of bandwidth available within the architecture. In our view, that’s a key reason the TPU approach hasn’t become the broadly replicated blueprint across the industry. We believe leading frontier efforts increasingly demand an architecture optimized for high bandwidth and scale — the kind of system design that enables “GPU factories,” where very large numbers of accelerators can be connected and kept productively utilized. When we talk about the requirements for AI factories, we highlight below three key factors: In our view, architectures designed around higher-bandwidth, scalable interconnects are better aligned with those requirements. Our premise is that TPUs remain a single-vendor architecture with a topology that effectively forms pods — a tightly coupled unit presented as a single system. That approach was elegant for its time and echoed other historic designs (for example IBM Blue Gene, Cray) intended to solve the “how do we connect everything” problem. But we believe the limitations show up in two places: None of this makes TPUs irrelevant. In our opinion, TPUs remain extremely useful and attractive — particularly for more bounded workloads — but usefulness is not the same thing as being the dominant foundation for next-generation AI factories. And in our framework, it’s definitely not the platform that will erode Nvidia’s moat. We believe the popular storyline — “Model X is trained on TPUs, therefore TPUs are the future” — misses the reality. Our view is that some major model training has indeed leveraged TPUs, but the data points toward a mixed approach where GPU-class architectures become increasingly necessary for frontier-scale, communication-heavy work. Our research indicates there’s also a pragmatic factor. Specifically, when accelerators are constrained, it’s rational to push existing assets to their limits. In that context, using available TPUs aggressively is not a statement that TPUs are the end state — it’s an optimization under supply constraints. We’re not bearish on TPUs. They are mature, and the engineering behind them is impressive. But we believe Nvidia’s moat is reinforced by an end-to-end architecture designed for bandwidth, scale, and sustained utilization — the attributes that matter most as AI factories move from impressive single-system demos to large-scale production infrastructure. We believe the recent TPU enthusiasm is less about a structural shift away from Nvidia and more about the fact that volumes are constrained, demand is outstripping supply, and every hyperscaler is operating under scarcity. In this environment, buyers and builders will use whatever credible compute they can get — and that dynamic is amplifying the availability and capabilities of TPUs, as well as other alternatives. The biggest constraint our research points to right now is packaging capacity. CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) is a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. packaging technology that takes chiplets from the wafer and integrates them onto a substrate so they can be connected with very high-speed communication. In our view, this is foundational to modern AI systems that depend on fast movement between chips and across complex multichip architectures. The key point is that when CoWoS capacity is tight, it constrains the output of advanced AI accelerators regardless of how strong demand is. The chart above shows projected consumption across Nvidia, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and others — and importantly, it reflects all chips, not only AI chips. That matters because portions of the non-Nvidia consumption are serving other product categories and process needs. But the bottom line remains that AI chips are being governed by the same packaging bottleneck. In the data referenced, total CoWoS capacity expands materially over time with Nvidia locking up more than 60% of the volume: At the same time, the compute and system efficiency of the leading platforms improves as Nvidia transitions through architectural steps — from GB200 to GB300 and then Rubin — alongside improvements in switching and overall system design. In our opinion, the market should view these trends in tandem – that is, capacity increases, but so does the performance per system, which reinforces the economics for the vendors that can both secure volume and move fastest down the experience curve. The leading vendor, by far, in this scenario is Nvidia. We believe one of the most underappreciated points in the current narrative is that Nvidia has effectively pre-bought and securured meaningful CoWoS capacity. As a result, even as the pie expands, Nvidia is positioned to maintain significant share over the planning horizon discussed — with the projection that by 2027 it still holds roughly 61% of the referenced market. For AI chips specifically our estimate is that Nvidia will maintain closer to ~80% of the market. Our view is that share will be determined by unit economics. Our premise is that Nvidia has volume leadership and has locked up a critical bottleneck input, which will confer structural cost advantage and flywheel effects to the company. In a supply constrained environment, hyperscalers will pursue a blended strategy. In the case of Google, it will use TPUs where they fit, and GPUs where they’re required, to generally maximize access to any capable compute. We believe that’s what’s driving much of the current TPU buzz — not a belief that TPUs will broadly displace GPUs for frontier-scale, communication-heavy workloads. We also believe it’s unlikely that a major hyperscaler (Google in this case) will broadly sell its proprietary accelerators to direct competitors in a way that creates a real external market. Claims and rumors may circulate, but in our opinion the more plausible driver behind “TPUs in the wild” narratives is ecosystem pressure from partners (for example Broadcom) and Meta Platforms Inc. (looking for any advantage right now). In short, we don’t see this as a strategic decision by Google to become a true merchant silicon provider. We believe the most important takeaway from this segment is the connection between the following three factors: In our view, this combination positions Nvidia, with near term platforms like GB300 and especially Rubin, to become the low-cost producers of tokens versus alternatives — not simply because of peak performance claims, but because scale and secured capacity will translate into superior economics. We believe the market is in a phase where every credible AI vendor can sell everything they can build because supply is scarce. But our research indicates this will change as capacity catches up over the next couple of years. Historically, semiconductors tend to swing from undersupply to oversupply — timing this is hard, but our research suggests there is still meaningful runway, and that the near-term (including 2026) remains supply-constrained rather than surplus-driven. Net-net: TPUs are getting attention because the market supply is short. CoWoS is a core bottleneck. And Nvidia’s ability to lock up capacity and ride the experience curve reinforces both share and cost position as the cycle matures. In a recent investor podcast, Gavin Baker went deep into the economics of GPUs and TPUs. It’s worth listening to the entire conversion. We pulled a clip from that discussion, which succinctly articulates the pending economic shift coming in the near term. What follows is our assessment of that conversation blended with our premise: We believe the “low-cost producer” framing is critical, but it’s often misunderstood and not applied rigorously. In our view, being the low-cost producer has always mattered in scaled markets — the nuance is whether people mean unit cost, delivered price or economic margin structure. When viewed through that perspective, Google’s position as the current low-cost producer for AI chips is increasingly fragile as the stack shifts and as the economics of TPU/ASIC supply chains become more clear. Our research aligns with Gavin Baker’s narrative, which indicates Google has enjoyed meaningful cost advantages in parts of its AI stack and has leaned into that position by aggressively approaching the market. Google can “bomb” AI with low-cost capacity because when you can drive lower unit costs, you can push more supply into the market and press competitors on price and availability. But we believe that advantage is highly dependent on the underlying performance curve and the economics of the hardware supply chain — and both are moving. We believe one under-appreciated structural advantage for Nvidia is the learning loop created when a major deployment runs infrastructure at extreme scale. In our view, large-scale Blackwell deployments — particularly the kind of “push it to the limits” rollout that X.ai is driving — act as a forcing function that exposes bugs, tightens systems performance and accelerates resilience. Nvidia learns from this and then propagates those learnings across its customer base, which translates into a time-to-market advantage that is difficult for alternatives to match unless Nvidia stumbles operationally. In our opinion, this dynamic will compound as scale finds issues faster, fixes get distributed broadly and the platform improves as more customers run it in production-like conditions. Gemini 3, as Baker points out, has demonstrated the scaling laws are still working. Our research indicates that, if scaling continues to pay off, then the market’s center of gravity shifts toward whoever can deliver the most training and inference work per dollar, per watt and per unit time — at scale. That’s where Nvidia’s roadmap is positioned to reassert its dominance as GB300’s are drop-in-compatible with GB200. The delta from Hopper to Blackwell was nontrivial. We’ve previously reported the lower reliability of GB200-based racks due new cooling requirements, rack densities and the overall complexity of the transition. But early reports suggest GB300-based configurations at neoclouds are performing exceptionally well with low friction for upgrades from GB200-based infrastructure. This compatibility accelerates deployment velocity, and improves the probability that customers stay on the Nvidia upgrade path rather than detouring into architectural forks. And the economics favor Nvidia. We believe the economics of the TPU/ASIC stack are often overlooked. A critical constraint is if a large portion of value accrues to a supplier (for example Broadcom as Google’s ASIC partner), then the “low-cost producer” claim becomes more complicated. Gavin Baker estimates at scale, roughly $15 billion of Google’s $30 billion TPU revenue goes to Broadcom, which eats a major share of the margin pool. Baker used a simply analogy that Google is like the architect and Broadcom is the builder – it manages the TSMC relationship. He correctly points out that Apple has taken control of both the front-end design and all the back-end work, including managing TSMC, because at its scale, that level of vertical integration makes sense. This dynamic puts pressure on Google’s behavior over time. Even if TPU unit economics look attractive in isolation, the supplier margin structure can erode the sustained ability to undercut the market — especially as Nvidia’s performance-per-system improves. Baker stated that the OpEx for Broadcom’s entire semi division is $5 billion, so at scale, Google paying Broadcom $15 billion may become less attractive. We believe the roadmap implication is that GB300 will reset the cost curve and Rubin extends it again, the space between Nvidia and TPU/ASIC alternatives increases dramatically. In our opinion, that doesn’t make TPUs irrelevant; it makes them situational. As Nvidia’s platform becomes a lower-cost token producer at scale, alternatives are forced into narrower lanes or into “use what you have” strategies. This topic is reminiscent of a battle in the disk drive business in the 1980s. Seagate was a leading manufacturer of hard drives at the time and pursued a vertically integrated strategy, manufacturing its own heads, media and the drives themselves. In the 1980’s, Quantum was struggling with manufacturing quality but revived its business by outsourcing production to MKE, a world-class Japanese-based manufacturer. Though this required tight engineering coordination between designers and manufacturing, it addressed Quantum’s “back-end” challenges. Quantum began to gain share rapidly and its stock price rose. This author, in a conversation with industry legend Al Shugart, CEO of Seagate, asked if this was a new business model that had merit. Shugart said simply, “When you have to pay someone to make your product, you make less.” He further intimated that long-term, when the industry consolidated, he would be the last man standing. At the time there were around 80 hard drive manufacturers. Today there are three, with Seagate the most valuable. There’s a tight linkage between silicon and models. In this next section we move further up the stack and examine the recent narrative around Google, Gemini and OpenAI. Our research indicates the competitive battle is moving up the stack. Thoough there’s excitement about the rapid improvement in model capability — and we believe larger, more complete models will continue to emerge as AI factories ramp — a key strategic premise of ours is that model quality alone won’t be the enduring differentiator. In our view, the center of gravity shifts to: As laid out above, even if Google can claim periods of cost advantage today, we believe Nvidia’s platform learnings, drop-in upgrade path and performance roadmap — combined with the margin realities embedded in TPU supply chains — shift the “low-cost producer” advantage back toward Nvidia over the next two cycles and likely beyond. We believe it’s fair to say Gemini 3 has had a meaningful impact on the AI conversation, particularly in reinforcing that scaling laws remain intact. But we also believe some of the widely circulated charts — especially those implying ChatGPT is “leveling off” while Gemini is “exploding” — are potentially misleading if they’re used as a proxy for durable competitive advantage or for what matters most economically. Our view is that user growth charts are easy to over-interpret because they compress very different distribution mechanics into a single line. A product can appear to “explode” in monthly active users from bundling, defaults, integration points or placement — while another can appear to “flatten” even as usage quality, monetization and ecosystem affinity remain strong. The data suggests there’s more nuance here than the headline narrative implies. The more important factor, in our opinion, is that Alphabet’s economic center of gravity is still advertising — particularly Search and related advertising properties. As shown below, Google generates an enormous amount of operating profit from advertising, with very large operating margins. Cloud, though meaningful in absolute dollars and improving in profitability, is still minor relative to the scale of Search-driven operating profit. Even at rising operating margin levels, the cloud business is small compared with the hundreds of billions in operating profit and cash generation tied to the advertising machine. And the “Other Bets” category is economically immaterial in the context of the overall profit engine. Google has arguably the world’s best technology marketplace in the form of Search — extraordinary query volume, an unparalleled advertising monetization model and a highly efficient compute foundation that reinforces profitability. The system works, and it works at massive scale. The dilemma, in our view, is how Google migrates from that dominant model to something “more complete” without undermining the profit engine that made it dominant in the first place. The data suggests the challenge is not whether Google can build strong AI models — it clearly can. The challenge is whether it can evolve the product and business model of Search in a way that preserves economics while moving toward a new interaction paradigm. Our strategic questions for Google are: Gemini’s momentum is impressive, but we believe the larger story is economic and structural. Google’s strength in search creates the very dilemma it has to solve to lead the next phase. We believe the earlier monthly active user charts tell an incomplete story that can be misleading if used to infer leadership or monetization power. The more instructive view is engagement as shown above. Specifically, the SimilarWeb data shows user minutes on the web — because time spent is a better proxy for intensity of use, dependency, and ultimately monetizable opportunity. ChatGPT maintains a meaningful lead in user minutes, even as Gemini is growing quickly. The chart also shows fast growth from other entrants (for example DeepSeek and Grok), but in our view the competitive reality remains concentrated and it’s primarily a two-horse race for the bulk of user attention between ChatGPT and Gemini. The key metric is not only “who is growing,” but who is capturing time. We believe the implications become more acute when you overlay Google’s economic model. Google’s profit engine is built on advertising monetization tied to search behavior — high volume, low marginal cost and well-optimized conversion funnels. That machine depends on serving an enormous number of ad opportunities efficiently. But if the interaction model shifts toward ChatGPT-style experiences — richer answers, longer sessions and more compute-heavy responses — the cost structure changes dramatically. Our research indicates each unit of engagement in an assistant-style model is materially more compute-intensive than the classic search model. The point made above is for a comparable “user minute,” the assistant model can consume on the order of ~10 times more compute resources to generate substantially richer output for the end user. In our view, this is the crux of why merging an AI assistant interaction model with an ad-funded business model is not trivial: So although an AI-native interface may create a more compelling product, it also risks turning the economics of ad delivery from a high-margin machine into a heavier-cost model — unless monetization mechanics evolve to compensate. We believe user minutes is a better metric than MAUs, but it still doesn’t fully capture the true shift. Time spent doesn’t directly measure the quantity and richness of knowledge being produced and delivered into the market — and that richness is precisely what drives the compute intensity. The bottom line is engagement is the right metric, but the deeper point is economic. If the market moves from low-cost search interactions to compute-heavy assistant interactions, the cost to serve — and therefore the cost to monetize — rises sharply. That’s the pressure point for Google’s ad-dominated business model in our view. We believe a common refrain — “Google will just disrupt itself” — ignores the single most important constraint in that the economics of search are uniquely favorable to Google, and moving from classic search to an assistant-style interaction model changes the unit economics in a way that can break the profit engine. Our research indicates the cost of a search is a fraction of a cent. That outcome is the product of: In our view, this is arguably the cheapest large-scale compute service in the world, and among the best-operated at global scale. The point is that revenue per search is ~five times to 10 times the gross margin on the cost of the search itself. That’s the heart of the extraordinary business model Google has built – ultra-low unit cost paired with a monetization engine that extracts high value per interaction. In our opinion, you don’t casually disrupt a model with those economics — not because you lack vision, but because the alternative must clear a very high economic bar. Our research indicates the nature of search queries supports these economics: This is a high-volume, low-complexity workload. It is optimized for speed, efficiency and monetization — not for generating richly reasoned outputs. Our central claim is that if Google converts this ultra-cheap interaction into an OpenAI-style experience — richer responses, longer sessions, higher compute per interaction — the cost structure rises sharply. If cost per “search” increases by an order of magnitude while monetization mechanics remain in the old ad model, the economics compress and the business model can break. The bottom line is Google can absolutely innovate, but the data indicates self-disruption is economic surgery. The existing search machine is optimized around simplicity and margin. Shifting to compute-intensive assistant behavior without a new monetization model risks collapsing the very engine that funds the transition. The debate about whether Google can disrupt itself becomes much clearer when you model cost per session rather than looking at top-line user counts. As indicated, the economics of classic Google search are engineered around extremely low cost per interaction and very high-margin monetization. Assistant-style sessions invert that equation. Our research indicates the cost per interaction for Google Search is in the range of roughly 0.2 to 0.5 (as presented on the slide above), and because queries per session are low, the resulting cost per session is still “less than pennies.” The monetization model is also tightly coupled to this structure in that Google monetizes with ads per query, and the combination of low cost + strong ad yield produces very high margins. In our view, this is why Google Search has been such a durable business model. It is a highly optimized, low-cost service that is monetized efficiently at massive scale. ChatGPT’s cost per interaction is much higher, and the session pattern is different with five to 10 queries per session rather than the short, lightweight search interactions. When you multiply those factors, the cost per session becomes dramatically higher — we think ~100 times higher than Google Search. Importantly, the point is not that ChatGPT is inefficient. The claim is that ChatGPT is already among the leaders in efficiency — and yet the underlying interaction paradigm is still much more compute-intensive per session. We believe this is the core reason Google can’t simply flip Search into a ChatGPT-like model without destabilizing margins. Our research indicates the most economically valuable portion of search is product and commercial search — only ~10% to 20% of queries, but responsible for ~60% to 70% of search revenue. In our view, that concentration is exactly what makes the transition so difficult. Specifically: We believe this is one of the most important ideas in the entire research note. The model moves from low-cost ads and blue links thrown at users toward a higher-value, higher-cost information economy where trust and accurate representation are the product. In our view, this has two direct implications: Google’s current approach — offering a hybrid path where users can go deeper into AI mode — is both clever and useful. In an ideal world, Google would prefer to introduce assistant-style experiences slowly, ring-fence them as a separate business, and price them at a premium. But the point is that reality constrains the strategy because Google has to protect the commercial-search numbers. And though Google would like to layer higher-value services on top and charge advertisers materially more, it may be easier for challengers to enter with higher-cost, higher-trust services without needing to defend a legacy margin structure. This, we believe, is OpenAI’s advantage. That tension makes the hybrid model look less like a stable end state and more like a transitional strategy — a fence-sitter that ultimately has to resolve toward one economic model or the other. In our view, the market is carving into two distinct conflicts: The bottom line is cost per session is the economic forcing function in this new game. It explains why self-disruption is difficult, why the high-value commercial slice is vulnerable and why the market may shift from cheap ad inventory toward higher-cost, trust-based representation. This is the battle line for the next decade. We believe the core issue in “the future of search” is not model quality. The issue is a revenue model mismatch. Traditional search is an ad-funded machine optimized to deliver low-cost discovery — effectively “10 blue links” thrown at the user — where monetization is tied to placement and clicks, not to the intrinsic quality and trustworthiness of the information delivered. As search becomes answer-centric and trust-centric, our research indicates a large portion of Google’s profit pool becomes exposed. In this research we try to make a concentrated revenue point that we believe is the linchpin: In our view, this is the part of the business that is most vulnerable to trust erosion. If users begin to believe the answer is optimized for the advertiser rather than for the buyer, the value proposition degrades quickly — and that small slice is exactly where buyers are most sensitive to quality, ranking integrity and confidence. The risk is that Google can retain the bulk of total search volume and still lose the economically decisive segment: “90% of search,” but not the part that pays the bills. Our research indicates generating an answer with generative AI is at least an order of magnitude more expensive than a classic, highly optimized search query — and potentially two or three orders depending on the experience design. At Google’s scale, even modest mix shifts toward AI-heavy sessions can have outsized margin impact. We believe this becomes both a timing and a strategy issue. In other words, the transition begins to bite into margins as usage patterns migrate, and the company has to manage a delicate balance between to countervailing forces: From the consumer standpoint, there is an upside in that users can increasingly choose between low-cost traditional search and higher-quality, higher-trust answer engines. But that optionality increases competitive pressure. Because Google’s search share is so highly elevated, it has nowhere to go but down from here, because the competitive axis is shifting. In classic search, if the result isn’t good, the user simply refines the query and continues. In assistant-driven search, as users build affinity for an engine that consistently returns higher-quality outcomes, has memory and trust becomes the moat. The platform that earns that trust can pull disproportionate share of the highest-value sessions. The key point is even if Google’s model quality is strong, the business model incentives are different. In our view, the future state is not “smarter ads.” It’s a different value chain where brands need to be represented accurately, compared appropriately, and surfaced based on fit — not on who bought the top slot. The premise of this research captures the delta – a complex, high-intent request can be satisfied in a single minute with ranked options and an action plan, versus a longer, more iterative search process. Our research indicates that this “high-quality commercial search” experience is precisely where share can migrate — and it’s the most economically meaningful slice that moves. We believe OpenAI has a structural incentive advantage rooted in its revenue model: That incentive system is fundamentally different from ad-funded search where the buyer is not the user, and where brands pay for placement. In our opinion, this creates a more direct “quality to revenue” linkage for the assistant platform. On the brand side, our research indicates the emerging play is buyer-facing APIs backed by trusted information, designed to score well in answer engines. That is a different marketing and distribution model than classic search engine optimization and paid links. We believe the right way to frame it is SEO is not dead, but it will matter less over time. As answer engines mediate discovery and ranking through trust and structured vendor information, the importance of classic SEO mechanics declines. Our view is that the market bifurcates in a way that can still look “good” in absolute terms for Google while being strategically disruptive: Google will fight hard for that high-value slice, but our research indicates it requires substantial work above the model layer: APIs, software capabilities, interface design and the surrounding service stack that enables vendors and users to extract real utility from the platform. Bottom line is the future of search is a restructuring of incentives and economics. The platform that aligns trust, representation quality and monetization has the advantage in the most valuable part of the market. We believe it’s useful to end this segment in the context of an earlier Breaking Analysis where we put forth a plausible scenario where Google could have disrupted OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. That scenario was not irrational — it was rooted in Google’s deep technical bench, its distribution and the assumption that it could translate model strength into product and platform leadership. But the picture on the slide above — “OpenAI likely to retain its leadership” — reflects what our research indicates today – the conditions that sustain OpenAI’s lead are strengthening, not weakening. Our view is that the market is over-fixated on model-to-model comparisons. The reality is that the leading labs will all produce very high-quality LLMs. Google’s models are strong. Anthropic’s Claude has positioned around coding. Gemini has demonstrated competence in many tasks and Grok is moving fast. The point is not that any one of these is “bad.” We believe the durable differentiation is shifting away from raw model quality and toward: Our research indicates OpenAI maintains leadership in several areas: We also believe OpenAI’s close relationship with Nvidia matters. Our contention is if Nvidia remains the critical supplier for frontier compute, and if OpenAI is tightly coupled to that ecosystem, then OpenAI is positioned to receive preferential allocation versus competitors — particularly versus those whose narrative depends on Nvidia being displaced. In our view, that allocation dynamic reinforces time-to-capability and time-to-market. The most important datapoint in this segment, in our opinion, is the mix shift described between consumer usage and enterprise adoption. We note movement from roughly 70/30 (users/enterprise) last year to about 60/40 by the end of this year. We believe this is a meaningful signal because enterprise growth tends to be stickier and more platform-defining than consumer novelty. Our research indicates enterprise adoption will increase as organizations learn how to: In our view, that enterprise “data readiness” journey is what turns an AI model into an enterprise system — and that is where platform advantage compounds. We believe Google has advantages and will remain a formidable competitor. But our premise is that OpenAI is more likely to emerge as a high-quality software and platform player in enterprise AI than Google, which — despite being strong technically — is not broadly perceived as the enterprise AI software leader. Our view is that this matters because the next phase of competition is not “who has the best model demo,” but “who owns the workflow and the integration fabric.” Our research indicates OpenAI is “a country mile ahead” at the moment in platform momentum. That does not mean the lead is unassailable. OpenAI could blow up, or competitors could find superior approaches. But as of now, we believe the most likely outcome is continued leadership because the factors that matter most — platform, developer adoption, enterprise mix shift and access to scarce compute — are currently aligned in OpenAI’s favor. The two big conclusions of this Breaking Analysis are: The bottom line is the early “Google disrupts OpenAI” scenario was plausible. But the data and the platform dynamics suggest OpenAI’s first-mover advantage is evolving into something more durable — especially as the enterprise becomes the center of gravity. OpenAI’s relationship with Nvidia is meaningful.

Title: Wearables report card 2025: How smartwatches, rings, and glasses fared this year against my predictions

Smart glasses grew beyond analysts' predictions, Oura crushed rivals with patents, and Garmin charged a premium for new models. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been a dramatic 2025 for wearables. Some trends were predictable, like smart glasses continuing their exponential growth and smartwatches adding more AI and health features. But I didn't anticipate some things, like Oura lawsuits strangling its smart ring rivals or the impact of tariffs. I've decided to look back on my 2025 forecast for smart rings, glasses, and watches, including two analysts' predictions, and judge how well our collective expectations lined up with reality. Then, I'll look at the biggest wearable and fitness watch brands and grade their 2025 performance — where they succeeded and how they could have done better. As expected, Garmin tested "loyal users' willingness to buy pricier status-symbol smartwatches." The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($1.2–2K) and Venu X1 ($800) are clear examples, but even mid-rangers like the Venu 4 ($550) have become more high-end. Add in the $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3, $500 and $650 Galaxy Watches, and the $1,000 Polar Grit X2 Pro, and you can see brands normalizing phone-level prices (and offsetting tariff costs). It was also expected that there would be "more options" for thrifty consumers. The Apple Watch SE 3 qualifies, sticking to its old $250 price, but it's the exception. We saw cheap trackers from Xiaomi and CMF, but very few cheap Android smartwatches besides discounted last-gen models. Even Amazfit sold as many $300+ watches as $100 ones. Tariffs have interfered with budget options, making it more profitable to attract wealthier hobbyists. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Meanwhile, Google, Samsung, and Apple started pushing the idea of smartwatch AI in 2025. But it's still mostly on-phone processing of queries and health data analysis. The Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch S11 have on-watch AI tools like smart replies or live translation, and I appreciate how Gemini on Android watches syncs well with Google apps. I expect a bigger AI push in 2026, particularly with the Fitbit Personal Health Coach AI. Again, companies clearly want smartwatches to become medical devices, but we're still in the predictive "wellness" phase. For example, Samsung added virtual doctor's visits and prescription management while giving its watches vascular health and antioxidant index analysis, with heart failure warnings coming soon. That said, my analyst's prediction of direct blood pressure monitoring on watches in 2025 didn't happen. But Apple started offering hypertension alerts, while Fitbit and Oura launched hypertension studies — so at least we're getting warning signs for high blood pressure. As for smart rings, I don't have hard figures for 2025 yet, but IDC's current estimates show it's a tiny but growing sliver compared to fitness trackers, and growing much more slowly than smart glasses. Sales have grown, but I'm expecting the category to stagnate. Oura has leveraged its patents to demand royalty payments from every major smart ring brand, bringing Circular and RingConn to heel, successfully banning Ultrahuman from the U.S., and currently challenging Samsung. The current rumor is that Samsung won't make a Galaxy Ring 2, and there's little hope for competition and innovation in the space if brands like Fitbit and Apple decide it's not worth the legal hassle — or giving Oura a cut of the profits — to make a smart ring. Finally, IDC's Jitesh Ubrani wasn't bullish on smart glasses' future last year, saying that "most consumers don't need" the photo/ video/ music/ AI combo and that sales would only climb from 2.5 million to 3.5 million in 2025. Turns out, IDC's current forecast is 9.4 million glasses sold in 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban/Oakley partner EssilorLuxottica has ramped up production to 10 million per year, and Ubrani is much more enthusiastic about smart glasses' future. That said, 10 million sold may not qualify as "mainstream," compared to 200 million smartwatches and trackers in 2025. The Samsung AI and HUD glasses coming in 2026 should help the category continue to grow, especially internationally. Garmin launched a series of successful, high-quality watches this year: the Instinct 3 for hikers and campers, the Vivoactive 6 for thrifty indoor athletes and daily step-counters, the Forerunner 570 for runners and triathletes, the Forerunner 970 for pro-level athletes and trail runners, and the Venu 4 as the all-around best option. Unfortunately, Garmin raised watch prices across its entire lineup for extra revenue, delivering strong earnings but making them less accessible to everyday athletes. As much as I love the Venu X1, I can't recommend people spend $800 on one. From an economic standpoint, Garmin has become a top-5 brand for worldwide smartwatch sales. Despite that, Garmin's stock plummeted because its uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro couldn't compete with last year's massive Fenix 8 sales, undoing all its gains. The new Garmin Connect+ subscription, which launched this year, may have earned some profits, but Garmin fans have never embraced the feature, especially when it's required for features like Garmin Trails, extra badges, and their Year in Review summary. Unrealistic shareholder expectations aside, Garmin has had a strong year, but its tendency to price-lock the best features to Fenix-level watches is harder to stomach when the "cheaper" models are still expensive. And you never know when there'll be a major blue triangle crash. I won't grade every fitness watch brand, but I'm highlighting COROS because it's had a strong 2025 as a foil to Garmin. The COROS Nomad, Apex 4, and Pace 4 have each impressed me with their accurate GPS and HR data, weeks of battery life, affordable prices, and fast performance for trail and street maps. COROS gained some ground on its rivals with vital features: media playback controls, move alerts, undo laps, flashlight mode, cycle tracking, mid-activity voice alerts, street names and POIs on maps, and an adventure journal. Equally important, COROS updates its entire lineup, rather than price-lock features to the flagships. It makes models like the $300 COROS Pace Pro feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have. It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's 2025 end-of-year report. It won't catch up to Garmin (2nd overall) anytime soon, but COROS has earned a reputation for budget quality with serious athletes — stealing Garmin's customers. COROS's main 2025 blemish was an IT exposé revealing major security vulnerabilities on all COROS watches, letting hackers potentially access your account, snoop on notifications, and worse. COROS says it has resolved these issues, thankfully. Oura reports selling 5.5 million rings so far, with half those sales in the past 12 months. It also has a new U.S. DoD contract, which requires them to build a manufacturing facility in Texas. This deal also caused some backlash over fears Oura would share private data with the Trump administration, but CEO Tom Hale has reassured otherwise. The Oura Ring 4 continuously received new features in 2025. The LLM-powered Oura Advisor is the centerpiece, giving advice and coaching based on your ring stats. The AI Meals tool gives you a nutritional summary of your plate with a photo. Your Oura Ring can now track pregnancy and premenopause symptoms. Its Preventive Health data studies signs of cumulative stress. The list goes on! Oura also launched the Ring 4 Ceramic, a more expensive model with premium zirconia ceramic materials. While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4. Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest. That's a good business position to be in. Meta released three pairs of smart glasses in 2025, which is a significant accomplishment. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the centerpiece, and while it isn't significantly different from the original, the extra hours of battery and 3K video do make it easier to recommend. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cater specifically to the athletic crowd, particularly with the Garmin integration, and while I loved them, it'll take time to see whether they resonate because of the weight and price. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses have struck a chord with the tech niche, with some impressive HUD features that have started to live up to the Google Glass idea people have waited a decade for. They're too thick, heavy, and expensive to break out of that niche, but it's a step in the right direction. Hardware aside, Meta has done well with software updates in 2025. It added Meta AI support for several apps (Audible, Spotify, Google Calendar, Outlook, and Weather), released Live AI and Live Translation, sped up camera captures, and brought Gen 2 features like improved stabilization to the Gen 1 glasses.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/21/the-magnificent-seven-myth-is-starting-to-crack/
Time Published: 2025-12-21T15:23:52Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down. Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting. Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening. I said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast. Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis. That strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise. Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world. [00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you’ll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year? [00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are. [00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn’t surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. ’cause they’ve had a solid year. No, just those two. [00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly. [00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it’s no surprise that they’re having a hard time at this juncture because most of ’em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it’s interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we’ve been around long enough to see, and I wasn’t really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there’s always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there’s only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are. [00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it’s only at like once in a generation. It’s not like once every a hundred years. [00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down? [00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you’ve just described, you’ve got five of seven running outta gas, you’re really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top. [00:02:54] That’s when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah. [00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that’s, that, that’s interesting about that is now it’s not like the S&P hasn’t had a decent year. It’s up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we’re headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row. [00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we’ve had since I, I don’t know. I, guess you’d have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven’t seen anything like this since the mid nineties. [00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let’s go back to something we said earlier, and it’s important if you own the S&P 500, if you’ve got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we’re talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn’t just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don’t just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever. [00:04:06] It’s great. If you’ve made a lot of money on, being, there’s several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I’d sell some of that absolutely. [00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we’ve had these last three years. That’s what I mean. That’s always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason. [00:04:32] They thought, oh, it’s gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that’s why I always had, look, let’s sell half. Let’s sell a third. Let’s at least put some in the bank. Because they don’t build those casinos ’cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it. [00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it’s taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn’t run as much, or whatever the case might be. [00:05:16] But I think you’re exactly right.

Pietro Laureano describes it beautifully in The Water Atlas. It’s one of the finest books I’ve ever seen. Here’s a pdf (big): https://catalogue.unccd.int/1148_The-water-atlas.pdf Thank you! “Finnish finance minister calls EU’s loan deal for Ukraine ‘major failure'” Gee, she is pretty sour about the EU only giving Zelensky €90 billion instead of those frozen/stolen Russian assets. I got an idea. Maybe Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra could tell the EU that Finland will step up to the plate and give Zelensky €120 billion from their coffers to make up the €210 billion that he was expecting. Hope that President Alexander Stubb is not reading this as he would regard that as a great idea. I feel like there are some matters of the conflict with respect to engineering or logistics I can speak to and understand. But the continued push to throw more and more money into the corrupt pit that is Ukraine baffles me. I can’t even ask NC’s favorite question, “cui bono?” I have no idea who could possibly benefit from this death and destruction. Especially since we have now proven our NATO weapons platforms don’t work and showing more people how badly they don’t work as the conflict continues can’t be good for business. Also, it appears from polling results that EUcrats aligned with the Ukraine project continue to do poorly and are now facing a resurgent right wing in their countries. So why is everyone in Europe so damn committed to death by 10000 cuts here? There is no plan for winning in the sense that the West have defined victory. Russia has been very clear that they’re not going to freeze the conflict or grant a ceasefire so Ukraine can lick its wounds and rre-arm. So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Are there any analysts who seem to have a clue? Thomas Fazi, on his Substack, makes an interesting argument: “ I intend to argue that the current NATO-Russia confrontation is simply the latest chapter in a century-long Western campaign to weaken, isolate and contain Russia. This antagonism long predates the Soviet Union and is rooted in both geopolitical and civilisational motives: Western powers have historically viewed Russia as too large, too independent and too culturally distinct to integrate into a Western-led order” https://www.thomasfazi.com/p/the-wests-century-long-war-against (Sorry if this has already been a link) With politicians who have the memory of a fish, explanations like this leave me uncomfortable. IMO this doesn’t make any sense and doesn’t help in any way or form to explain why the idiots in charge are playing the fool so much. We might try to find reasons back to the Middle Ages but let’s be clear, these are not “reasons” neither “roots” of conflict. Politicians have the minds of goldfish. The Rich like it that way. Ancient cultural imperatives and Prime Directives remove the need for “having a mind” and any goldfish can keep re-doing more of the same of what has been pre-done for the last thousand years. And with the “brain-parasites” from Eastern Europe and ” Legacy Great-Game Britain” now in firm command of NATO’s cultural brain-command centers, don’t be surprised if this is sustained until it can’t be, per Herbert Stein’s dictum that “anything that can’t continue will stop”. This will continue until it can’t, then it will stop. >>>So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Have you ever seen deer trapped in a car’s headlights? I think that see the oncoming wreck, but have no idea what to do except more of the same. I wonder if the continuing the war serves the cause of consolidating the EU into a kind of US of Europe. Indebting the member nations by funding Ukraine and having member states indebt themselves by expanding their militaries will increasingly put the EU under the tutelege of creditors. Creditors might prefer dealing with one central agency in Brussels rather than dozens of national capitals. Immigration/Police state Please see: https://jennbudd.substack.com/p/the-real-purpose-of-ice-raids This may be the reason that all of the border relief workers that I work with speak of seeing less BP and way more active military along the wall. People doing water drops are now regularly approached by bored military personnel wondering what’s going on. I have heard that BP agents who “go on safari” get significant bonus and Per Diem money. And since it is really boring patrolling out here, going off to tackle some guys in a Home Depot parking lot may look like fun While President Trump and the people he works with probably believe that they can suppress voters using the same methods as the Southern elites did after they overthrew Reconstruction, using goon squads (and let’s be serious here, death squads as both the police and the KKK were by the elites and not only in the South) would likely go very badly for them. If nothing else, I am not sure that the local police and the national guard would acquiesce, nor would the locals themselves. The Border Patrol would probably win in the first election, but once people got over their suprise, and after the ruling party lost its Mandate of Heaven, the loss of acceptance, and therefore authority and power would be extreme. The United States is still a quasi democracy and the government depends on the people’s acceptance of at least semi fair elections; it has been this way since almost two centuries before there was an United States. It is more of a cultural reflex or instinct than conscious thought. Historically authoritarianism has been expensive. Policing, containment and punishment compete for resources while simultaneously reducing manpower. Brutality, torture, terror and horror are then made political tools, pour encourager les autres. With this, and the redirection to MAGA aims of the vast American siloviki between Georgetown and Langley, team Trump hope to keep those domestic costs manageable. That said, the incompetence of it all in the face of our traditional myths of freedom, culture of satirical humor, and the basic decency amongst most of us commoners makes me believe you’re right and eventually we’ll vote again for something better! Correction. “Hope we will be offered the chance to vote for something better…..” Preventing that has been the plan so far…… Which has worked so far, but denying even the option of voting for the approved candidates is still likely to backfire. I don’t know. Denying the people the option of voting for “the other side” did sort of backfire on the Dems, but it didn’t exactly lead to any improvement, other than tearing down further what was already a dubious situation. That post is likely correct that the idea is to use ICE and border patrol to suppress black and latino votes. Given how its going and the stakes involved, I would guess in particular in the 2026 midterms. There are a number of other clues to such an agenda: Trump’s expressed wish to federalise the elections, Trump’s propaganda against postal voting, ICE and border patrol pushing the line by raids in court houses, Trump’s continued insistence that 2020 was stolen, the open gerrymandering. I think what might stop them is the polling. If it looks like they will still lose they might think twice. Or double down, depending on how desperate they are at that point. “India will surpass Germany to become third-largest economy by 2027: Scindia” I don’t mean to rain on India’s parade but it should be remembered that German is being rapidly deindustrialized as well as taking on colossal amounts of debt so it may not be so much a case of India rising here as Germany sinking. Here are the guys at The Duran talking about Merz and the German economy- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWCUgu_hzM4 (20:41 mins) I think part of the German decline is because they are paying dearly to India as a middle-man for Russian energy. The final phase of the decolonization of Europe – the idea being that a colonial system consist of the colonized and the colonizers, not really dipping into the idea that EU has been a colony of/exploited by US (that’s another discussion). Germany’s pains are largely self-inflicted. Their abrupt energy policy change some years ago resulted in loss of base load generating capacity. Most utility planners would call that stupid, inviting outages and soaring prices as alternatives were desperately sought. There are more orderly ways to transition over decent realistic intervals that don’t require such risks. Add in their so-called political class and that spelled trouble. Is acquiescing to Biden’s elimination of Nordstream the policy shift to which you refer? They had some problems before no doubt due to the same Greens who led them into war with Ukraine(once removed) shuttering base load, but industry didn’t actively start migrating until the Biden move forced it. Did the Germans blow Nordstream? The decision not to invest in new nuclear power (or renovation to practically the same extent as new), but instead go for wind and solar did not cause outages and soaring prices. We know this because there was enough time between that shift and the 2022 war to see the difference. In fact the minimal cost of marginal electricity production from wind and solar pushed prices down. What increased electricity prices in 2022 was the lack of cheap gas and half the French reactors being idle for half a year. (So much for stable base load). And the main problem for German industry isn’t even electricity prices, it’s gas as a direct input in industrial processes. >>>>Americans have lied about a Venmo glitch to avoid paying the bill. Not saying that is neccessarily wrong….but all these “polling” stories, irrespective of “conclusion”, need to be taken with an **extreme** grain of salt unless conducted by a reputable pollster. There is a cottage industy of lazy market research and polling—-relying on paid, online respondents. (garbage in, garbage out) naturally since it’s paid, the respondent pool skews to self-identifying as wealthy—as few paid polls involving research the non-comfortable. see amy survey, especially touted by a non-authoritative or tabloid outlet (NY Post)….be skeptical! My bank doesn’t allow Venmo transfers, for what it’s not worth. The article says it’s this one from Harris https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Income-Paradox-Survey-November-2025.pdf. It doesn’t mention paying respondents. I thought it was an interesting read but otoh not really a surprise. I don’t think it would be hard to use up a 6-figure income on mortgage, kids, day care, cars, insurance, utilities, food and the rest. Also see Part 1: My Life Is a Lie by Michael Green, and IIRC has been previously linked at NC, in which he argues that the true poverty line for a family of four should be $140K per year for a family of four. Tangentially related, I was just listening to a New Yorker Radio Hour interview with Maine Senate candidate, Graham Platner, in which he claims he and his wife are getting by on $60K per year, which he says is only made possible by his having free healthcare from the VA. I haven’t listened to the interview. Maybe he’s giving a lot of his annual salary to his campaign, but U.S. Senators are paid $174,000 a year. “James Webb Space Telescope confirms 1st ‘runaway’ supermassive black hole rocketing through home galaxy at 2.2 million mph: ‘It boggles the mind!” Imagine a planet with an emerging sapient species. They go from discovering agricultural to being an industrial society in only 4,000 year. Eventually they put more and more resources into astronomy because one part of the sky looks weird. And eventually they work out that it is because a supermassive black hole is heading directly for them and there is not a damn thing to be done. What sort of effect would that have on an intelligent species? And for all we know, this could be happening right now. there was a story arc in Stargate Universe about just that…nd im too scatterbrained, atm…but i do recall a couple of Star Trek episodes and at least one Arthur C Clarke story regarding this scenario. lol, prob. thinking of the Star Trek Voy episode where the Voyager is an anomaly in a time-accelerated planet….and Voyager causes a scientific explosion on said planet. (The Doctor also fathers a kid, random unexplored plot point) That episode is based on a short story….and in classic literary style, there is a debate of the Voyager story is an homage, or an outright rip-of And that is all I can remember without resorting to the internet. and IIRC, this type of plot point is almost commo enough to be labeled a sci-fi trope? Know the episode that you mean as it was one of their finest in story telling. It was called “Blink of an Eye”- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_of_an_Eye_(Star_Trek:_Voyager) I liked how in each era they were at the same place that starts off a hill with a shrine to the gods until it is eventually overlooking an advanced city. You guys might enjoy the following Netflix video which is kinda along the same lines- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGEUv6CCPM (3:46 mins) It really does boggle the mind. I got stuck with acute boggling twice just in the first sentence. First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun. That’s about 10^5 astronomucal units (AU), i.e. 100,000 times the distance of the Earth from the sun. For comparison, the orbit of Neptune is about 60 AU. This black hole is about the size of the Oort cloud is theorized to be. Second, “rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour”. What does that mean? In first year physics at Edinburgh we got an introduction to Special Relativity class and since then I have never been comfortable with the notion of astronomical speed or velocity. I can deal with quantifying the relative movent of two things but I don’t understand the speed of one thing in space. Is space itself a thing we can measure the speed of something else against? And that speed they said, 1000 km/s. For comparison, the speed of light is only 300 times that. But yeah, whatever that means, if you think human violence is bad, or even measured against what some imagine god might do to punish us, the scale and power of this speedy SMBH boggles. “First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun.” OTOH, they could mean that the *mass* of that black hole is 10 million times the mass of our sun. Which I think is more likely, but I haven’t read the article. I considered that but then I think they should have used a word other than “larger”. However, assuming you’re right, the Schwarzschild radius for 10 million solar masses, according to Wolfram Alpha, is 295.3 10^8, only 42 times larger than the sun, or about 0.1974 AU, which fits inside the orbit of Mercury. *only* “its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun” The mass of this black hole is about 10 million times the sun not 10 million times larger. https://astronomyexplained.com/how-big-are-black-holes/#google_vignette “The supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 (M87) gained significant attention in 2019. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope took the first image of its shadow. With a mass estimated to be 6.5 billion times that of the Sun, this supermassive black hole has a size comparable to the solar system.” So comparing physical size of the sun to a black hole has to take in the difference in density. Think of a lead ball compared to a styrofoam ball. Well, now I’m boggling again. 6.5 billion solar masses gives M87’s SMBH a 128.3 AU event horizon radius. I’m no physicist but am puzzled by the assertion in the story that this thing is generating a shock-wave ahead of itself, given that a) its supergravity would surely attract anything towards it as soon as any influence is felt and, b) it’s travelling in a vacuum so what would transmit any shockwave forward? Somewhere in the Universe it probably is. Aren’t we in that same thought experiment with our own heat death? Cassandras and skeptics. Venezuela tanker: “But the vessel boarded on Saturday, called the Centuries, is not on a list of entities under U.S. sanctions that is publicly maintained by the Treasury Department. The people inside Venezuela’s oil industry said the cargo belongs to an established China-based oil trader with a history of taking Venezuelan crude oil to Chinese refineries.” https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/20/us/politics/us-coast-guard-venezuela-oil-tanker.html Pirating Chinese oil seems like something that could have some sort of international fallout but who knows anymore. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. You should read the Homeland Security tweet- ‘Homeland Security @DHSgov PREPARE TO BE BOARDED. This morning @USCG in coordination with the @DeptofWar executed a lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries, which is suspected of carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions. The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.’ https://xcancel.com/DHSgov/status/2002493812976095249 Arrgghhhh, me maties. Good thing that they did not drag China into all this as they won’t sit down and take it. Oh wait… It’s all so very Ragnar Danneskjöld, this piracy on the high seize… Does everything have to follow the plot in Atlas Shrugged? Reads like some teen bragging about his videogame wins. Surprised they didn’t spell it “Rulz the waves”. Also, I’m no history expert but wasn’t “iron fist” what Stalinist Russia was labelled? Wow our military is bragging about taking over a non-military vessel You guys look like idiots Actually the Coast Guard, which I have a hard time equating with “the military,” although I guess they really are. I don’t recall ever seeing a report that they brutalized the crews of the vessels they seize. Say China (or Russia), sinks a third of the u.s. navy in one fell swoop. I’m wondering if Americans would “rally around the flag” or condemn the current administration for negligence. In that event, to hide our shame and embarrassment at having been defeated by the commie Chinese horde of lesser humans, we’d resort to our own “Samson option”. Because if no one is around to write about a defeat, then it didn’t happen. That’s really dark. Dark but accurate. This is why even after all this the opponents to empire continue to hang separately. Samsonite Option or American Tourister Option? I’d expect Russia and China to arrange a “freedom of navigation” exercise in Caribbean Sea in the very near future. And I doubt it will escalate beyond that. Maybe a joint Russia-China task force sailing between Cuba and Florida then? Can you imagine the panic? We lost our minds over a balloon. https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3288543/f-22-safely-shoots-down-chinese-spy-balloon-off-south-carolina-coast/ Heh heh, yes we did. Very interesting hypothetical that gives you an idea of how much fun it is to be Putin or Xi these days. It has seemed to me that Putin and Lavrov have been trying to conduct an intervention for power and violence addicts since Munich ’07, but now it’s more like cornering a rabid dog. That answers Joe Biden’s question from SOTU that year… “The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.” The messages continue to shock and scare me despite preceding insanity. I won’t make the obvious points, ie. 1. What Federal Law was this tanker in breach of? 2. Federal Jurisdiction is limited to territorial waters only. After all, the US has joyfully regressed to its Wild West childhood where the man with the biggest gun wins, as long as it’s John Wayne. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. Well, not necessarily immediate consequences, but if we entertain the Mahanian idea of the USA being a Sea Power (as in dependent of secure sea lines), deteriorating the the trade security in the proximity of the North American continent may have certain long term repercussions. If naval conflicts replace the “Pax Americana” in places the Multipolar Stability (between agreement capable nations) can’t reach, US may learn about autarky at an accelerated pace. There never seem to be any immediate consequences for US actions internationally. Fixed it for ya! I would say BRICS and the rise of a multipolar world is a consequence of America’s actions. A world responding to decades of senseless wars. The more immediate problem is the neocons are very likely to get the war they so desperately desire despite the fact that the neocon wars America has conducted over the last couple of decades have done a huge number on the US military. Sometimes I cannot help but feel that the whole neocon bit for the last forty years has been a plot to wreck America, mostly because it seems to have worked. High-net-worth investors are pulling out of the stock market.

Bubba is front and center, and doesn’t have the benefit of Epstein’s own attorney and many witnesses attesting to lack of scandalous involvement for Trump. Bubba likely will be joined by a lot of celebrities in the hot seat. Also count on many from both sides of the aisle and from academia and media. The full scope of the espionage and blackmail may never be known, but more spotlights on DC, Cambridge and elsewhere are welcome. Now, pray for the children victimized as their experiences will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Bubba is front and center because Trump was redacted and he wasn’t that of a big deal, politically and power wise speaking… Me thinks Rev Kev was being sarcastic ;-) Could be wrong, though. Perhaps AI can “fill in” the redacted text? Might make for some interesting denials from team Trump. Re the Iran/water story–talk about burying the lead. This is the final para. Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community. Given the heavy Israeli thumb on all of Iran’s international relations clearly the implied path for sanctions removal would be to bring back the reign of the Shahs who, as the article admits, also had more than a little to do with aquifer pumping and other environmental mistakes. One might also point out that the Cadillac Desert problem is prominent in our own Southwest with politically powerful agricultural incumbents being a factor. …rejoin the global trading community. Does the writer know that Iran joined BRICS+ two years ago? It’s 36% of the global community by GDP PPP and 46% by population. 3 of the world top food producing countries are members, too. So maybe, just maybe, Iran is a enough of a member of the global trading community? All in all, I think it was a decent article, especially on the technical points. Like almost everything on Iran in Western or Gulf Arab media though, there’s a strand of concern-trolling running through the whole thing that omits a lot. Besides the sanctions issue you mention: 1. The author brings up that the qanats are centuries old (some millennia), but implies they’ve been mostly damaged / neglected recently. My understanding is most of the old qanat network was degraded irreversibly during the Mongol invasions, partly out of direct destruction, partly out of lack of maintenance. Even after the Mongols, Iran’s population was less urbanized and so much smaller (it didn’t recover fully until the 1950s) that rebuilding a new network was never really feasible. 2. So new qanats today often have to be built from scratch, and what he doesn’t mention, is that you can’t really build them anywhere. You need just the right topography and springs in the right place relative to a population center. Like he does mention, they can also only provide a certain level of flow. With a large population under siege, the hard choice is to pull more water now with pumped wells, try to limit consumption downstream, and hopefully do things more sustainably once they’ve reached a strategic / economic stage closer to China or Russia (probably 1 more generation out). 3. I’m not a hydrologist, but IIUC many of the dams he mentions running almost empty were designed with that in mind. The Iranian government trains a lot of hydrologists, it does pay attention to climate models, and in particular, I think it expects a lot more extreme precipitation events around a drier average. The dams are staggered up in the highlands to retain water from wet / snowy years, not with any expectation of being close to full on average. 4. It still seems like way too many people haven’t realized that the Iranian government wants as many people to (gradually) abandon Tehran as possible. They aren’t going to plow their budget into saving a city they’ve already written off. Everyone assumes it’s going to be whacked with a giant earthquake eventually, plus it’s built right up against the Alborz so the air quality will never be great (imagine Boise during an inversion if 10 million people tried living there). And that’s before you get into all the weird cultural aspects of how the city relates to the rest of the country. File under Bondi Beach and narrative control.

More musk https://futurism.com/future-society/elon-starship-most-important There are no words for what a complete idiot he is A complete idiot? He is the richest person on earth. He must really know what he is doing (and saying). That he got his wealth by hook and crook, and whether he believes in his own drivel is irrelevant; the governments that subsidize his endeavours, the public buying shares in them, the consumers acquiring the junk his firms produce, the press and other pundits transported into states of ectasy at his pronouncements — these are the true imbeciles. Agreed. If he’s an idiot (and he seemingly is) what does that say about everyone else? Same could be said about Trump. He’s clearly a dullard but apparently a slick salesman can climb their way to the top. We are truly a society of marks. I often think back to the NFT/Metaverse craze a few years ago. Was at SXSW in 2022 and it was like being at a massive cult rally as the KoolAid was being passed around. The bottom was already dropping out but everyone was spewing buzzwords, minting coins, and speaking abstractly about the new frontier they were pioneering. I thought, just maybe, in all the talks about presentations I’d garner a hint at some sort of tangible application for any of it but walked away from that experience certain of nothing but how empty it all was. Just hype and faith. But, one thing that seems to draw in legions of diehard acolytes is confident hype. People swoon to that like moths to a flame. I’ll never understand it. Anyone that speaks to me with unbridled confidence repels me like a used car salesman. But it works on the vast majority of humanity it seems. I don’t claim to be smarter than others, I just don’t like salesmen/preacher types. I prefer people who see the complexity of the world and doubt their own grasp of it. Yes, that is why this guy says this is and is not an AI bubble at the same time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3d43DlBOU OpenAI and Xai are cults. I’ve dodged a metaphorical bullet by missing out on big tech jobs a decade or more ago. Watched friends and colleagues go to them. Facebook, Atlassian, slack, google. you don’t get hired, last or thrive in places like that if you question the orthodoxy or show signs of skepticism. they all know what game they’re playing – “big number get bigger”. might as well look for another job if you question it. the sad thing is they don’t always start that way. plenty of moral, ambitious, startups with talented curious skeptical people in them. but those start ups get absorbed by the tech-finance borg and… I think the country has always been like that, but there was a transition in corporate CEOs from engineering background to sales background to finance background. Where once competition was for things like market share, now it’s stock price, a measure far more removed from reality than whether the public likes the design, price and reliability of your cars. And if it’s even worse now, I wonder if it’s not an effect of the existential fear that I believe is creeping in on “little cat feet” throughout Western society. I hear people from my Millennial son to my Boomer friends talk about cutting themselves off from the news in order to avoid the anxiety and dread that seem to be building in the old “West” because of a combination social dissolution, economic instability, international chaos and an increasingly enraged Earth. Do we believe at some level that the confidence man must know something because somebody, somewhere must know something. Otherwise, it’s pretty hard to escape the conclusion that we’re screwed. Another thing I’ve observed about some “normie” types is that they’re desperate for some authority they can rely on. Some resort to traditional religion, the more conservative the better. Some bow the knee to Science as KLG discussed here. Technology and the Progress Myth may even be displacing Science as the sand upon which our society is built, so in such times as these, the Tech huckster has plenty of desperate marks. Yes an idiot. Being born wealthy and then being at the right time, right place takes no intelligence. And the real reason for his wealth, achieving TechBro cult status, he fell into. None of that was planned, and he just believes his own BS. I would add that from my brief time running with some rich and powerful (albeit on a much much lower rung of the ladder), they know so little about tech, and are even intimidated by it, so are incredibly easy to baffle and impress with bull$h1t when it comes to the areas Musk is in. It’s always felt like a lot of his success has been due to sounding intelligent to those who don’t know any better and them having FOMO if he turns out to be right. Astrophysicist and author, Adam Becker, in his book More Everything Forever, provides incisive, science based proofs as to the idiocy of Musk’s Martian fever dreams and other lunacies from Silicon Valley’s best and brightest.

Love it, Wuk. And when that song came out, I was a 14 year-old Midwest teenager wishing I was old enough to drive to check it out. Surely it was a mix of good and bad, but there were things happening like the Monterey Pop Festival, the Be-In, the Houseboat Summit and the kool-aid acid tests that I would like to have seen or participated in. Just the bands that were playing at the Fillmore or Monterey would have been amazing to see as they were forming and evolving. It would have been a different route. More New Buffalo Communes and fewer Waymos. Maybe your Burning Man, Wuk, preserves some part of that, but it seems to me we’re a lot closer to Dick’s and Scott’s vision of the future than the 60s San Francisco that MacKenzie was writing about. And I’ll throw in an Animals’ tune along the same lines. British bluesmen could dig the Summer of Love along with Americans. Thanks HMP, that song was crying out to be rearranged~ One thing about the 60’s is that money seemed to be irrelevant in all goings on, you could see a concert with 5 really good bands for a few bucks in the SF Bay area. Burning Man costs a bit for entry ticket and parking pass, and then money becomes ballast, in that the only thing you can buy on the playa is bags of ice, that’s it. So, it has some of that 60’s vibe going on, art for the sake of enjoyment-not enrichment. So Kagi came out with a game to help kids detect AI slop. There’s a sneaky group called the Slop Syndicate that’s trying to trick everyone! They use computers to make fake stories, pictures, and sounds that look real but aren’t. This is the state of the world in late 2025. We need a tool like this for kids to understand econo-priest speak as well, so that they can see through market worship. Anybody else notice the demise of the Xmas card? Used to get 30-35, up to 2 so far this season~ What, no tidings of DeJoy? I guess he is no longer in charge. I imagine that your cards will arrive with your 1098 and 1099’s at end of January. There apparently is a small groundswell emerging that some 2025 tax returns may be submitted- redacted. We really might run out of ink!! Same here. I still send ’em though. / ;) Mrs. Socialist makes me sign a bunch of hand-made cards every Christmas, but whether they get sent or not depends on if she can locate her address book in time. This Christmas it was a no, unfortunately. I had enough trouble just getting my gifts selected and purchased. I still have a few to go. Cards?!!??? remain beyond me yet another Christmas. I have not received any Christmas cards but I will send some next year if I can get my act together. I still send out some Solstice cards as I have for a half century I don’t send them out to get one back, just like making them and sending them out. For all of the attempts to destroy it, the USPS is still a great service. Denmark has solved that problem. You cannot send letters there anymore and they have removed all their mailboxes. You wanna send a Christmas card, send an email. But around here I noticed something more prosaic. Over the recent decades as friends and family pass away there is less and less people to send Christmas cards to so this year there are only a handful to send. Nobody told me that that would ever happen but I guess that it is inevitable. Same here. Many of the older generation I used to send cards to has passed on. The better half has decided we will switch to sending very pretty PDFs of Christmas cards that she designs. I really enjoyed watching the video embedded at the top of the links showing a traditional egg decorating technique. Thanks for sharing that. I also enjoyed the video. The work shown was amazingly precise showing the great skill of the person creating the egg. It looked like something to start practicing for next year’s Christmas. Technically the traditional egg decoration is for the Easter (spring, resurrection etc). Nothing really preventing one from doing for Christmas, though. It’s a living tradition so change, appropriation and assimilation do apply. Latest from Eric Salzman at Racket News. no paywall.

I’m speechless. I bet Xi is pissed. No magnets for Xmass… A drop in church attendance preceded the opioid epidemic: “Long before opioids flooded communities, something else was quietly changing—and it may have helped set the stage for today’s crisis. A new study finds that as church attendance dropped among middle-aged, less educated white Americans, deaths from overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related disease began to rise. The trend started years before OxyContin appeared, suggesting the opioid epidemic intensified a problem already underway.” https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251219093317.htm Maybe some independent factor caused both the drop in attendance and the opioid epidemic. Or maybe a fair number of people are better off attending church than not, no matter how wart-ridden the church inevitably is or what they believe. I’m not sure how one would set up a study to determine which it is. I would add that too many of the preachers in these congregations served neither to educate their parishioners to some of the realities of their existence nor did they advocate publicly for their interests. Instead, many of their preachers reinforced the status quo that was crushing these people with their preaching and considered themselves upstanding members of their local communities in terms of their memberships and friendships. First, the church often left them. Losing that membership in the community may well have been an important contributor to the epidemic. It wasn’t weekly exposure to the preaching of fire and brimstone. Spiritual Fitness Inventory User Guide US Army Public Health Command, Technical Guide No. 360 [2012] Even if a particular church left people, they could have still gone to a different church, or formed a new one. In many denominations the members choose their own pastor (or in the case of my denomination, have no paid pastor; everyone is a pastor). I’m not convinced that the cause was bad pastors. It seems like a little much to expect some one person to “educate” parishioners to the realities of their existence; I wouldn’t expect that of a pastor even if my denomination had them. I’m just not sure why people stopped attending. In my part of the country I did see social snobbery being a factor; religion was seen as being for the uneducated. Lack of community and peer to peer support in a world of neoliberalism and unaffordable or underfunded social services is a recipe for disaster. I don´t sympathize with that claim at least at its face value. There were also anecdotes where in the light of lacking support from state (as DEA colluded with Purdue) victims turned to church where prayers were supposed to solve the problem of addiction! The thing that did the trick was organizing and the FBI connecting the dots, to my knowledge. That doesn´t mean “church” doesn´t help in certain context. But then “church” is just the representation for something else. Call it solidarity, call it community organising, local social services. It´s risky to think religion helps where in fact it is serious shortcomings and corruption in rich societies. In fact Purdue abused such indicators as poverty or “decency” to claim why victims of Oxy had become addicted. NOT actually Oxy. That´s is not unlike claiming “well it´s all due to the loss of values that our kids are taking drugs”. i.e. it´s their fault. The less solidarity in a society because its dismantled by its elites the more religion is supposed to step in. Eventually an Emmanuel Todd says that the demise of religion is directly connectet with the demise of societies. I.don´t.think.so. Forgive me but to cease this dependency on religion as it was established in the Soviet system was progressive achievement. (it was other issues that didn´t work.) Thanks for the link. From the article: “The researchers found a clear pattern at the state level. States that experienced the sharpest drops in church attendance between 1985 and 2000 also saw the largest increases in deaths from these causes during the same period.” Now what else was happening in the US during that time period – 1985 to 2000? My very first thought is that was when the big push to move factory jobs offshore or from northern states more expensive labor to southern states less expensive labor, the difference being the rate of factory labor unionization between northern and southern states. Moving manufacturing to Mexico and Vietnam and later to China. People were told to move from places like Detroit and Dearborn to places where the work was. Or told to accept lower wages or the company would move the factory jobs to another state or to another country. Either accept lower wages or quit and ‘learn to code’. Working class people were economically whipsawed by this threat for many years. People were uprooted, displaced, financially distressed, and moving into a new community when feeling desperate, maybe a second or third move, could I imagine leave one in a state of turmoil. Finding a new church to attend and join might have been the last thing on the mind if wondering just how long one might live in the new city. Shorter, it started during the Reagan years of outsourcing and downsizing that put families on the move looking for work. / my 2 cents And putting too fine a point on this, I’m thinking of the US’s internal great migration of farmers and farm labor, dispossessed of their farms and labor during the Great Depression, on a constant move looking for work. I don’t think many of them looked to join a new church during those terrible years when they were on the move. No stability, no knowing how long they’d be in any place if they did find work. Dorothea Lange made a series of famous photos for the Farm Security Administration in FDR’s administration. You’d recognize the pictures. Search on the term “Dorothea Lange”. But church attendance dropped among people who stayed put. And it dropped in areas like my home region of New England that weren’t affected in the same way by Reaganomics. And it used to be that when people moved to a new area the first thing they did was look for a church for support. I agree about the badness of Reagonomics and its dislocations but I think there may be something more. Pretty sure Space X gets a tax wright off for the CyberTrucks. That will be some form 179. Here I was wrestling with the older eurovans clocking in below 6K GVW. It’s all a matter of scale, no? With Elroy, it is almost also like a stock-buy-back. My bet: He got a discount-to-MSRP ro deal, books the sale, never pays a penny, sells to Guvvy for their Venezuelan ground transpo at 150 % of MSRP (Military Pro deal) , but graciously throws in solar charge stations. So many headlines to anticipate for 2026!! Maybe that will offset the cost of exploding rockets. / heh. RE: Roomba’s and ebikes. . . Rad ebikes dominate the ebike category in my town. They start at $1k for the model parents are buying for their kids (as young as 9 y.o.). The town council has now created administrative fines for the reckless riding the youngsters create. The fines are payable by the parents. Needless to say this market for ebikes is shrinking. Older adults buy the more expensive models, but after less than a year realize an ebike is the prey for distracted automobile drivers. One local dealer told me that 40% of buyers want help selling their purchase in the first year of ownership. (I own an expensive Class 3 ebike that is stored in the City run Bike Spot indoor parking; there are ebikes next to mine that have not been ridden in the last 6 months.) It’s not just the tariffs that are depressing the market. E-bikes are so dangerous in the hands of a kid or adult, as I see them rather silently almost keeping up with cagers, often in their blind spot. In Brooklyn they are known to burn down buildings due to off market chargers and lithium batteries. There’s a reason why some people don’t park their Tesla in the garage. It does seem I see fewer ebikes on my trails these days. And on the street even motorcycles are quite dangerous because of the visibility problem. “They graduated from Stanford. Due to AI, they can’t find a job – Los Angeles Times” This is a complete farce. AI is not replacing people. AI is not responsible for new grads being unable to find tech jobs. It’s Indians. Indians and other mass migrants via fraudulent visas. This is congruent with the adage that AI means “Actually, Indians”. Ukraine Receives Last of 80 Promised Abrams Tanks: How Many Are Left and How Well Can They Be Sustained? Military Watch I’m calling bullshit. No-one is signing off sending 80 $25 million turbine powered tanks to be obliterated by 200 $1500 drones within 96 hours. The total budget for the endless drone destruction music videos and edits over the next 5 years remixes won’t even exceed the paperwork budget for shipping this many tanks into Ukraine. It makes more sense to relegate the tanks to bulldozer duty behind the lines than to do this. Probably they are being shipped somewhere else, or being sold by the Ukrainians to someone else, or are for conquering Poland. I simply cannot believe even the Nato MIC would send this much (relatively) good hardware in after bad. I doubt that those tanks are for the present conflict. Instead, they will be the nucleus of a more powerful tank force for the Ukrainian army that will be built up after the Russians sign Minsk 3. Then when NATO gets its planned 2030 war against Russia, they will be at the forefront of the new attack against the Russians. Now we just need to have the Russians cooperate more… re: Protonmail leaves Switzerland use google-tranlsate Proton leaves Switzerland: CEO warns of surveillance state https://tarnkappe.info/artikel/it-sicherheit/datenschutz/proton-verlaesst-die-schweiz-ceo-warnt-vor-ueberwachungsstaat-324338.html “Proton has begun relocating its infrastructure from Switzerland.

Title: Job seekers in 2025 faced a Great Frustration: never-ending applications, ghosting after interviews, and losing hope

Call it the Great Freeze — or the Great Frustration. Business Insider spoke with dozens of job seekers across generations in 2025, some of whom have been unemployed for more than a year. They voiced a wide range of frustrations about their searches — including slow hiring timelines, so-called "ghost jobs," suspected ageism, employers going silent midway through the process, overwhelming competition for each role, and the belief that AI filters are often screening their résumés before a human ever sees them. Their job-finding journeys come at a time when employers are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. Whether the job seekers blame AI, corporate efficiency pushes, or broader economic uncertainty, they say it all adds up to a deluge of applications and a dearth of job offers. Still, through the frustration, they've also found ways to cope and connect with a community of fellow job seekers. "I believe the hiring system is broken," said Matthew English, who's been looking for full-time work since October 2024 after a decadeslong career in accounting. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs — from accounting roles to the Chick-fil-A cow mascot — he's been unable to secure a full-time offer. He said he's burned through much of his savings, and that last Christmas, he couldn't afford to buy gifts for his family. "I have about drained my life's savings," said English, who is in his 60s and lives in Alabama. "Money that you're expecting to use in retirement is now being used to survive." The New York Fed regularly asks people to estimate the likelihood that, if they lost their job today, they'd be able to find a new one in the next three months. In August 2025, that average probability dropped to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013 — and has only recovered slightly in the months since. Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said 2025's labor market had "low momentum." "The cumulative effect of three years of slowdown — it's completely understandable why they feel like this might be the worst labor market they've ever been in," Kantenga said. Throughout the year, Business Insider has spoken with people who've worked at some of the world's most high-profile companies and found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations. Share your story by emailing jzinkula@businessinsider.com or mhoff@businessinsider.com. Read more on the topic: Hilary Nordland began looking for work after being laid off from her marketing role in July 2024. To help pay the bills, she said she started donating plasma and drew on her retirement savings. Nordland, who's in her 50s and lives in Minnesota, said one of the most frustrating parts of her job search has been landing interviews — only to have opportunities fall through for unexpected reasons. She said she's had interviews canceled the same day they were scheduled because the role was suddenly put on hold or filled internally. On one occasion, she said, an HR representative told her she'd be a great fit — but the rep was fired before they could schedule the interview. "This job market is terrifying," she said. "It's a black hole that makes you question everything — and I don't see a clear path through." US employers have announced 1.17 million job cuts so far in 2025, the most since 2020. While the unemployment rate remains relatively low by historical standards, it has risen to its highest level since 2021, when the economy was still recovering from pandemic-related disruptions. High demand for jobs — combined with the rise of AI-assisted applications — has contributed to an influx of submissions for open roles, making it harder for qualified candidates to stand out. Last quarter, the average job posting received 242 applications, nearly three times the number in 2017, according to data from Greenhouse, a hiring software provider. Aaron Terrazas, an independent economist, said job seekers' frustration with this year's labor market was justified. "Just because the aggregate jobs data look stable, steady, slowing but stable, doesn't mean that it hasn't been very difficult for some people," Terrazas said. Heather Driscoll began looking for a healthcare management job after being laid off last year. She said she's struggled to pay the bills and had to draw on her 401(k). "The amount of time, research, enthusiasm — the dressing up, hair, makeup — just to sit on a Zoom call and get no feedback or rejection, is insane," she said. Driscoll, who's in her 50s and lives in Colorado, said she has reached the final interview round multiple times but has been unable to secure an offer. She suspects that ageism and sexism could be working against her. A challenging job market has forced some job seekers to confront the possibility that their goals and aspirations may be out of reach. At age 40, Kenneth Ferraro quit his job as a truck driver to pursue a bachelor's degree in political science at New York University. He hoped it would set him up for a career in public service — but after struggling to find work, he returned to trucking last year. He said he's stuck with more than $100,000 in student debt. While having a college degree improved his credentials, Ferraro said he thought his age had held him back in the job market. He recalled applying for an entry-level government position that seemed like a good fit. The early stages of the interview process felt promising, but he said things shifted after the in-person interview — and he suspects his age was a factor. "As soon as the hiring manager saw me, his whole demeanor changed," Ferraro said. "He ran through the questions and never truly engaged with me." Solomon Jones hoped that earning a college degree would open doors. After earning his bachelor's degree in sports communication in May, he struggled to find employment. Jones said that some of the sports communications job postings he'd come across had attracted more than 1,000 applicants. "The goal is to obviously get a job in the sports industry, but realistically, I know that life isn't fair," said Jones, who's in his 20s and lives in New Jersey. "So at this point, I'm just trying to find a job, period." Some job seekers Business Insider spoke with have leaned on others — including friends, family, professional contacts, and fellow job seekers — for support and solidarity during their job searches. After being laid off by Microsoft in May, Ian Carter struggled to find a new job. He switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment, but eventually moved to Florida to save money by living with family while continuing his search. Carter said he's connected with others who've lost their jobs and visits the private "MSFT Survivors" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout Microsoft's history. "Layoffs kind of affect people mentally," said Carter, who's in his 30s. "I've reached out to people so we can be each other's support system." In July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off by Intel for the second time. On his last official day with the company, his wife also lost her job. When he learned the news, his mindset shifted from "I'll find a job when I can" to "I'd better find a job." But over the past few months, he's struggled to make much headway. Ramkrishna said one of the things keeping him going is the support of his former Intel colleagues, who also lost their jobs. "Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support," said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. "It feels like we're all looking out for each other." Chris Martin, lead researcher at Glassdoor, said uncertainty helped drive this year's low-fire, low-hire job market, such as businesses navigating the effects of tariffs and AI. Terrazas, the independent economist, doesn't think uncertainty will fully fade next year, but said employers won't be facing the initial shock of policy changes from a new administration. Most job seekers can't afford to put their searches on hold until conditions improve. Despite the challenges, some have managed to break through. When Alexander Valen was laid off from his project manager role at Accenture, he was initially optimistic that his more than two decades of experience would help him land a new job. But after nearly two years of job searching — and falling behind on his mortgage — that optimism had vanished. Valen, who's in his 50s and lives in Florida, said he and his wife, a stay-at-home mom, relied on DoorDash earnings, unemployment benefits, and help from family to get by. But a few months ago, someone in his network recommended he explore roles at the freelance platform Toptal. Valen applied for a project manager role, went through the interview process, and landed the position, which he said fell within the $80 to $100 an hour compensation range he'd been targeting. Valen's top advice for other job seekers: Reframe how you view the process — and lean on others along the way. "The search becomes far less discouraging when you treat it as an opportunity to grow rather than a verdict on your worth," he said. "And in a market this competitive, networking isn't optional — it's the force multiplier that ultimately led me to my role." Jump to

December 21, 2025 03:04 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its 21st Electron rocket of the year to deploy the latest satellite to space for multi-launch customer Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space, Inc. (iQPS), a Japan-based Earth imaging company. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission launched from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 21 at 7:36 p.m. (06:36 UTC) to deploy the QPS-SAR-15 to space for iQPS. The spacecraft will join the company’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation providing near-real time imagery across twelve different orbits for iQPS’ global customers. Rocket Lab first launched for iQPS in 2023 and has gone on to deploy seven satellites to the iQPS constellation, making Electron the primary launcher for iQPS. A further five launches on Electron for iQPS are planned from 2026. Today’s mission has set a new annual launch record for Electron: 21 launches in one year with 100% mission success. The record cements Electron as both America’s preeminent small launch provider and the world’s most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Congratulations to iQPS on this latest successful mission for their constellation, and to the Rocket Lab team on a fantastic record-setting year of Electron launches. Electron makes frequent and reliable launch look easy as it outpaces all other American small-lift orbital rockets, year after year. In 2026, we’re expanding Electron’s global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security. Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions go to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry, and we’re looking forward to another year of continued execution in 2026.” ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ mission was Rocket Lab’s 79th overall Electron mission and final scheduled launch for 2025. The next Electron launch is slated to take place in early Q1 2026. ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch images: F79 | The Wisdom God Guides ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ launch broadcast: Rocket Lab - ‘The Wisdom God Guides’ Launch Rocket Lab Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Title: Dalkey woman could decide if Netflix-Warner Bros merger goes ahead

Time Published: 2025-12-21T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
With Netflix and Paramount both vying to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the suits of the entertainment industry are on manoeuvres in Washington, seeking a kindly nod from US president Donald Trump for their billion-dollar proposals. An Irish person is involved. Gail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the all-powerful US Department of Justice is, conveniently for this column, from Dalkey, south Co Dublin. The UCD law graduate retains dual citizenship and is generating increased attention in the US as she wrestles with a slate of high-profile mergers. It’s a mixed picture for corporate bigwigs under Trump 2: some of the tough love dispensed by Joe Biden’s then-32-year-old anti-monopoly watchdog Lina Khan has dissipated and companies have resumed eating each other in pursuit of economies of scale. But that’s not necessarily popular among the meat-and-potatoes Maga masses. Slater is married to a former chief of staff to a Republican congressman from Idaho and worked as an adviser on big tech in the first Trump White House. She cuts a relatively hardline figure and has made clear that she believes in “America First antitrust”, which means standing up for “Main Street not Wall Street”, as Trump has put it in the past. The job is made harder, as the New York Times has pointed out, by the fact that Trump himself keeps taking positions on matters before the court, including saying he would be “involved” in the decision on the proposed Netflix-Warner merger. “I think a big challenge for Gail is, how impulsive will the president be?” William Kovacic, a former mergers watchdog, told Politico in a profile of Slater. “You can’t say, ‘My God, shut up,’ because then you’re fired. So you cross your fingers and hope you’re not a target.” Another person making waves abroad is author Stephen Rea – not the actor, though equally from Belfast – who has just published Ozzy & Me, a memoir of his relationship with Ozzy Osbourne. Rea grew up during the height of the Troubles and amid the chaos, including an incident during which his house was shot at by gunmen, he found refuge in music. Controversial Irish-language electro-rap troupes had not yet been invented at that stage, so he turned to the next best thing: heavy metal. Aged 15, he noticed a music magazine write-up of Rock in Rio, a giant metal festival featuring Ozzy, AC/DC and Queen set to take place in Brazil. His father, in the most magnanimous decision ever made by the father of a teenager, said they should go. Perplexed as to how to go about this, his mother wrote to Osbourne’s secretary, who promptly responded with VIP passes. Rea went, met Osbourne and struck up a 40-year friendship with the family. Rea, whose demonstrable ability to take a leap of faith has most recently taken him to New Orleans, secured a foreword from Jack Osbourne, who watchers of early 2000s MTV reality show The Osbournes will remember as Ozzy’s son, though watchers of a more recent reality TV show, I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, might know him better from that. Through decades of the metal hero’s career, Rea is in the room where it happens. At one point, in 1980s Glasgow, he recounts: “By 4am we were down to Randy [Rhoads, the bombastic lead guitarist], Geezer [Butler, bassist for both Black Sabbath and Ozzy’s solo material] , Ozzy, and me,” with “Randy throwing glasses against the wall and Geezer belting out Irish Catholic rebel tunes, Ozzy joining in though he didn’t know them.” Ozzy promises to write one for Rea. “That would have gone down well with my Protestant friends and family,” he muses. Good news for the groups of English men who often descend on Dublin to drink pints and shout at each other: JD Wetherspoon has cut a deal to supply Guinness to its Irish outlets. The divisive UK pub group, which trades on its low prices and impressive locations, has served the black stuff in Britain for a long time alongside its various curry deals and halves of Old Peculier (correct). But early in its foray into the Irish market in 2014, it decided that St James’s Gate was charging too much for its stout and struck it from the menu at the Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, south Dublin. Almost 12 years later, the deal has finally been done for its six outlets. Overheard rarely seeks refreshment at such establishments. But Guinness has been on a dramatic upsurge in popularity at home and abroad in recent years, with the Guardian even recently predicting that it will soon lose its cool in the UK – a sure sign it’s on a high. It must be surprising to stag party attendees and lost locals, therefore, to show up to Wetherspoons establishments only to be told they can’t have it, mere miles from its birthplace. A press release promises it’ll be on the menu imminently – although, of course, there are 6,000 other places you could get it all along. One tourist to Dublin this week was Greta Thunberg, the globally famous Swedish climate-and-Gaza activist who visited Áras an Uachtaráin and got up to various other activities related to her Palestinian solidarity activities. Thunberg has had a busy year, having sailed on a flotilla towards Gaza, near which she was intercepted and detained by Israel, alleging harsh treatment. A broad smile and a warm welcome from the President, therefore, given their similar interests. Overheard’s eye was caught by a striking battle scene in a painting behind Catherine Connolly and her activist visitor at Áras an Uachtaráin as they posed together. It depicts the Battle of Ballinahinch, an engagement in the 1798 rebellion. Painted by Thomas Robinson, its original title is Combat Between the King’s Troops and the Peasantry at Ballinahinch, and it is a contemporary depiction of the engagement, which saw the Presbyterian-led Co Down rebels take on the crown. Some 4,000 United Irishmen under Henry Munro lost the battle (and ultimately the war). Robinson – an English painter of Irish subjects who wowed the critics in Belfast and Dublin before dying in Jervis Street in 1810 – painted it up and it was raffled off. The Marquess of Hertford won it, but ultimately it came to the Office of Public Works (OPW) – and to the Áras, where the Lord Lieutentant Marquess Cornwallis might have mulled his troop movements many years ago. Still, despite early defeats the rebels, like President Connolly after her knockback in the Galway Labour Party, claimed victory in the end to some degree. Thunberg, aged just 22, has time yet. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Letters: State funding for penniless artists is always money well spent

Comedians can now apply for . Photo: Getty Madam — I write in response to Aidan Harte’s letter (‘Sinn Féin goes beyond satire by embracing subsidised comedy’, December 14). I have followed efforts by the members of the Irish comedy community, particularly Ailish McCarthy, to have comedy recognised as an art form. Mr Harte referred to “new spending”, but there is as yet no indication of this. What has changed is comedians can now apply for grants, along with playwrights, dancers, sculptors and painters. Until now, they were simply dismissed, because the legislation hadn’t included the word “comedy”. Incidentally, Mr Harte expressed a preference for right-wing comedy. I would encourage him to write a few right-wing zingers and pop along to an open mic and give them a go. The public will let him know if they’re funny. In terms of public funding, it’s true that not every piece of art is going to be a masterpiece, but the fact that the Arts Council supports the attempt is a good inclination towards the society I want to live in. Besides, the most successful music, art, film, video games and so on are built on the backs of fringe, often penniless, artists trying something that might inspire people. The penniless part is important there. The Basic Income for the Arts is a much-needed lifeline for the few individuals who have so far benefited from it. It was not “pushed through with little scrutiny” as Mr Harte suggested; it was trialled over an extended period, with success. There is an organisation called Minding Creative Minds that has data on just how high the rates of depression and suicide are in the arts, and it is staggering. If Basic Income for the Arts will not fix that altogether, but if it lifts the pressure and darkness off a handful of individuals and gives them the space to pay their rent and put food in their bellies and pursue the art that the very heart of them demands they do, then I think it’s an incredibly worthwhile investment. Why make it any harder for the people who just want to paint for you, or dance for you, or make you laugh? Aidan O’Sullivan, Dublin Madam — I am aghast at Ciara Kelly’s column (‘Ceasefire in Gaza may be imperfect, but to what end do we boycott and sanction Israel after the peace plan has been brokered?’, Life, December 14). I am incredulous that anyone believes now is the time to ease pressure on Benjamin Netanya­hu’s regime, simply because there’s a faux ceasefire in place that Israel violates every day. The point of sanctioning and boycotting this regime isn’t about “punishing them” for the last two years. It’s beyond belief that any observer or comment­ator on the Middle East would suggest this. The so-called ceasefire and peace plan are designed to do nothing more than encourage journalists like Ciara to write articles like the one published last week, to encourage people to move on: nothing to see here any more. We can’t move on, because that’s what the Israeli regime wants us to do. We can’t move on because the genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, human rights violations, breaches of international law, building of settlements, terrorism by sett­lers, land grabbing, abuse and torture of hostages (described by our media as “detainees”, including children), controlled starvation of Gazans continues. Sanctions allied with econo­mic, social, cultural and sporting boycotts of this disgusting regime are not just the only way to bring pressure on Netanyahu’s genocidal regime and bring about change in Israel; they are also the only morally respon­sible thing to do. Brendan Farrell, Kildare Madam — Hours after reading Michael Jordan’s egregious letter (December 14), the news came through of the Islamist killings at a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach in Sydney, celebrating Hanukkah. Michael Jordan has a problem with Jews living in Israel, their biblical homeland, where, in spite of historical expulsions and dispersions, there remained throughout history a Jewish presence. It is not possible to be anti- Zionist, anti-Israel and not be anti-Jewish. Israel, with a 77pc Jewish population, is not “an ethno­cracy”, unless the Republic of Ireland with a non-immigrant population of 78pc can be classed as such. On the contrary, both are democratic states. Ena Keye, Rathfarnham, Dublin Madam — Last Sunday, I read a letter to the editor by Michael Jordan, denying Jews the right to a homeland of their own, followed by learning of another example of “globalising the intifada” on Bondi Beach. It is sad to see the lack of historical knowledge and empathy about why Jews had to establish their own state. Frank Devine, Kenilworth, Warwickshire Madam — While the late justice minister Paddy Cooney was a great “law and order” man during the 1970s (‘Fine Gael TD and Justice Minister renowned for hard line on IRA during Troubles’, December 14), he was also liberal. The prevailing Adoption Act, a relic of 1952 as amended, in effect prevented childless couples in “mixed marriages” where one spouse was Catholic and the other of any other or no religion from adopting a child. It was the product of a very Catholic Ireland and was self-­evidently ­unconstitutional, because the State may not discriminate on grounds of ­religion. As one of a mixed marriage, albeit with our own children, I was conscious of the wounds that would befall couples in childless, mixed marriages who were not permitted to adopt. So, as a newbie to politics, I moved a proposal at the Fine Gael annual conference in Cork in June, 1972, calling for reform of the Adoption Act. It was approved. Two years later, in 1974, Mr Cooney successfully introduced the reforming legislation. Today, the civil act of adopting a child is free of religious impediment. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — I was told in my local pharmacy last week that doses of the flu vaccine were in short supply, due to demand. So why are the HSE and the Medical Council not doing more to advocate the use of face masks and more vigorous hand-sanitising? One of the most effective ways of containing flu or any other infective virus this Christmas is to wear a mask, especial­ly in crowded places or on public transport. Often the most effective solutions are the simplest. Brian Lube, Co Meath Madam — While having sympathy for people who have gender dysphoria, a solely ­activist-led approach to care would be no way to run any medical programme, which should be based on scientific evidence (‘I bear the scars of a healthcare system that fails trans people’, December 7). As the Cass Report noted, social transition is “not a neutral act”. Children do not have the capacity to consent to puberty blockers and opposite sex hormones that will affect their fertility and health for life. Trans activists may claim to want bodily autonomy, and may be supported by “progressive” politicians, but I do not think our poorly resourced health service should be removing breasts and mutilating the genitals of healthy adults, just because someone requests it. Medicine and medical treatments should always be evidence-based and doctors should “do no harm”. Helen Robinson, Blackrock, Dublin Madam — While “peace and goodwill to all men” is the order of the day at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends seeking shelter from the cold wintry winds, severe frost, foggy nights and heavy rain in our garden hedgerows. Looking out at our bird-feeder one day recently and discovering it was empty, I immediately topped it up. Almost instantly, the birds emerged from their many hiding places and descended at speed to gobble up the food. As I sat at a discreet distance, observing them as they ate heartily, a cock robin perched close by, observing the feeding frenzy, master of all he surveyed. So, as the robin adorns our greetings cards at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends who come to stay with us each year, and provide them all with a generous helping of goodies each day. Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo Madam — I agree with Sarah Breen that Australia has the right idea with its social media ban for under-16s (‘Let’s follow Australia on social media’, Dec­ember 14). As a clinician for more than 25 years, I have seen that the number of young people att­ending counselling has exponentially risen as a result of the use of phones. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — Has the role of the RTÉ Guide been usurped by the Sunday Independent? Four articles over three pages (including the front page) in last Sundays paper — are people really interested in the employment arrangements of those highly paid individuals in Montrose? Harry Mulhern, Dublin 13 Madam — It’s impressive for any institution to last 120 years, but for a newspaper it borders on heroic (‘120 years of Sundays — and some things stay the same’, December 14). The Sunday Independent has survived revolutions, censorship, political fury and commercial pressure. That alone deserves congratulations. As a child at Tullysaran Chapel, I remember the papers laid out for sale on a Sunday morning: the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press, two confident piles. No imported English scandal sheets shouting for attention, just Irish voices arguing loudly with one another. It felt like a small but important civic ritual. Over its 120 years, the Sunday Independent has informed, irritated and occasionally infuriated its readers. I read pieces that make me want to spit. That is the point. Democracy is not meant to be soothing, and freedom of speech rarely is. At a time when governments dodge scrutiny and tech olig­archs would prefer not to be accountable at all, it is journalists, in the Sunday Independent and elsewhere, who continue to ask the awkward questions. They do so under pressure, often under attack, and with diminishing resources. They deserve more credit than they get. Long may the Sunday Independent endure, and long may there be a free, unfettered press that refuses to behave itself. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In the vein of former Sunday Independent editor and fellow Kerryman Aengus Fanning’s diktat of “tell it as it is, no matter what the cost”, outlined in Liam Collins’s lively reflection of over a century of publication, I’d like to add my own tuppence worth. A few months ago, an acquaintance asked was I the McElligott that “writes” in the Sunday Indepen­dent. I replied bashfully that I have been known to fire off the odd missive. Wishing all your readers and my fellow wordsmiths a very happy Christmas. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘When politicians have to plead with judges, democracy is in danger’, December 14) frames the debate about the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as a “fight” between elected politicians and an “ideologically committed” judiciary. The contention that judiciary activism is at fault for the curr­ent deadlock is to understate the political disagreements between the 46 members of the Council of Europe. A meeting is planned for next for May to discuss the application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Normally, there would be behind-the-door diplomacy and compromise before the summit. These negotiations would form the basis of a political declaration, which the conference would ratify. The recent politic­al declaration by 26 countries, including Ireland, was high-stakes diplomacy. It is an expli­cit acknowledgment that there is significant discord. It was not a plea to the judges. It was a public power play for the May meeting. It was significant that countries such as France, Germany and Spain did not sign it. The COE statute requires “important matters”, such as political declarations, to be unanimous. A “decision” on the interpretation of the convention by the ECtHR requires a two-thirds majority, or 31 members. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Bernie Linnane refers to “the compassionate, accepting and kind Irish public who decided to trust women (regarding abortion) to make their own decision about their own bodies” (Letters, December 14). I wonder how these people view the shocking fact that more than 50,000 abortions have taken place here since the 2018 referendum, despite assur­ances by the Yes side that they would be “rare”. Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town Madam — The picture of a seated Donald Trump shaking hands with Zohran Mamdanmi accompanying Declan Lynch’s column (‘To stand up to Trump, all we need is a backbone’, December 14) raises two protocol issues. One should not remain seated while shaking hands, nor should one place one’s free hand on top of the one involved in the “shake”. Mind you, I doubt if Donald would even consider holding up his hands and admitting his gaffe. In summary, a whole lot of shaking going wrong. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont Dublin 9 Madam — Like Gerry Hickey (Letters, December 14), I have had my fill of filler phrases like “you know”. But it’s the ubiquitous “in relation to” that comes out tops with me, often occurring multiple times in the same media utterance by seasoned communicators. Tony O’Neill, Bishopstown, Co Cork Madam — I find it bemusing that politicians, chief execut­ives and others of that ilk always seem to find it necessary to start an answer with the phrase: “Let me be quite clear.” I have never heard any interviewer finish a question by stating: “I want total lack of clarity in your response.” So let’s have no more “Let me be quite clear” and just be clear. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s price rebound as BlackRock shifts $109M in ETH

Large ETH transfers surfaced after the rally, but conviction across markets stayed thin. Ethereum’s recent rebound attracted institutional and whale attention, with several large holders moving ETH to exchanges after the rally. The activity followed ETH’s sharp move higher after the Bank of Japan’s 25 basis point rate hike. That behavior raised questions over whether large players expected near-term downside or were simply rotating capital after gains. Crypto transaction tracker Onchain Lens reported on X that BlackRock deposited 36,579 ETH, worth about $108.4 million, into Coinbase over the past 24 hours. The post also showed that BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes sent 680 ETH, valued near $2.03 million, to Binance, a move often associated with potential selling. Whale activity often draws attention because large transfers can influence short-term price direction. Traders frequently track these wallets for clues around sentiment shifts or liquidity needs. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded near $2,980, up about 0.85% over 24 hours. Spot market participation, however, weakened during the same period. Trading volume fell 52% to roughly $18.47 billion, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. That slowdown contrasted with derivatives positioning. Even so, Open Interest rose 2.46% to $38.51 billion, indicating traders added leveraged positions despite muted spot activity. That divergence suggested positioning rather than organic demand drove recent price stability. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the daily chart revealed that ETH was consolidating in a tight range between $2,790 and $3,000. Meanwhile, the broader market structure remains in a downward trend. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, a major rally in ETH would likely be possible only if it breaks out of this tight consolidation range. If the broader trend continues and the price breaches and closes a daily candle below the $2,790 level, it could trigger strong downside momentum. Conversely, if the trend shifts and the altcoin closes a daily candle above the $3,000 level, it could signal an end to the prolonged downward momentum. Besides these key levels, the momentum strength indicator Average Directional Index (ADX) has reached 30.39, above the key threshold of 25, indicating a strong directional trend in the asset. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has further reinforced the bearish outlook, as its value dropped to -0.05, signaling rising selling pressure and capital outflows from the asset.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." This week, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." This week, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program.

Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." This week, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

Title: Pick up 2025's most underrated RPG during the Steam Winter Sale
URL: https://www.xda-developers.com/sunderfolk-recommendation-steam-winter-sale/
Time Published: 2025-12-20T17:30:18Z

There's certainly no shortage of choice when it comes to what to buy during the Steam Winter Sale. Hundreds, if not thousands, of games are available for cheaper than ever before. While the Featured Deep Discounts and sales for some of the biggest games of the year are worth looking at, the Steam Winter Sale is also a great time to get some of 2025's most underrated games. Specifically, for fans of tabletop role-playing games and games that explore the different ways we interact with the medium, I'd highly recommend Secret Door and Dreamhaven's Sunderfolk. Typically $50, Sunderfolk is discounted by 40% to just $30 during this Steam Winter Sale. If you're willing to use your phone to control a tactics RPG with some friends, you'll discover one of the most underrated games of the year. In 2020, former Activision Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime founded Dreamhaven, a new game publisher and parent company to multiple development studios. Sunderfolk was the first internally developed game that they released, and it was quite the bold swing for a first game. It's a cooperative, turn-based tactical RPG meant to be a digital replacement for your tabletop board game night. In it, you play as cute animals who fit classic RPG archetypes like tank, warrior, and mage, and go on missions with your friends to save the home village of Arden. I personally like playing as the Pyromancer, a salamander that powers up by stepping into the fire his attacks leave behind on tiles. Actress Anjali Bhimani also put in impressive work for Sunderfolk, voicing every single character and the narrator in the game. The one catch, if you want to call it that, in all of this is that you have to use an app on your phone to control your character in Sunderfolk. Your on-screen cursor movement, move selection, and character upgrades between missions are all handled from a smartphone screen. That may sound gimmicky and off-putting to some, but buy in and you'll actually find this setup feels surprisingly intuitive. Mechanically, it's an impressive tactics game, with varied mission objectives, unique player abilities, and creative ways for players to interact and assist one another. If you can wrangle up a group of friends to play the game (only one copy is required), it truly offers some of the most fun of any multiplayer game released in 2025. It's even possible to play it alone, although that's not ideal. Regardless, Sunderfolk is an incredibly charming game that I wish more people knew about. While I really enjoy Sunderfolk and its Jackbox-meets-D&D approach to multiplayer RPG gaming, it was not an overnight success for Dreamhaven following its launch in April of this year. According to a Bloomberg report, it sold only about 62,000 copies in its first four months on the market. Its Android app has 100,000+ downloads. Layoffs did occur at Dreamhaven in August. I credit Sunderfolk's underperformance to a couple of different factors. First, it's hard to convince hardcore RPG video game fans to adopt such a complex way to play a new RPG due to the stigma surrounding mobile games. Meanwhile, tabletop gamers chose to stick with their physical games. It also didn't help that Sunderfolk launched on April 23, the same week The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. As players had two fantastic RPGs, capitalizing on nostalgia to choose from, something as experimental as Sunderfolk didn't capture players' attention like those titles did. This game is at its best when multiple people are convinced to play it over an extended period of time. The time and interest buy-in required, and the release timing, just didn't work in Sunderfolk's favor. That makes a quiet late December for new game releases the perfect time to release it. To Secret Door and Dreamhaven's credit, they also haven't abandoned the game. Its app is still operational, and a free trial for those curious but not convinced is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. A post-launch update added the ability to do one-shot missions rather than a whole campaign, while an update next year is set to add a new playable character, more missions, and even the ability to play the game with mouse and keyboard rather than a phone. That support gives me the confidence to recommend Sunderfolk at its current 40% discount. If you missed out on Sunderfolk around the time it was released, it's worth picking up now that it's just $30 during the Steam Winter Sale. For those who are still skeptical of using a phone as a controller, I recommend trying the free trial first; you'll come away impressed. You could also wait to play it until keyboard and mouse controls are added next year, but still buy it at a discount now. So many games fall through the cracks of the gaming zeitgeist every year, and Sunderfolk is one that deserves another chance. While throwback RPGs are comfort food, something like Sunderfolk is innovating the ways that keep the genre interesting. Phone interesting may not catch on outside of Netflix or Amazon Luna's casual games, but some other game design ideas from this game can live on in future RPGs. $30 is more than worth it if you want to play a game that's trying something new and not just iterating on the same old concepts.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/brazils-largest-asset-manager-recommends-investors-put-up-to-3-of-their-money-in-bitcoin-to-hedge-against-fx-market-shocks/
Time Published: 2025-12-20T17:00:00Z

The recommendation is in line with other global asset managers like BlackRock and Bank of America suggesting small portfolio allocations to the largest cryptocurrency. Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

Title: IBIT ranking 6th in 2025 ETF flows despite negative returns is ‘a really good sign’
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-ibit-ranks-sixth-etf-flows-negative-returns
Time Published: 2025-12-20T11:54:00Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranked sixth in 2025 ETF inflows despite posting a negative annual return, a signal analysts say reflects long-term conviction. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has ranked sixth in net inflows despite being the only fund in the top cohort posting a negative return for the year. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows IBIT pulling in roughly $25 billion in year-to-date inflows, even as its annual performance sits in the red. By comparison, several traditional equity and bond ETFs ahead of IBIT on the leaderboard posted double-digit gains, while gold-backed ETF GLD, which is up more than 60% on the year, attracted less capital than IBIT. Balchunas described the result as a “really good sign” over the long term, arguing that the flows reveal more about investor behavior than short-term price action. “If you can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year,” he wrote, pointing to what he called a “HODL clinic” from older, long-term investors. Related: BlackRock IBIT Bitcoin ETF achieves $70B AUM record Meanwhile, one crypto market participant questioned why sustained institutional buying through ETFs has not translated into stronger price performance. In response, Balchunas suggested the market may be behaving more like a mature asset class, where early holders take profits and deploy income strategies, such as selling call options, rather than chasing immediate upside. He also noted Bitcoin had risen more than 120% the previous year, tempering expectations for continuous gains. On Friday, US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $158 million in net outflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC the only fund to post inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $75.9 million in outflows, extending their losing streak to seven consecutive days. Related: BlackRock's most profitable ETF is now a 'hair away' from $100B BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF faced heavy pressure in November, with its flagship IBIT fund recording about $2.34 billion in net outflows, including two large withdrawal days mid-month. Despite the pullback, BlackRock executives downplayed concerns. Speaking at Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo, BlackRock business development director Cristiano Castro said the firm’s Bitcoin ETFs have become one of its largest revenue drivers. He argued that ETFs are designed to facilitate capital allocation and cash-flow management, making periods of compression and outflows normal.

Title: We Have Reached the Emily Litella Moment on Climate Change

It’s been a cold winter so far in the Midwest and much of the Northeast, early-in-the-season snow even in Washington, D.C., and temperatures falling to freezing and below in much of the South. Come to think of it, North America’s 2024-25 winter was pretty cold, too. It’s gotten to the point that “polar vortex” is a phrase on just about everyone’s lips. Of course, you are surely aware—as those of us with doubts about inevitably disastrous global warming were often told—that there’s a difference between weather and climate. Weather is anecdote, climate is longstanding trend. And the longstanding trend in climate, we have been told this entire past quarter-century, is toward a hotter climate all over the world, with multiple catastrophic consequences. Now, we seem to have reached an Emily Litella moment—the moment when, on the now half-century-old “Saturday Night Live” program, the befuddled character realized that she had misheard and misinterpreted some anodyne comment and had been propounding an absurd theory, and dismissed it with a hurried, “Never mind.” Playing the Litella role this October was Bill Gates, who, as a mega-philanthropist, makes serious efforts to gauge whether the causes to which he has contributed have been worth the money. Although “climate change will have serious consequences,” he said, using the two-word phrase that replaced global warming as it was becoming apparent that Earth wasn’t uniformly warming in line with predictions, “it will not lead to humanity’s demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.” Numbered also among the converts—the use of religious metaphor is not accidental; more below—is Breakthrough Institute research director Ted Nordhaus. “I used to argue that if the world kept burning fossil fuels at current rates, catastrophe was virtually assured,” he wrote this fall in The Free Press. “I no longer believe this hyperbole.” He pointed out that the demographic and physical factors on which he based his predictions two decades ago have not come to pass, and that despite measurable warming, some of which is attributable to human activity, people have adapted, and any damage has been well short of catastrophic. As British science writer Matt Ridley notes, claims such as Al Gore’s 2006 prediction of a 20-foot sea-level rise in 20 years have fallen short—by 19 feet and 9 inches. Meanwhile, the undermining of hyperbolic scenarios has, as Wall Street Journal economics reporter Greg Ip wrote this week, led the likes of Canadian Prime Minister (and former British central banker) Mark Carney and BlackRock DEO Larry Fink to downplay the risks of climate change, as most American voters have done some time ago. In all this, I see elements of religious conversion. Advocates of drastic action to address global warming climate change tend to be secular in religion but religious in their devotion to their cause. We have sinned, with our SUVs and corporate jets frying the Earth; we must atone by reducing our (or others’) standards of living; we must faithfully perform daily rituals, adjusting our thermostats and sorting our trash for recycling. The science writer John Tierney reports that The New York Times received a record number of letters in response to his 1996 article that it was economically and environmentally wasteful. It was like telling traditional Catholics their rosaries were a waste of time. For many Americans of a certain age, any change in the climate they remember from the summer when they were 16 is a change for the worse, just like any change from the playlist of songs they remember from that glorious summer. Satellite radio programmers and canned music providers in shopping malls provide the music from that golden moment, and politicians promising to halt climate change promise to provide the golden weather. But my impression is that those musical offerings are, like the baby boomer generation, getting scarcer, and certainly the demand in the political marketplace for restoration of that golden summer’s weather climate seems to have grown weaker too. This is operating within a larger cultural trend, an increasing skepticism of science and scientists. Earlier this month, as a Wall Street Journal editorial was among the few to emblazon, the journal Nature retracted a study that projected climate change could lead to a 62% economic decline by 2100. Among the factors that skewed the results threefold was the 1995-99 data from Uzbekistan. You can almost hear Litella saying, “Never mind.” Such shoddiness seems amusing, at least until you consider the “replication crisis” in which scientists have been unable to replicate the results of dozens of peer-reviewed and journal-published experiments, some of them famous like the Stanford prison experiment. And then there was the effort, successful during the COVID-19 crisis, by National Institutes of Health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, to suppress the now generally accepted theory that the virus spread because of a leak from the lab in Wuhan, China, whose gain-of-function research, deliberately strengthening viruses, was subsidized despite a ban by former President Barack Obama in 2014. So, the public’s skepticism of science and scientists is not surprising, though it’s surely having some unfortunate effects. People can see that expert recommendations, pushed by teachers unions, to close schools despite children’s negligible COVID-19 risk have resulted in long-lasting learning loss. And they are seeing one prominent preacher after another of environmental doom from climate change suddenly saying, like Litella, “Never mind.” COPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM We publish a variety of perspectives.

Here's your firmware update for December 20, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's almost the end of 2025, but the tech news shows no sign of stopping. We have seven more essential stories you need to catch up on from iRobot, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. The biggest amongst our seven include Meta trashing its third-party VR headsets, and iRobot going bankrupt, and to catch up on both of those and five more stories, you simply need to scroll down. When you're done, you might also want to catch up on some of the big streaming hits you missed, seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. The iRobot Roomba was a pioneer of robot vacuums, with the first model launched in 2002. Sadly, hot competition in the robovac space forced iRobot to declare bankruptcy this week – but that isn’t the end of the much-loved brand. It’s been acquired by Picea Robotics, a company that had already been building Roombas for iRobot. For now, iRobot says there’ll be no immediate changes for Roomba owners to worry about, and the vacuums will continue to work as usual. The future, though, is a bit more uncertain, and iRobot’s co-founder Colin Angle told us the bankruptcy is “a tragedy for consumers." ChatGPT has been steadily gathering some handy plug-ins for the likes of Photoshop and Kayak over the past few months – and this week, OpenAI gathered them all in an app store for us to peruse. The ‘Apps directory’, which is available in the app or on the web, already has a number of useful options, including Spotify and AllTrails. Once you’ve added them, you can call on the apps inside your ChatGPT conversations to create playlists or discover new hiking routes. We’ve rounded up our early favorites below. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The latest episode of the hit entertainment drama we hate to love aired this week: Warner Bros. Discovery announced its head hasn’t been turned by the advances of Paramount – instead, it remains faithful to its true love, Netflix. But much like a rom-com franchise being milked dry, this won’t be the last we see of this love triangle dynamic. This was just the WBD execs rejecting the offer and highlighting its issues in a letter to their shareholders – WBD stock owners could still choose to sell out to Paramount’s hostile takeover. Additionally, Paramount could return with a better offer – something its CEO, David Ellison, sneakily teased in leaked texts to WBD CEO David Zaslav, in which he highlighted that the bid did not include the words “best and final.” If it does, a bidding war will almost certainly materialize. What if we told you your TV was watching what you watched and using that information to build a profile and then deliver marketing and other details and offers based on that? That, among other things, is the contention of the Texas Attorney General, who is now suing the largest TV manufacturers, including Samsung, TCL, Hisense, LG, and Sony. And spoiler alert: we found the Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) setting in one of our LG TVs (no one knows if it was on by default or not), and we can show you how to turn it off. Samsung stunned us earlier this year with a 115-inch Micro RGB TV that seriously impressed us after a hands-on. However, at that size and a hefty price tag, it wasn't for most consumers. That's set to change next year, though. In the lead-up to CES 2026, Samsung has confirmed it will expand its Micro RGB line to include more sizes, including smaller models such as 55-inch and 65-inch, all of which still feature micro RGB technology for brighter, more immersive colors and a more compelling viewing experience. Samsung isn't sharing pricing yet, but the hope is that bringing Micro RGB TV tech to more sizes will expand the price points beyond a single option. Time will tell. The OnePlus 15 might have only debuted in October, but OnePlus is back with the 15R – a device that costs less but boasts impressive specs, including a 7,400mAh battery that is larger than the one in the 15 proper. Other highlights of the OnePlus 15R include its 6.83-inch AMOLED display, 32MP front-facing camera, 50MP primary camera, and 12GB of RAM. Though it does come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset and an 8MP ultra-wide snapper. So the 15R doesn’t quite compete with the OnePlus 15, but at a cost of just $699.99 / £649 it doesn’t need to. OnePlus isn't officially available in Australia. In a move which feels as expected as it is disappointing, Meta revealed this week that it has “paused” its third-party VR headset development program – meaning the announced Asus and Lenovo HorizonOS headsets won’t see the light of day. At least not running Meta’s operating system. Announced over a year and a half ago, this writing was arguably on the wall when neither device manifested at Meta Connect 2025. Meta has pledged to “Focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market.” Though our resident XR expert can’t help but wonder if this Meta might have cemented Android XR as the Android of XR instead of Horizon OS.

Happy Friday once again, everyone! The post-Winter Meetings period has seen an absolute flurry of deals added to the Matrix, so I won’t give my esteemed editor too long of an intro to tackle before we get to the past week’s signings, though I did want to share a quick programming note: Matrix Reloaded will be off next week, but as a gift to you, the reader, it will be back the following Monday (December 29) and Friday (January 2) to cover everything that happens in the interim. And since this is the last Reloaded before the holiday, allow me to wish a very merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate! (I will be celebrating a very Jewish Christmas by watching football and eating sushi.) Now without further ado, here’s what happened around the league in the last seven days. Effect on the Padres King’s walk year can’t have been what he wanted, marked as it was by a couple of IL trips and his worst FIP since a 26.2-inning showing in 2020. But he still struck out about a quarter of the batters he faced and is just a year removed from a breakout 2024. As of now, he’ll join Nick Pivetta, who had a breakout of his own this year, to form what could be an excellent top two. The duo will be followed by Joe Musgrove (coming off Tommy John surgery) and a still-questionable amalgam of back-end options like Randy Vásquez, JP Sears, Kyle Hart, and Matt Waldron. Effect on Other Teams King was intriguing to teams because of the smaller commitment he seemed likely to command relative to other arms with top-of-the-rotation potential, like Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, and Tatsuya Imai, and to that end King had widespread appeal. Teams close to his native Massachusetts were reportedly some of the clubs with the greatest interest, with King equally interested in heading back East after starting his career with the Yankees. Perhaps complicating matters, however, was that King was tethered to the qualifying offer, making a contract structure similar to San Diego’s deal (an opt out after each year) potentially tough for anyone but the incumbent Padres to swing; teams may not have wanted to give up a draft pick to sign King to what’s effectively a one-year deal with protections. Those teams may have to bite the bullet and pay more to secure a starter for a longer term. Effect on Similar Players I’m not expecting any remaining starting pitchers to sign a deal similar to King’s, so if there’s any effect on the other starting pitchers on the market, it’ll simply be to get the market moving. Effect on the Diamondbacks With Zac Gallen having hit free agency and Corbin Burnes set to miss a large chunk of the 2026 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery, starting pitching was the direst of needs for a Diamondbacks club that is in something of a transition period, but isn’t necessarily taking a step back, either. Michael Soroka was the first addition to the rotation, and while he certainly helps, he hasn’t thrown even 100 innings in a season since his rookie campaign in 2019. By bringing Kelly back to lead the staff, the Diamondbacks get a known quantity who’s been a rock-solid metronome ever since coming back to the States from Korea, topping 150 innings in four of the last five seasons and posting more than 3 WAR in three of the last four. Behind him will be Ryne Nelson, Eduardo Rodriguez, Brandon Pfaadt, and Soroka. Effect on Other Teams There wasn’t anything out there on which other teams were in on Kelly, but we do know that he had a larger guarantee on the table from a West Coast team (likely California). While Kelly can make his Diamondbacks contract worth $54 million via a vesting option, he left money on the table to return to where he’s comfortable. That other team — whoever it was — still has money to spend on the rotation, though. Effect on Similar Players The “deserving of a multi-year deal in his late 30s” crop is a small one this offseason, with Chris Bassitt really the only pitcher who’s comparable to Kelly. Bassitt hasn’t been quite as good as Kelly has in recent years, but he’s not far off, and he’s also made 25-plus starts in the last six non-2020 seasons, something that Kelly can’t claim. An identical deal to Kelly’s doesn’t seem far-fetched for the 36-year-old. Effect on the Mets The Mets moved on quickly after Pete Alonso defected to Baltimore, with the Polanco deal reported just three days after Alonso’s signing broke. The big wrinkle with Polanco is that he’ll be playing first base for the first time in his major league career, save for one game (indeed, one pitch, as Jay noted in his write-up) this year. While Mets president David Stearns left the door open for Polanco to fill in elsewhere (likely second or third) as needed, the current plan appears to be having Polanco and Mark Vientos split time at first base and DH, with the better defensive player in Brett Baty across the diamond at third and newly-acquired Marcus Semien at second. In Polanco, the Mets are getting a guy who just posted the best-ever year-to-year improvement in his strikeout rate while also setting a career best in wRC+ and clubbing 26 homers playing half his games in a park that isn’t very conducive to the long ball. It’s not totally unrealistic to expect that there’s another gear for Polanco even as he enters his age-32 season, something like his 2021 power output and health in tandem with a command of the strike zone that’s never been stronger. Effect on Other Teams The Mariners were the runners-up for Polanco, falling short of meeting the Mets’ contract with a two-year offer of their own. While there are still free agent options out there for both second and third base, it’s already been reported that Jerry Dipoto would rather be his usual Trader Jerry self to fill those needs. Per The Seattle Times, the Mariners have expressed interest in Ketel Marte and Brendan Donovan, either of whom could hit in the top two spots of the lineup and lengthen a starting nine that looks unimpressive right around the fifth or sixth spot in the order. Effect on Similar Players There are no remaining infielders who are analogous to Polanco — Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette will sign for far more, and Kazuma Okamoto and Munetaka Murakami are coming over from Japan — but since he’s signed to play first base, it may affect how much other first basemen sign for. Ryan O’Hearn is probably the closest first baseman there is to Polanco on the open market, and while he’s still not going to sniff $20 million per year, three-quarters of Polanco’s deal sounds about right. Effect on the Giants Houser revitalized his career on the South Side of Chicago before being traded to the Rays at the deadline, and now cashes in with a nice multi-year deal. He currently slots into the middle of the rotation behind Logan Webb and Robbie Ray, but he may yet move down to the fourth or fifth spot, with the Giants still looking into rotation upgrades despite having Houser in the fold. Effect on Other Teams Judging by the contract value, Houser was viewed as a tier-plus down from the likes of Kelly and Bassitt, which would have made him more affordable to teams on a budget. Those teams still have options aplenty, though, arms who should be similar in cost to Houser but actually come with longer track records. Effect on Similar Players Some of the pitchers for whom a deal akin to Houser’s feels about right include Nick Martinez and Zack Littell, both of whom, like Houser, pitched a fully healthy, perfectly solid 2025. Those two don’t come with the interesting velocity jump that Houser exhibited, but unlike Houser, they have strung together consecutive years of being valuable. Effect on the Braves Kim’s return to the fold now solidifies Atlanta’s starting 10 or 11, with Mike Yastrzemski and Sean Murphy effectively in a platoon that’ll shift some positions around, and Mauricio Dubón perhaps patrolling center field against lefties. In securing the best defensive shortstop on the free agent market (not a high bar considering how shallow the shortstop class is), the Braves now have a very solid defense all around the diamond. Offensively, Kim has been scattershot in his MLB career thus far, but he’s not going to be expected to anchor the lineup in the slightest and will most likely hit eighth or ninth. Effect on Other Teams The most interesting piece of news following Kim’s signing was the report that the A’s offered him four years and $48 million, with the idea that he’d start at second base and occasionally spell shortstop Jacob Wilson. What, if anything, the A’s plan to do with that $48 million (or, viewed another way, $12 million for 2026) remains to be seen, but it piqued my interest to see them go in on another hitter instead of a starting pitcher, at least as far as we know publicly. Perhaps the A’s are just waiting to see which pitcher loses the game of Starting Pitcher Musical Chairs and has to settle for calling a minor league park home. Effect on Similar Players With such a thin shortstop market, there’s nobody like Kim who’s unsigned. Bichette is a shortstop now, but perhaps won’t be for long, and he’ll of course sign for considerably more money. Beyond Bichette, the best available true shortstop is… Isiah Kiner-Falefa? Effect on the Rangers The Rangers had an obvious need for a second catcher after non-tendering Jonah Heim, which left the 35-year-old Kyle Higashioka as the starter for a few weeks. Higgy has never started more than 77 games behind the plate in the season, and unless the Rangers wanted to get a good long look at Willie MacIver, bringing in someone like Jansen was necessary. Jansen himself has never started more than 82 games at catcher, but that high-water mark was set this year, and he probably would have caught 100-plus games had he stuck around with the Rays all season instead of serving as William Contreras’ backup after the trade deadline. The Rangers will likely operate with a timeshare once again, similar to the Heim–Higashioka tandem where neither was ever declared the starter. Effect on Other Teams In an already-thin free agent pool for catchers, teams in search of a backstop now have one fewer option. The Phillies are expected to bring J.T. Realmuto back to the City of Brotherly Love, which would leave Heim, Victor Caratini, and Elias Díaz as the only remaining free agents at the position who’ve had a starter’s(ish) workload in recent years. A lot of the teams above the Phillies in projected catcher performance are probably rolling with what they’ve got anyway, but the Rays and Rockies strike me as clubs looking to upgrade with a starter or oft-playing backup. Effect on Similar Players Of the above-listed catchers, Caratini is the most analogous to Jansen, having always been in a “backup-plus” role without ever fully taking the reins behind the dish. Jansen earning a two-year deal should be good news for Caratini, since Jansen’s median contract prediction (on the Total Spending Projection tab) was for one year at $8.5 million. Caratini ought to do better than the two-year, $12 million contract he just finished and may well outdo Jansen’s deal. Effect on the Padres Song will serve as an indirect Luis Arraez replacement, a lower-cost but higher-risk option to presumably start at second base and slide Jake Cronenworth back over to first. Song took an interesting path to MLB, struggling from ages 18-26 in the KBO before exploding with a 143 wRC+ in 2024 and backing it up with a 151 mark in 2025. He can also fill in for Manny Machado at third and has some first base experience, but none since 2024. Effect on Other Teams We don’t know who else was interested in Song, so it isn’t clear to what extent other teams will have to move on to a plan B. Effect on Similar Players As a first time MLBer coming over from the KBO without huge fanfare, there aren’t any players who are particularly similar to Song, either. Effect on the Cardinals After trading Sonny Gray to Boston, the Cardinals backfilled his spot with May, who simultaneously had his best and worst season at the big league level, depending on how you look at it. The gangly righty finally (almost) made it through a full season without getting hurt, setting a career high in innings with 132.1, over 80 innings more than he’d ever thrown in a big league season before. His performance left quite a bit to be desired, though. May has never struck out a lower proportion of batters or allowed more hard contact than he did this year, and for that reason the Cardinals should get to work with him as soon as possible to figure out what tweaks need to be made to make him better. May will join Matthew Liberatore as the only two Cardinals with a guaranteed rotation spot, with a slew of others — most prominently Andre Pallante, Michael McGreevy, Kyle Leahy, and Richard Fitts — competing for the last three spots. Effect on Other Teams As a young free agent set to pitch in his age-28 season but also coming off a tough year, May offered a unique combination of upside and relative affordability that doesn’t really exist elsewhere on the free agent market. Because of that, there’s no clean pivot for other teams to make, but there are plenty of starters yet to be signed. Effect on Similar Players While there’s nobody quite like May left in free agency, his $12.5 million salary should help inform the price for bounce-back, sign-and-maybe-flip-at-the-trade-deadline starters. Names in that group include Germán Márquez, Walker Buehler, and Aaron Civale, all of whom could probably be signed for less than May. In this section, I’ll go over how each team’s reliever signing(s) affect their projected bullpen, then talk about the best remaining free agent relievers at the end. On the heels of his finest season since 2021, not to mention his busiest, Rogers earned himself the fourth-biggest reliever contract of the offseason to this point. With the lowest release angle in the majors, Rogers will allow the Jays to massively change the eye levels of hitters, especially on the days Trey Yesavage — who has the league’s highest release angle — starts. While Jeff Hoffman was much maligned this year, giving up 15 homers in the regular season and another, uh, gigantic one in the World Series, I wouldn’t anticipate Rogers wresting the closing job from him, assuming Hoffman’s stuff remains intact. Rogers is excellent at inducing soft contact, which should work especially well with Ernie Clement and Andrés Giménez on the infield, but striking batters out is not and never will be part of his game. That makes him far from ideal as the last line of defense, since introducing so many balls in play into the equation can make it harder to get out of jams with tight leads or tie games still intact. Rogers also has a vesting option for $11 million if he pitches 60 games in 2028, or 110 combined from 2027 to 2028 and then passes a physical at the end of the 2028 season. Considering his workhorse nature, that seems about as close to a guarantee as a vesting option can get. Formerly a Rule 5 success as a starting pitcher after he was taken by the Royals out of the Diamondbacks system in 2017, Keller’s career fell on hard times beginning in 2021. From that year through 2024, bouncing between the rotation and the bullpen, Keller posted a garish 5.18 ERA and 4.90 FIP with the Royals, White Sox, and Red Sox. That all changed this year, when Keller took a minor league deal with the Cubs and came into spring training throwing harder than ever. But he didn’t just blow it by guys: He used a five-pitch, starter-like repertoire to retire hitters in any situation Craig Counsell asked, saving three games, opening one, and allowing only four homers in 69.2 innings. While he had interest from other teams (including the Tigers) as a starter, Keller will stay in the bullpen for the Phillies, serving as Jhoan Duran’s top righty setup man. Just an hour or so after the Keller signing was reported, news broke that the Mets had agreed to an identical deal with Weaver, reuniting him with Yankees teammate Devin Williams to form a 1-2 punch at the back of the bullpen. Weaver’s 2025 was a step back from his 2024, with a hamstring strain and possible pitch-tipping putting a damper on a season that had started excellently; by the time October rolled around, he was persona non grata in high-leverage situations. For the Mets to have still given Weaver a sizable commitment suggests that they believe that any mechanical or tipping issues can be ironed out, if they haven’t been already. As the depth chart currently stands, the Mets will have lefties A.J. Minter and Brooks Raley and righty Huascar Brazobán to help get to Weaver and Williams in the eighth and ninth. Adbert Alzolay, signed to a two-year minor league deal last offseason, could be an X factor in the middle innings. After a season in Anaheim, Jansen heads to Detroit to take on a role he’s never had: non-closer. Well, sorta. Even with Jansen just 24 saves away from 500, he’s not being handed the closer’s job and has indicated he is on board with how A.J. Hinch likes to operate a bullpen, picking spots for his best arms instead of setting rigid roles. That means Jansen will be competing with Will Vest and Kyle Finnegan for saves. Despite great run-prevention numbers as an Angel, it wasn’t an unimpeachably good season for the 38-year-old. His strikeout rate and CSW% were the lowest of his career, and Jansen benefitted from a career-low .195 BABIP allowed. But his cutter velocity was right in line with 2024, and he was stingier than he had been in recent years at issuing walks, so he gives Hinch a solid closing option, even if he’s not the closer. After a career high in WAR, appearances, and innings pitched in his only season with the Rangers, Armstrong’s circuitous, up-and-down career will return to where it all began. The 35-year-old’s four-pitch mix — he uses all four pitches just about equally — is unique for a reliever and gives the Guardians a different look from closer Cade Smith, setup man Hunter Gaddis and lefty Erik Sabrowski, all of whom are more traditional two- or three-pitch bullpen arms. Thielbar returns to Wrigley Field after posting one of the finest seasons of his career at age 38. Of the Cubs’ key bullpenners to hit free agency, he is the only one who has re-signed with the club. The new-look relief corps will be led by the flame-throwing Daniel Palencia, with Thielbar joining new additions Phil Maton and Hoby Milner in helping to set him up with a variety of looks. Ferguson was extremely reliable for both the Pirates and Mariners in 2025, allowing just two homers in 65.1 innings thanks to a hard-hit rate that dropped nearly 10 percentage points year over year. With Brent Suter reaching free agency, the Reds had a clear need for lefty relief and found it in Ferguson. Along with Tony Santillan, Graham Ashcraft, and Connor Phillips, he’ll help bridge the gap between the day’s starter and closer Emilio Pagán. The yearly Angels Bullpen Makeover has found two interesting names in Pomeranz and Romano, who headed in opposite directions this season. Pomeranz made his way back to the majors for the first time since 2021 after having been ravaged by injuries and pitched excellently for the Cubs, while Romano had a stinker of a season for the Phillies. The closer competition will be intriguing to watch come spring training, with Robert Stephenson, Brock Burke, and Ryan Zeferjahn competing for leverage innings with Pomeranz and Romano. Ben Joyce, the 105-mph man, had shoulder surgery this year but could be a factor at some point in 2026. Foley’s a longer-term upside play for the Giants, as he’s under club control through 2028 and won’t be ready to join the big league team until midseason after undergoing a shoulder procedure earlier this year. At his best, he’s a groundball machine who can rush his sinker to the plate at close to triple digits. Lefty Robert Garcia was the only high-leverage holdover from a Rangers bullpen that saw Martin hit free agency along with Phil Maton, Shawn Armstrong, Hoby Milner, and Danny Coulombe. Jacob Webb and Josh Sborz were later non-tendered, giving Texas essentially an entire bullpen to reconstruct. Díaz and Alexander are lower-cost signings who could nonetheless provide important innings, especially if Díaz can get within shouting distance of his peak with the Reds. Alexander was quietly very good after latching on with the White Sox at midseason, and at minimum will be helpful at eating innings. Martin battled multiple injuries last year but was basically himself during his age-39 season. He was extremely stingy at issuing free passes, making him a low heart rate option for new manager Skip Schumaker. He could compete with Garcia for the closer job should the Rangers elect to use just one man in that role. Best-of-the-Rest Relievers While the cupboard has gotten significantly more bare in the past week, there are still relievers aplenty looking for jobs. Pete Fairbanks is the one relief arm left with significant closing experience, and he ought to get a deal similar to those signed by Keller and Weaver. But there are other hard-throwing relievers from the right side, like Seranthony Domínguez and Michael Kopech. Fellow righties Jakob Junis, Luis García, Pierce Johnson, Tyler Kinley, and Scott Barlow are also coming off good seasons. Elsewhere, Tommy Kahnle and Hunter Harvey are interesting buy-lows. The options from the left side aren’t quite as exciting, but Sean Newcomb, Brent Suter, Danny Coulombe, Kolby Allard, Andrew Chafin, Taylor Rogers, and Jalen Beeks are all looking for jobs. García has been worse than the man he’s replacing, Nick Castellanos, the last couple seasons, but only at the plate. He’s a massive upgrade is in the field; he’s almost always been average or above with a cannon of an arm in right. Of course, the Phillies are hoping to get more out of the bat. Maybe he’ll never again reach the heights of his 2023 season, in which he posted a 128 wRC+, but his 2022 (112) or even 2021 (99) would be more than welcome. As for Castellanos, the Phillies are now tasked with finding a taker for at least some small portion of the $20 million that remains on his contract. There haven’t been any teams connected to him yet, and the Phillies may have to wait for the dust to settle on the remaining free agent hitters before working out a deal. Bell’s journeyman ways continue, as he’s joining his sixth team since being traded away from the Pirates after the 2020 season. With the Twins planning to keep Byron Buxton, Pablo López, and Joe Ryan, first base became one of the big needs for the club to fill as they look to at least somewhat contend in 2026. Bell’s switch-hitting allows him to start with the platoon advantage every day, but his recent performance against lefties (56 wRC+ this year) leaves a lot to be desired. Griffin revitalized his career pitching for NPB’s Yomiuri Giants over the last three seasons and was able to secure himself an MLB contract after 78 innings of 1.62 ERA ball in 2025. Though MacKenzie Gore (if he’s still around) is the only arm guaranteed to be in the Nationals’ rotation, Griffin should have a leg up in a competition that also includes Cade Cavalli, Josiah Gray, Brad Lord, Jake Irvin, Mitchell Parker, and Griff McGarry, among others. Rosario will return to the niche lefty-mashing role that he filled so well for the Yankees down the stretch, mostly plugging in as a platoon partner for lefty-swinging Ryan McMahon at third base. Rosario’s biggest issue is that he’s an awful fielder no matter where you put him, but he’s at least got experience attempting to play six different positions, which makes him more easily usable as a pinch-hitter late in games, too. Austin returns to MLB after six seasons spent mashing in Japan, hitting as many as 28 homers in a single season for the BayStars and posting a 147 wRC+ in 246 plate appearances this year. He’s a logical platoon partner for Moisés Ballesteros at DH or Michael Busch at first. “Backup catcher to Cal Raleigh” is the closest thing baseball has to “backup quarterback to Tom Brady,” so Knizner won’t play very much. He should still be able to get 100 plate appearances for the first time since 2023, though. Effect on the Pirates The top three needs for the Pirates heading into the offseason? Offense, offense, and offense. Before acquiring Lowe and Mangum, the best Pittsburgh could muster was acquiring outfielder Jhostynxon Garcia from the Red Sox in between missing out on Josh Naylor and Kyle Schwarber. Lowe’s defense at second base has never been anything to write home about, but he’s posted a wRC+ below 110 just once in his big league career and has popped as many as 39 homers in a season. He’s now the best hitter the Pirates have, but he shouldn’t be the last middle-of-the-order threat they acquire. On the Matrix, they’ve been connected to Munetaka Murakami, Kazuma Okamoto, J.T. Realmuto, Ryan O’Hearn, and Marcell Ozuna. From my vantage point, a righty bat would make the most sense, with Lowe joining Oneil Cruz and Spencer Horwitz from the left side. Mangum had a solid rookie showing this year, finally reaching the bigs in his age-29 season. He has virtually no pop and won’t take walks, but he switch-hits, he can play all three outfield positions, and he’ll steal a bunch of bases, too. Montgomery is no slouch himself, with triple-digit heat from the left side and a vicious slider making for as good of a two-pitch mix as any in baseball, at least in terms of pure stuff. Montgomery had some hiccups this year but still struck out over 30% of batters faced. His acquisition gives first-year manager Don Kelly a second hard-throwing lefty to go with the just-signed Gregory Soto. Effect on the Rays Lowe’s been included in trade rumors for years, and the rumors have finally become reality. The Rays have plenty of options for replacing him, including sliding Taylor Walls over to second and giving top prospect Carson Williams the reins at shortstop, or alternatively giving Richie Palacios the starting job. Of course, the Rays could go even bigger here: On the Trades/Claims tab of the Matrix, you’ll see that they reportedly have interest in Ketel Marte. Melton is another lefty-hitting outfielder for an organization that already has plenty, so he comes to mind as someone who could plausibly be flipped to Arizona in a hypothetical Marte trade. As for Brito, it’s not hard to see why he piqued the Rays’ interest: He’s a hard-thrower who strikes a bunch of guys out. Effect on the Astros The Astros rotation entering the offseason was Hunter Brown and a Bunch of Frowns, and Burrows is a good arm with six years remaining before he hits free agency. His changeup is his calling card, but he also throws in the mid-90s with a slider that grades out pretty well by Stuff+. Even if he’s basically the same as he was this year (3.94 ERA, 4.00 FIP, 4.35 xERA), he’s an upgrade for a rotation with no sure things beyond Brown. We’ll have more on the trade up at the site soon. Effect on the Orioles The Orioles boldly traded from their rotation when they moved Grayson Rodriguez to the Angels in exchange for new starting left fielder Taylor Ward, and they had yet to add to a group led by Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish. Enter Baz, who has a scintillating fastball and a filthy curveball but has yet to quite put it all together. What Baz finally did do this year, though, was stay healthy, with a career-high 31 starts and 166.1 innings. Still just 26 years old, Baz has three more years of control remaining before he hits free agency, and I wouldn’t assume his acquisition takes the Orioles out of the market for starting pitching entirely. Adding another starter would likely push Tyler Wells to the bullpen, where he’s succeeded in the past. Effect on the Rays In case you forgot, this is what the Rays do. They get pretty good seasons out of their pitchers, and trade them at or near the height of their value. Having just signed Steven Matz, Baz became more expendable, and the Rays are (hopefully) getting Shane McClanahan back into the rotation and can use Joe Boyle, Joe Rock, and Ian Seymour as depth options as well. The haul for Baz — two of the club’s top four picks last year in Slater de Brun and Caden Bodine, plus righty starter Michael Forret and speedy outfielder Austin Overn, not to mention the comp pick — stocks up a Rays organization that’s always churning through prospects and taking long-term 40-man roster considerations into account. And if the team is in fact interested in Marte after moving Lowe to Pittsburgh, they’ve got all the more ammo now. We’ll have more on the trade up at the site soon. Effect on the Royals The Royals entered the offseason with perhaps the bleakest outfield situation amongst contending teams, and while signing Lane Thomas was a nice first step, it certainly couldn’t have been the last one. Enter Collins, a former Triple-A Rule 5 pick who finished fourth in NL Rookie of the Year voting thanks to a 122 wRC+ and a 13% walk rate. He’s also versatile in all facets since he switch-hits and has minor league experience at second and third in addition to the outfield. We’ve currently got him projected as the no. 8 hitter at RosterResource, but he’s got a leadoff skill set if Maikel Garcia continues to hit for power and Matt Quatraro wants to bump him down. As for Mears, he now joins his fourth major league team in four years of service time. He throws hard and has shown big strikeout stuff in the past, but took a step back in that department this year, which was also his busiest at the big league level. On the plus side, his walk rate was also a career best by far. He’ll serve in middle relief behind closer Carlos Estévez and setup men Lucas Erceg, John Schreiber, and the newly-acquired Matt Strahm (covered below). Effect on the Brewers On its surface, five years of club control for Collins and two of Mears looks like an awful lot to give up for Zerpa, who’s never quite put it all together and hasn’t been beloved by ERA estimators, either. But the Brewers have gotten so much out of so many different types of pitchers for so many years that it wouldn’t be at all surprising to see a major glow-up from Zerpa, perhaps even as a starter. If he is indeed in the bullpen to start things out next year, he’s probably the fourth-best lefty option as it currently stands, but he could — as so many Brewers have — quickly shoot upward into greater prominence. As for the outfield sans Collins, the Brewers still have five starting-caliber options with Christian Yelich set to continue as the primary DH: Jake Bauers, Sal Frelick, Jackson Chourio, Blake Perkins, and Garrett Mitchell. All but Bauers can play center, and Perkins is a switch-hitter, so there are many combinations the Brewers can put out there. Effect on the Royals Reacquiring Strahm, who started his career with Kansas City, is something of an extension of the Collins–Zerpa trade, with the Royals backfilling Zerpa’s spot by bringing in a pitcher with whom they’re familiar and who has recently outpitched Zerpa. Strahm’s gotten more fly ball-heavy in recent years, which should play better in Kansas City’s cavernous outfield than it did in Philadelphia, and while his walk rate has fluctuated a bit, it’s consistently better than league average. He’ll be the unquestioned top lefty in the Royals bullpen, helping to get to Estévez in the ninth. Effect on the Phillies Initial reactions to the trade from Phillies fans (yes, I spend way too much time on Twitter and Bluesky) were negative, because Strahm has been such a key part of the Phillies’ staff over the last three years. But in Bowlan the Phillies are acquiring six years of a very interesting relief arm who came into his own once moving to the bullpen in 2025. Bowlan’s fastball and slider whiff rates were both around 40% this year, and he continued to mix in a sinker, curve, and changeup, making it easy enough to see him transitioning back to starting at some point down the line if his stuff can hold in that role. We’ll have more on the trade up at the site soon. Jon Becker manages RosterResource's team payroll pages and assists with all other aspects of RosterResource, too. Follow him at your own peril on Twitter at @jonbecker_ and on BlueSky at @jon-becker.com. Good stuff but Semien not McNeil is the starting second baseman. I would say at this time McNeil is the starting LFer though things can and will change. Good catch, thanks David! That’s been fixed.

Title: A major overhaul of League of Legends is reportedly coming in 2027: 'Once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League'

Riot has big plans for attracting new players to its aging MOBA. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A new Bloomberg report says Riot Games is currently working on an update to League of Legends, known internally as League Next, that will be the biggest in the game's history. The overhaul of League's "visual aesthetic," as Bloomberg put it, will impact characters, battle arenas, and the interface, and is aimed at making the game more welcoming for new players. League of Legends has a reputation for being rough on newcomers, which is probably inevitable for a game that's been around for 16 years. To put that in perspective, you could've started playing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit and still be 10 years behind the real veterans. That's a big hump to overcome, but Riot needs to surmount it: LoL is still one of the biggest and most successful videogames on the planet (the 2025 Worlds had a base prize pool of $5 million) but the existing player base is getting older and there aren't a lot of newbies jumping in. The continued success of League is vital to Riot, because it's struggled on other fronts: In early 2024 it laid off 530 employees and closed Riot Forge, the initiative it launched in 2019 to make singleplayer League of Legends games in partnership with external studios. The games that emerged from that program, including Ruined King, Mageseeker, Bandle Tale, Song of Nunu, and Convergence, were generally well received but failed to attract significant audiences. Another round of layoffs at Riot followed in October, as Riot co-founder Marc Merrill indicated that the studio was looking back to its foundational MOBA for future success. "This isn't about reducing headcount to save money," Merrill said at the time. "It's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond. While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League." After the Bloomberg report went out, Riot posted a video that didn't exactly deny what was in it. Pointedly entitled "A look at some of our plans for League after 2026," the video has executive producer Paul "Pabro" Bellezza and head of studio Andrei "Meddler" van Roon acknowledging that the studio has "been working on some bigger updates to League." A look at some of our plans for League after 2026. pic.twitter.com/vqsnBksg1YDecember 18, 2025 "For starters, we're making a brand-new around-game client that's fully integrated with the in-game experience, rather than being a separate application like today," van Roon says. Bellezza then jumps in to say, "We're also revamping Summoner's Rift with entirely new visuals, and a bit of new gameplay," and then adds, pointedly, that Riot is "overhauling the new player experience, so that once we're done, it should be the best time ever to get your friends into League." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It definitely isn't a comprehensive look at what's coming in some post-2026 timeframe, but it does sound very much like it will be very big indeed. Whether it succeeds in attracting new players to League, or merely annoys the existing old-timers, is an entirely separate question, and the irony is that Riot's co-domination of the MOBA space, alongside Valve's Dota 2, has made life extremely difficult for newcomers. Supervive, developed by a team of Riot veterans and released just five months ago, announced earlier this week that it will close down in February; Seekers of Skyveil had an even shorter lifespan, Gigantic: Rampage Edition has literally zero players on Steam, and Amazon recently opted to sell March of Giants to Ubisoft rather than release it. League of Legends may be aging out, but whether there's an appetite for some kind of 'League 2.0' remains to be seen. 2026 games: All the upcoming gamesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted December 19, 2025 by Ben Carlson These are the recent maximum drawdowns for a handful of giant technology stocks: Sans Netflix, these are some of the biggest names in the AI trade. This is what everyone has been worrying about for quite some time now. What happens when the AI trade unwinds? These companies are worth a combined ~$9 trillion in market cap. Surely the stock market is falling right? No (and don’t call me Shirley). The S&P 500 is within spitting distance of new all-time highs: The equal-weighted S&P 500 hit new all-time highs this week: So did the Russell 2000 Index of small cap stocks: Stock market concentration has been a worry for certain market pundits for years now. Just wait until the tech stocks rollover. The market is going to get crushed! Maybe that will happen someday, but these things are fluid. If tech stocks do falter it’s also possible other parts of the market will fill the void. That’s exactly what’s happening right now. I don’t spend much time worrying about stock market concentration because that’s how the stock market works. The long-term gains tend to be driven by a small handful of winners. I’m more concerned about investors who have allowed their portfolios to become overly concentrated during this epic bull market run. There’s an old saying: you concentrate to get rich, but diversify to stay rich. I’ve certainly seen that play out with many of the wealth management clients we work with at Ritholtz. There are plenty of people who come to us in search of financial advice who struck it rich through business ownership, real estate investing, company stock options or buying and holding a small number of individual stocks over the long haul. In the past 5 years or so the number of people with concentrated stock market gains has grown by leaps and bounds. Here’s a story in The Wall Street Journal about an investor who concentrated his portfolio in tech stocks for the past decade and won: Brian Hahn had most of his savings in tech stocks for a decade. As an escalating artificial-intelligence frenzy this year sent markets to new heights, he sold it all. The 51-year-old math teacher for years had about 80% of his investments in tech, including exchange-traded funds and individual semiconductor companies. In October, he put most of that money into gold, which many see as a haven during big market downturns. “It was too much risk for me to assume that this was going to keep moving higher,” said Hahn. Good for him. He likely made a bunch of money in tech stocks and has now downshifted into gold. Will this shift work? Time will tell. Here’s my concern for investors like this who concentrated their money in a handful of tech names over the past 5-10 years and destroyed most professional money managers in the process — it’s not always going to be this easy. Obviously, saying this was easy is hindsight bias, but all you had to do was buy a handful of the biggest name-brand companies in the world that create products and services used by billions of us every single day. And you made massive returns in the process! Buy-what-you-know is not going to work forever. Dom Cooke wrote an excellent profile at Colossus about Henry Ellenbogen, a former T. Rowe Price portfolio manager who has studied the biggest compounders over the years. This part was interesting: “We never felt money was going to be free forever,” he said. “But we had made some simplifying assumptions after a decade of free money.” Ellenbogen is not reactive. He trades his portfolio as little as possible. But by the beginning of 2022, it became clear this wasn’t a temporary dislocation. The regime had changed. He went back to his study on compounders. In a normal decade, about 40 stocks compound wealth at 20% a year. In the free money era, 120 stocks had achieved it. There were imposters in his portfolio. So three times as many companies compounded at 20% per year than normal. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime cycle for huge compounders. In fact, I would be shocked if we ever saw a situation like this again. The stock market is concentrated at the top but there are still plenty of other stocks that can soften the blow when the biggest names stumble. But if you have an ultra-concentrated portfolio of stocks there is no cushion if things go wrong. Concentration can make you rich, and it has made a lot of people rich in this cycle. But it can also take away those gains or make you poor in a hurry. Diversification is going to matter again at some point. Michael and I talked about stock market concentration, the AI reversal, new all-time highs and more on this week’s Animal Spirits video: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Subscribe to The Compound so you never miss an episode.

December 19, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, today announced it has been awarded a landmark prime contract by the U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 (TRKT3) program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The award is Rocket Lab’s largest single contract to date and underscores its growing reputation as a trusted prime in national security space. Under the $816 million contract, Rocket Lab will deliver satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems. The award includes a $806 million base contract plus up to $10.45 million in options. Each satellite will feature Rocket Lab’s next-generation Phoenix infrared sensor payload, a wide field-of-view (WFOV) solution designed to meet the evolving missile defense needs of national security space. To ensure mission resilience, the satellites will be equipped with Rocket Lab’s advanced StarLite space protection sensors, designed to safeguard the constellation against directed energy threats. Notably, StarLite sensors have also been adopted by other prime contractors developing TRKT3 satellites, further expanding Rocket Lab’s role in the program and unlocking additional contract value beyond its own satellite production. In addition to the $816M prime contract award value, as a leading merchant supplier into the other TRKT3 prime contractors, there are additional subsystem opportunities that could take the total capture value to approximately $1 billion for supplying items such as payloads, solar solutions, attitude determination and control components, software, and other solutions from our broad portfolio of capabilities. Disrupting Traditional Defense Primes with Vertical IntegrationRocket Lab’s satellites will be built on its proven Lightning platform, leveraging the Company’s vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities to deliver an unmatched combination of speed, cost efficiency, and quality. All major components – from solar arrays, reaction wheels and star trackers to propulsion systems, avionics, payloads, and launch dispensers – are designed and produced in-house. This end-to-end approach enables Rocket Lab to rapidly scale production while maintaining control over cost and schedule, a critical advantage in meeting the urgent demands of national security missions. “The Tranche 3 Tracking Layer constellation is part of the U.S. Space Force’s strategy to counter rapidly evolving global threats, ensuring the nation’s defense capabilities remain ahead of adversaries. Rocket Lab is honored to play a role in enabling this,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Peter Beck. “Demand for resilient, scalable, and affordable space systems continues to grow, and this award demonstrates that Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in delivering solutions that meet the needs of national security. As the only commercial provider producing both spacecraft and payloads in-house for the SDA Tracking Layer, Rocket Lab is delivering a truly disruptive solution that combines speed, resilience, and affordability. This contract underscores that Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated approach isn’t just a competitive advantage – we’re enabling a fundamental shift in how national security space programs are executed.” Building on Momentum: $1.3 Billion in SDA Contracts AwardedThis contract builds on Rocket Lab’s existing $515 million award to deliver 18 satellites for SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program, which provides secure, low-latency communications across the PWSA. The more than $1.3 billion in contract value now awarded to Rocket Lab by SDA demonstrates strong confidence in Rocket Lab’s ability to execute on large-scale, high-stakes national security programs. Rocket Lab’s growing role as a prime contractor for the U.S. Space Force highlights its emergence as a formidable competitor to legacy aerospace primes. By combining technology, vertical integration, and a proven track record of delivering results, Rocket Lab is redefining what’s possible in national security space. + Rocket Lab Media Contactmedia@rocketlabusa.com + About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads, and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Title: Facebook users were deceived about privacy. It will cost Meta 0.03% of revenue to settle
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/12/19/facebook-users-deceived-privacy-will-cost-meta-0-03-revenue-settle/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T20:15:00Z
Full Content:
California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Thursday announced a $50 million settlement with Meta Platforms Inc., resolving allegations that the company deceived millions of users about privacy controls and allowed third-party apps to improperly access personal information for years. The settlement, pending approval by a San Francisco Superior Court judge, stems from allegations that Meta misled Facebook users about their ability to limit who could see their personal details, including information that was collected and sold to Cambridge Analytica in a 2013. The practice affected an estimated 7 million Facebook users in California. Under the agreement, Meta will pay $50 million in civil penalties and implement reforms to how it oversees third-party applications on the Facebook platform for the next three years. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. ADVERTISEMENT The settlement amount is a drop in the bucket for the social media behemoth. According to a January 2025 statement (opens in new tab), Meta generated $164.5 billion in revenue for the 2024 fiscal year; the settlement would amount to about 0.03% of that. Earning revenue at the rate of $18.78 million per hour, the company would have needed just under 2 hours and 40 minutes to cover the cost. That’s more than enough time to screen the David Fincher-directed 2010 movie “The Social Network,” plus a generous amount of trailers. Looking at it from another angle, $50 million is equal to 0.17% of the $29.75 billion Meta shelled out to repurchase its Class A common stock that same year. Because “I saw a TikTok” doesn’t always cut it. Dozens of stories, daily. The complaint centered on what Facebook users were told about protections for their personal information versus what Meta allowed third parties to do. Meta told users they could restrict their data to “friends” on Facebook through privacy settings. But the company simultaneously granted millions of third-party apps access to that information through the Facebook App Platform, a tool for app developers that was distinct from the main social media site. According to court documents, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other senior executives knew about privacy risks as early as 2012 but delayed action, possibly to protect the company’s declining stock price. The settlement requires Meta to maintain comprehensive policies governing how third-party developers can access user information, including clear disclosures about what data apps collect and how it is used. Meta must also establish a “robust enforcement program” to monitor app developers’ compliance with its policies. The three-year agreement says Meta must disclose to users what information third-party apps will access before users authorize the apps, and provide an option to withhold authorization. “By settling this matter with no admission of wrongdoing, we’re choosing to focus on the future,” a Meta spokesperson said. “This settlement relates to a years-long dispute about repeatedly debunked allegations regarding old practices that are no longer relevant to how Meta’s products or systems work. We look forward to continuing to build products Californians love and trust.” Meta must also create enable users to review which apps have access to their data, including when apps last accessed information. The settlement stipulates that Meta will periodically review that third parties comply and notify users when there are violations, among other terms. The settlement also requires Meta to submit twice-yearly enforcement reports to its board of directors and make those reports available to the attorney general upon request. An executive must report annually to the board on compliance with the judgment. According to the complaint, Meta made changes to Facebook privacy settings in December 2012 that removed references to third-party apps from the main privacy page and buried app-specific controls where few users would find them. The company also granted certain “whitelisted” apps special access to user data that bypassed privacy settings entirely. The attorney general’s investigation found that despite estimating that hundreds of thousands of apps violated its policies by accessing unnecessary user data, Meta could identify only 63 enforcement actions between 2012 and 2018. The complaint alleges that Meta made at least seven false public statements between 2010 and 2016 claiming it aggressively enforced policies to protect users. In court files, the company stated that it was settling “for the sake of resolution” without admitting facts or legal claims alleged in the complaint. The settlement comes years after the Cambridge Analytica scandal became public in 2018, revealing that the British consulting firm had obtained data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. The information was used for political advertising during the 2016 presidential election. The settlement will remain in effect for three years and must be implemented within 180 days. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce compliance.

Everyone’s betting; nobody’s winning. Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel explores the burgeoning industry of prediction markets. These platforms let people wager on everything from elections and award shows to the most trivial internet ephemera, framing bets as tradable “shares” that rise and fall like stocks. With billions in weekly trading volume, massive new funding rounds, and even a CNN partnership with the prediction-betting platform, Kalshi, prediction markets are quickly moving from niche curiosity to mainstream-media fixture—openly touting ambitions to financialize everything. Warzel is joined by writer Max Read, who argues that prediction markets sit at the intersection of gambling, finance, and a broader “suckerification” economy aimed at young men. Together they unpack whether the markets actually reflect the “wisdom of crowds” or whether they’re little more than a meta-game of vibes, ideology, and misvalued dumb money. The pair explore the culture of these platforms and offer a diagnosis of the attention economy: When it’s hard to sell anything directly, it’s easier to sell derivatives of everything. Prediction markets may promise clarity, Warzel and Read suggest, but what they really offer is another way to feel excitement in a world that feels rigged. The following is a transcript of the episode: Max Read: When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money, though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of both commercial and political kind of apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money. Charlie Warzel: I am Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. A few weeks ago on this podcast, the journalist Pablo Torre told me this. Pablo Torre: It feels like, you know, we’re living at a time in which lots of young people were promised things they were not delivered. Perhaps because of the generations that continued to wield power in our government, economy, et cetera, the Boomers—and the way to, like, Chutes and Ladders your way to the American dream is gambling on shit. And in that casino premise, I think you just see again a through line across all these sectors of American life now. Sports being one that has so naturally taken to it. Because, my gosh, here’s an unlimited menu. I mean, literally. Warzel: Today we’re going to explore another part of that unlimited menu of gambling in the casino-ification of the American economy: prediction markets. Chances are you’ve been hearing a lot about prediction markets lately. At their core, prediction markets are online spaces where people can place wagers on the outcome of events. They share similarities with sports books except, unlike a traditional bed at a casino, your wager is a futures contract—the value of which fluctuates based on the market value of the outcome of any given event. Right now, people use the markets to bet on sports, events like the Oscars, whether Elon Musk will tweet a specific number of times in a given month, or about the outcome of an election. The top platforms now for prediction markets collectively report several billion dollars’ worth of weekly trading volume. Kalshi, one of the biggest prediction markets in this space, announced this month that it raised a billion dollars from many of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture-capital firms. Recently, CNN announced it was partnering with Kalshi to integrate the company’s prediction-market data in the news coverage. The company’s CEO, Tarek Mansour, has big ambitions. At a conference in October, he said this about Kalshi’s future: Tarek Mansour: The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion. Warzel: “Financialize everything.” That’s essentially the quiet part out loud. That is the blueprint for the actual casinoification of the world, brought to you by one of the more ascendant companies that’s moving everything toward gambling. So what’s really going on here? How do prediction markets work? Is there some truth to what boosters allege: that people putting their money where their mouths are is actually a good way to tap into the wisdom of crowds? Or is this just a dystopian development? An example of companies preying on a society with a burgeoning gambling addiction? Today I am joined by Max Read, author of the Great Substack Read Max. Read covers culture and power on the internet and has this really intuitive understanding of platforms and people. Recently he wrote a great piece titled “Prediction Markets and the Suckerification Crisis.” Max and I talk about where all this is going and why everyone is gambling and no one is happy. Now, my conversation with Max Read. Warzel: Max Read, welcome to Galaxy Brain. Read: Thanks for having me, Charlie. Warzel: Yeah. So we’re going to talk about prediction markets. Hopefully come up with some grand theory as to why they are ascendant and why everything feels a little bit broken. But I want to just first—for the normies out there who aren’t, you know, using them. How would you describe them? How are they different from straight-up gambling or a sports book? Read: Yeah, well, the first time I wrote about them, I described them as sports books that allowed you to place wagers on non-sports events. But I think the extra sort of bit that’s important to understand about them—because at the end of the day, that is what they are, and it’s the way a lot of people use them. And I should note, by the way, that when I say they’re not: They’re sports books that allow you to place bets on non-sporting events. Many of them are actually also sports books. Kalshi in particular allows you to place wagers on games. But what they do is really emphasize the wager as a security that you can purchase and sell the way you would a share on the stock market, say. So if you believed, say, that there would be a Democratic sweep across New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City back in November, you could have bought shares. Or you could have bet on that outcome for, you know, what, like 30—like, they’ll do it as prices, right? You bet, you wager 30 cents for the return of a dollar, right? So you could buy the shares at 30 cents. You buy 10 shares at 30 cents; you get $10 back. If that comes off. Now, I mentioned 30 cents, say, because a couple weeks—I’m not sure if that’s the exact price—but a couple weeks before this election, it was kind of unclear what Democrats’ chances were going to be in any of these elections. There’s a lot of polls coming out saying that Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey was running dangerously sort of close in the race against … I can’t even remember the name of her opponent at this point. But, you know, it was a fairly low probability according to the betters on the app. Right? But as the returns start to come in on Tuesday night—and it becomes clear that actually the chances that this is going to be a sweep across all these elections get higher—all of a sudden the price of a given wager rises. Or the price of a given share, so to speak. So at 30 cents—suddenly it’s 40 cents, suddenly it’s 60 cents. The way you would think about that if you were just talking gambling odds is, all of a sudden, you’re getting less return on your wager, basically. Your odds are getting significantly easier. And, you could have, say—let me give a slightly different example of election. So recently in Tennessee, this woman, Aftyn Behn, was running for a congressional seat. And, she was absolutely not the favorite. It was a “Trump plus 30” congressional district or whatever, and you could buy shares for her victory at like, you know, 20 cents, something like that, the week before the election. The night of the election, as returns start coming in, she’s looking actually kind of good for it. The early returns are quite good for her. And I watched as the price of her shares climbed up. I’m not going to say whether or not I had any horse in this race, any money on this. But I was watching it closely, let’s just say. And there was a point where if you had bought shares at 30—and again, who knows who I’m talking about here—but if you had bought shares at 30, you could have sold them for a 100 percent profit. Sold them at 60 cents. Only for those shares to come crashing down as the results continue coming over the night, and it becomes clear it’s not happening. So—sorry, this is a sort of complicated explanation—but I think it’s useful to understand how you use it. Right? That when you go on these sites, what you’re doing is: You’re doing this kind of thing that’s kind of a hybrid. Like stock-market day-trading activity and a betting activity. And I do think it’s worth saying, as much as they emphasize the sort of security, quality of these wagers. You can do this at a sports book too, right? That odds will change at a sports book depending on who’s taking which side of the bet, and you can cash out. Most sports books will allow you to cash out various times, you know, after you’ve placed your wager. And if the odds of the wager have changed in between the period where you placed your wager and you’re cashing out, you could make a small profit just from cashing out, right? If you wager a team is going to win, and then you could cash out with five minutes to go and they’re up by 20 points, you’re not going to get as much as you would if you saw the whole thing out. But you can cash out at a fairly high profit. So in that sense, you know, it’s sort of another way of looking at, or another way of thinking about, gambling that emphasizes the sort of up-and-down nature of odds. And I think that’s how most people kind of approach it when they’re on the site placing these wagers—they’re thinking about it like betting. But I think it’s also important to understand why [these sites] have become so ubiquitous in media is that they are exciting to a lot of economists and libertarians. especially libertarian economists. It’s that they offer a kind of semi-accurate—accurate depending on the liquidity of the market, accurate depending on the size of the market—accurate picture of what you might think of as the conventional wisdom. Right? Because there’s all these people collectively saying how much [they’re] placing their own odds, so to speak, on a given outcome. Wagering their own actual money, so they have skin in the game. So nobody’s doing this just for propaganda purposes, or whatever. You can say, Conventional wisdom has the chances of this event happening at 50 percent, 30 percent, whatever. Now, these markets are still fairly small, and many of them are not very liquid at all. So it is not like there’s millions of people betting a couple bucks at a time to make them, you know, as sort of accurate as possible. You’ll have a couple whales who are placing large wagers, which makes them interesting in what they tell you. Because it’s not saying, necessarily, the conventional wisdom according to the kind of person who places a bet on this kind of a thing. But that’s the other side of it. The nonuser side, the media side, the philosophical side of this is: Prediction markets allow us to start to look at the future in this way that allows us to set probabilities about things. Warzel: I’m curious what you make of the “wisdom of crowds” bit, because this is the part of me that stops and feels a little insane sometimes with this. Because I think about, like, this is essentially a meta-game, right? Where you have this system that produces outcomes and incentives for certain outcomes that arise in it, and you wrap that system in an apparatus that is also concerned with influencing those outcomes. It’s this second-order thing like you have with poker—where good poker players can technically predict the outcome of hands, but that is also influencing the outcomes of the games. It just feels to me like what you’re doing is: Prediction markets aren’t what people think will happen. It’s what people think other people think will happen, right? So it feels to me it’s confusing. Read: I do think there’s a use for that. You could come up with reasons. And from a financial sort of market perspective, one way of thinking about it is that these are effectively tools. Instruments for hedging, right? That you have a sense of—you think something’s going to happen, but you also want to place some wagers on the side in case it doesn’t happen to limit your losses. And for that, you don’t need it to be wholly accurate, right? You just need it to sort of approximate a given outcome that allows you to make money off of that. I think there’s sort of two ways to go with what you’re saying. One is that, until recently, prediction markets have largely been a sort of theoretical idea, right? I mean, we could talk about the stock market—or a sports book, for that matter—as a prediction market. But this sort of all-encompassing marketplace to make wagers on. I mean, recently there were wagers on the Time magazine “Person of the Year” cover, all the Oscars, all the award-season stuff. You can wager on who’s going to get nominated and who’s going to win. We’ve talked about elections already. There’s even, often, marketplaces for words getting mentioned by prominent figures in—what’s the word I’m looking for—in speeches or in, you know, earnings calls. If you believe really strongly in the idea of the wisdom of crowds, it’s very exciting. But the theoretical model of the prediction market is, as I was sort of emphasizing before, is one that everybody is participating in. The market is fully liquid. Everybody has a stake in it. Everybody is placing wagers there. And these markets are fairly far from that, right? On Election Night, there tends to be enough money, and enough people, to sort of approximate what we’ve been talking about as the conventional wisdom about who’s going to win and who’s going to lose. But that’s not always the case, and certainly not the case for stuff like these culture categories that I’m talking about. I wanted to ask—without you having to divulge whether you are, or are not, actively participating in these markets—what’s the culture like on these? I think it mirrors some of the culture on X/Twitter in the Musk era. But when you go either to try to place some wagers, or for reporting purposes,what’s the culture like? Read: So, I can talk about the culture in the comment sections—which I wouldn’t want to suggest is wholly reflective of the culture of these places in general. And I think there is a wide range. There is smart money. There are sharks out there who are running programs and bots to identify. Especially on an election night, you’ll get guys who are pulling results all doing this automated, basically HFD—like high-frequency traders pulling results from The New York Times or Decision Desk or whoever. And, like, immediately placing orders on shares to take advantage of that. Like, you don’t have to do it in the milliseconds the way you do on Wall Street, but you can do it if you just do it in a couple seconds. We’ll still make it advantageous. And you have people who are quite good—for example, the Time magazine cover leaked before it was announced. And a bunch of people made a tidy little profit, because it took a while for the market to catch up. So I say that just to say that there are smart people. Just as a to be sure thing before I get into the comments—which are really stupid. I mean, there’s just a lot of stupid people there. And there’s a funny mix of just really obviously stupid people—you know, Free Republic–commenter type, X, like bottom-of-the-barrel, Trumpist X types. And then there’s stupid, just guys who have sort of wandered in. Every wager, if you scroll far enough, you’ll find a guy who took the stupid side of the wager because he didn’t read the terms until after he’d put his $50 down. He is like, Oh, I didn’t realize that I was actually betting, you know, against this. I thought I was betting for it. Oh, well, now I’m out 50 bucks. The tone reminds me a lot of—I think the closest thing I can think of online, or the two closest things, are the: If you play fantasy football in Yahoo, every player has their own little comment section. And you can pull it up as you’re deciding who’s to start and who to bench. And it’s just filled with people just clinging to the most desperate of threads. You know, citing articles they read somewhere. Nobody’s linking to anything. Everyone’s like, Oh, I heard he is going to play. Oh, I heard he is injured. Oh, I heard he’s, you know, he’s not going to be the first QB. He’s not going to get any catches. He is not going to get any throws this game. Whatever it is. And the comments on the bets kind of remind me of this on all the markets. It’s somebody being like, Oh, you know, there’s one market that’s which member of Trump’s Cabinet is going to leave first. And everyone’s like, Well, okay, well here’s this thing I read about [Pete] Hegseth. And somebody else will be like, Well, I read this about Pam Bondi. And people doing their theories. It’s a message board. It’s not the dumbest place I’ve ever read, but it’s of a basic kind of politics message-board stupidity. It’s just that there’s all this money going on in the background. All of which is to say, when I say it’s similar to the fantasy-football chats is: It’s very male. Obviously it’s very young. Obviously, I mean—I think most of the guys are sort of in their 20s. It’s sort of confident, but Ill-informed in the way you would expect a lot of guys who to gamble in their 20s basically are. Warzel: There’s also—and I don’t mean this in a pearl-clutching way—but it’s a little reactionary. Right? Because part of what I see in the elevator pitch from some of the founders of this—it’s trying to court people who have some skepticism about the way that institutions behave, right? Kalshi’s co-founder, Tarek Mansour, I think is how you say his name. He’s really positioned this as the “wisdom of crowds,” because regular institutions have failed us, right? Because there’s this plethora of information out there, because reporters aren’t actually very good at telling, or getting, the story the way it is—come here. Not only is this a helpful tool, but that seems to recruit, just generally, people who a little bit more edgelord-y, or whatever. Yeah. Is that accurate to you? Read: I think so. I mean, I think—certainly, not to sort of underline this point—but I do think it’s worth thinking about the prediction markets in two phases. There’s, especially, the ones around politics. There’s the long phase before the election, whatever election is being bet on, happens. Which, I think, there is a—I don’t want to put a number on it, but I think that the markets tend to lean right? They just tend to overestimate Republicans. They tend to—not by a significant amount, not by the amount that you can make a ton of money off of unless you’re gambling a lot—but generally they tend to give Republicans better odds and Democrats worse odds. That’s phase one. And then, phase two is closer to the actual election. And that’s, in my experience, at least, when the smart money starts to roll in. And people come through just to pick up—basically, they take the transition from “the market’s tilting Republican” to reality setting in, and they make a quick profit off of that. And then, by the end of the night, we know who won, and the markets are settled. They’re mostly settled. So I think that: Yes, the culture, in that sense, tilts right. I think that there’s also sort of two aspects to why that is. The first is exactly as you’re saying: that there is a deep and longstanding philosophical affinity between predictions markets, the wisdom of crowds, so to speak. The idea that markets, in general, can calculate things better than institutions or humans can. That dates back to [Friedrich] Hayek and [Ludwig von] Mises. And this is sort of foundational to, you might say, neoliberalism in some broad sense. But also to a lot of the way that Silicon Valley has thought about the world since the ’90s. Right. You know, there’s this idea that we don’t want top-down people in charge. We want this sort of collective, anarchic mass of humanity working together. And a market or a quasi-market format will pull these together. So I think there is this kind of highfalutin, let’s say, philosophical background here that probably pushes the prediction markets—the people who use them and certainly the people who build them—to the right. To the kind of libertarian, hard-libertarian, market-worshiping right. But there also is a particular sort of base, reactionary nest to a lot of what goes on there, that I think is more tied in with—to some extent takes its cues from—the sort of intellectual draws that I’ve just been talking about. But is more tied into one being young and male. And gambling—young men like to gamble; young men tend to be more right wing. So I think that’s just sort of a basic demographic and sociological fact of 2025. They’re also pulling in a lot of people from X, which is just significantly more right wing than it was five years ago. And, as I was saying, they also are—without wanting to be too smug about it—they’re trying to pull in, through their marketing campaigns, pull in a lot of dumb money. To make it attractive for smart money to come in. And they do that by advertising to the biases of the reactionaries on X, basically. So, I decided to write about this because, around the time of the November elections when Zohran Mamdani was running high in New York City, but as is often the case, there’s a lot of people in New York who hated him. Who were sort of, Well, I don’t think he’s going to win. You know, I think people there [were], as you were saying, The mainstream media is ignoring all my neighbors that hate him. All my neighbors are going to vote against him. And Kalshi started running. And Polymarket, too, started running all of these. They own these, um. They run these sort of newswire accounts, that are depending on both the official accounts. But also they have their own news accounts that they don’t link to the betting sites, really. They just do these blanket, one-line, almost like a Bloomberg-terminal news thing that tends to be very misleading. Very right wing. You know, in one case Kalshi tweeted—sometimes they’ll tweet about the prediction markets. And they’ll be like, Zohran Mamdani’s position is tumbling. And that kind of thing is obviously going to bring in … you know, you could do that with liberals. I don’t wanna pretend that liberals in America are so much better at picking out misinformation and scams and whatever else. But it’s very clear who they want to appeal to on Twitter. And it’s low-social-trust gamblers, basically. Warzel: Yeah. And also, just even beyond the political part of it. Some of these accounts that are run by these prediction markets—like Kalshi, Polymarket—are just trolling, right? There’s this one image of 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey with the caption “Loves receiving balls,” right? And it was just this big sort of trade, or “on the disabled list”–style, graphic. But again, as you said, they don’t link to it. But it’s almost just kind of like, We’re having fun on here, too. Why don’t you come have fun on our place, and, you know, take advantage of this? But, you talk about this dumb money. And you described it, in this great Substack post that we’ll link to, as the part of the male “suckerification crisis.” And can you elaborate a little more on that? I think that’s sort of your corollary to the male loneliness crisis they’re in. But what are you saying here? Read: I feel like one of the big stories on the internet—and in society at large—over the last five years or so has been the extent to which young men have fallen under the spell, or the sway, of a variety of different kinds of scammers, hucksters, fraudsters. When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money. Though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of—both commercial and political—apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money. And I think that there’s something about, I don’t have a grand … you know, this is more of a corkboard-and-red-yarn theory than an equation, right? Warzel: We love that. Read: But I see these connections. I see these sort of basic dynamics play out in straight old-fashioned sports gambling, which has sort of taken over sports media. That was legalized a few years ago and now kind of dominates the way we talk about sports in the country. At least, in the media that has written about sports and filmed about sports. I see it in prediction markets as well. Talking about this, sort of, Kalshi and Polymarket Twitter feeds that we’re talking about. You know, the sense that This is gambling kind of creeping into even more layers of life, layers of social life. I see it in the kind of manosphere-influencer guys. These sort of perennial subjects, objects of moral panic. But, you know—the main sort of dynamic I see there is not necessarily even kind of ideological, radicalization on the part of somebody like Andrew Tate. But the way that they are selling a particular story and a particular product to a bunch of young men that kind of cultivates them as suckers, that turns them into suckers. And I think that Trumpist politics—by which I mean both the Republican Party under Donald Trump, but also all kinds of right-wing, reactionary politics—emerge out of the same sort of soup. You know. This highly emotive insistence that—as you sort of put it earlier—Institutions are failing you, but we’ve got the cure. We’ve got the ticket; you can participate in this movement. You can show everybody that you’re smarter than everybody else. Here’s the secret to making money. Here’s the secret to, you know, winning in politics. Here’s the secret to getting girls. Whatever it is. It’s funny to me how much you can sort of see that same dynamic across what should, theoretically, be these quite different kinds of spheres. But seem to, in fact, kind of be converging on this one sort of business model, more or less. You know, just to provide some historical perspective—Rick Perlstein, the historian, has a really wonderful essay in The Baffler from maybe 10 or more years ago that I think about all the time in terms of this. I think it’s called “The Long Con.” And it’s about the origins of the conservative movement in the 1950s and the extent to which the conservative movement has always been deeply tangled up with, basically, snake-oil mailing lists. That a huge part of what powers the conservative movement is access to mailing lists of low social trust. Reactionary voters who are willing to buy what you’re selling if you speak the right language, more or less. And, as I was saying before, I think Twitter feels sort of like a really sophisticated version of that. And I think that this whole complex of businesses are finding new ways to sort of exploit that particular dynamic. And, to some extent, I think this is a sort of layered process, right? That you go on Twitter—it’s a social media site. It’s, you know, highly volatile. You’re constantly feeling like everybody else is getting more views than you. You’re constantly sort of feeling you’re in this strange space that you don’t necessarily understand. You know, you’re surrounded by people who are expressing that same strange feeling. It feels a lot like being in the economy, too, doesn’t it? And isn’t politics also this strange, volatile space? Surely there’s a way we can all make a little extra money off of it. We’re constantly in competition. It’s not a hard-and-fast theory. It’s this set of affective triggers, right? These sort of—this vibe that’s out there that seems to be quite inescapable. In particular for, you know, recent college graduates. Kids in college, even in high school, Warzel: Right. And there’s this way that it’s this reinforcing system, right? If you do fall into those, into that mindset, you enter into a place that sort of embraces the chaos, embraces the precarity therein, right? And then feeling all that gives you. The only possible way out, right? The only possible latch onto a kind of, you know, new version of the American Dream. Which is just like, I buy this memecoin low, I sell high. Right? I get in this place here, and it’s—but that usually doesn’t work out well for most people, right? A lot of the dumb money. And then you get back in this cycle of precarity resentment. Okay, now we have the antidote to that. And the cycle just repeats over and over again. Read: One thing I would add, that I didn’t really write about in this piece—but that has been something on my mind for a long time, because I feel it too—is a sort of increasing sense in American society that everybody else is getting one over on you and/or the system. And that in fact, if you let everybody else get one over on you, you are weak, and you have made a mistake. You know, you are a sucker. When, in fact, I think in many ways it’s sort of the reverse. That it’s like, if you’re constantly trying—if you’re the one who’s constantly trying to get one over—you probably are a sucker yourself. And, you know, I think there’s—I mean, the root cause here, I would say, is sort of society-wide breakdown of trust in institutions. You know, in the sense that institutions are in it for themselves, and they are, you know, corrupt. And giving handouts to their people and not to you. Again, this is also this sort of vibe that seeps out and powers a lot of the kind of activity around predictions markets. But also around a bunch of these other businesses and figures. Warzel: I wanna test out a theory on all this that’s maybe another side of it. Or maybe it’s just this in a different skin, but which is, very broadly, this idea that it’s exceedingly hard in a mature attention economy to sell something, right? And it is because of all the competition for attention. And it’s much easier to sell a derivative of that thing. I read this post a couple weeks ago that was talking about movie marketing, and how it’s kind of just gone haywire. And this idea that stars are doing things that aren’t like a traditional junket, where they’re talking about the film with a hundred different people. But they’re going on a hundred different podcasts or, you know, video shows or whatever. And basically doing viral skits, right? You can kind of start at Hot Ones. But then you can trace this to Jennifer Lawrence and her co-star Robert Pattinson doing lie-detector tests, right? A lot of celebrities doing lie-detector tests for Vanity Fair or whatever. And it’s good content. People watch it. People are interested in it. It’s good for the timeline. But it historically is not selling these movies, right? Because they’re not talking about the film. They’re talking about themselves in the hope that they’re going to garner enough attention to sell a film. Right? And, I think of that idea of a derivative of something. I think about it, very obviously, with sports gambling, right? Leagues are interested in having this, because it does draw attention to the games, right? Adam Silver, the NBA’s commissioner, wrote this op-ed 10 years ago or so, kind of advocating to legalize sports gambling. And there’s this idea that it will draw in interest and attention to this event. But it’s interest and attention essentially to, you know, a game within a game. Right? People are interested in hitting the over; they’re interested in, you know, how many free throws so-and-so gets. Or, you know, misses. Or whatever, right? And I’m curious if you feel this too? That—we see it with elections, right? It doesn’t matter so much about the outcome as much as it is getting the edge. And this idea of financialization of everything. Just creating derivatives of everything to the point where it’s almost impossible to sell a thing. Read: Yeah. I mean, I think that this is part of the attraction of the prediction market over the regular sports book, too. I guess it’s not just derivatives; it’s securitization. And that you create this object that you can sell and resell at whatever. You know, I don’t want to drive the metaphor off a cliff or whatever. But one of the interesting things about those viral videos of, say, Pattinson and Jennifer Lawrence doing the lie-detector test, as you say—probably not very useful for marketing the movie. But that video is now useful to Vanity Fair, or whoever it was that filmed it. And will be useful to them for 10 years, because those are going to be famous people that people will wanna see for 10 years. Lord knows, there’s no time limit for anything on the internet. You now have this thing that just kind of exists in the world. And I think that there’s a real difficulty to find ways to have those derivatives, to maintain their relationship to the bigger project that’s supposed to be pushing forward. The other thing, I would say, that sports thing—what you were saying about sports makes me think is that part of this is about media in general. Right? That we’re increasingly difficult to figure out how to pay for the media that exists, and that we think of presumably as sort of integral to democracy. To our liberal democratic system. And sports arguably runs a little bit ahead of political media, news media, in terms of business models and whatever else. And one of the big reasons that Adam Silver has been an advocate for legalizing gambling—and one of the reasons why all of the media companies, ESPN chief among them, have so enthusiastically embraced sports betting—is that we sort of have reached peak sports. We’re a little bit over the hill in peak sports. Basketball is a very good example, because—you know, Mark Cuban was talking about this just last year—nobody thinks the next few TV deals are going to be anywhere near as lucrative as the last few TV deals are. Where the question is: Who is making money and how are they making money? And that’s not just the question for the team owners, who will always make money from the stadium, right? And from the actual games themselves. But how is ESPN going to make money? And the answer, right now, seems to be gambling. We’re going to take gambling sponsorships; we’re going to talk about gambling all the time. So when we talk about, like Kalshi and Polymarket. You know, why is CNN so enthusiastic about bringing them on? I mean, they already are, in fact, partnering with Kalshi to, I think—or maybe with Polymarket—to produce odds for them on Election Night. And presumably elsewhere during the political season. And so I think there’s the other part of it, in addition to the kind of structural. The way we think about marketing and attention is to break things off into these little pieces that can be bought and sold. In the last 10 years, it’s that we are facing a crisis for how we pay for these things. And gambling is a traditionally fairly lucrative industry to be in. And, you know, that’s a way that CNN could take itself. Warzel: You don’t want Cousin Sal to moderate Meet the Press going forward. I feel like that’s a great idea. The partnership is between Kalshi and CNN, and I think that, you’re absolutely right about the “paying for it” part of it. Which is obviously the most important part. I also think that there is this attentional quality that injects a little bit of—I’m trying to think about this. You know, it feels so dystopian having CNN’s Harry Enten, the polling guy, is going to be the one who’s going to be doing the big board and looking through the Kalshi odds, what they’ve said. And it feels a little dystopian to have that partnership. But also, it injects, I think—for them trying to rationalize it in some way—some excitement into something. That, when you said we’ve reached peak sports a while back, we’ve reached peak politics too. We are well beyond peak politics, where everyone is just sort of ground down by, you know, how this works. But also kind of strangely, terminally addicted to it at the same time. You can’t quit it, but there’s nothing in it. And this is sort of—whatever derivative, a securitization. It’s some element that I think also injects … people joke about horse-race coverage. And it’s like, no: We’re actually making a horse race now. Read: The problem with horse-race coverage was that we didn’t have the horse race yet. Warzel: Our mutual friend and fellow tech writer John Herrman wrote a thing for the Neiman Lab’s year-end predictions here for 2026—that the media will become addicted to gambling, follow the path of sports media. It’s very smart. Do you feel like this is just going to get worse? Where do you see this all moving? Is it just increasingly lawless, like we’re just going to, you know, fall victim to all this? Do you think this is a kind of a fad? Do you think this is maybe something that actually is the injection of capital that these places need? How do you sort of project it going forward? Read: I am not necessarily as pessimistic. I think that the forces are arrayed in favor of the prediction market becoming a sort of dominant means by which we interpret and understand the world around us. There’s a lot of money behind that—and there’s a lot of powerful philosophical and political ideas that want to see something like this, you know, take a larger role in society. And the truth is, in addition to … I don’t even mean to make it sound that sinister. Like, from a banker’s point of view, a stock trader’s point of view, having all these extra hedging instruments is useful. From the point of view of CNN on Election Night, setting aside this sort of question of how much gambling is going to dominate CNN, the prediction markets give us something to talk about that is not that different in terms of its relationship to reality—from polls, say. So all this stuff is the money, the philosophy, the use. All that stuff is lined up in a way that gives prediction markets, I think, a big sort of runway to find themselves. To become more and more prominent. And to intermediate more areas of life. That being said, we’ve seen, since 2022—when, I think, sports gambling was legalized in New York—we’ve seen how much sports gambling has taken over sports media. How much sports betting has sort of become this ubiquitous thing in coverage. But my impression—and I think this bears out in most of the polling that’s been done recently—so people actually hate this. Even the young men who are supposed to be the customers don’t really like it very much. And I think that same quality is going to be true of prediction markets. I think there’s a very particular—this is just baseless theorization right here; this is my own version of astrology—but I think there’s a certain kind of person whose brain works in this particular, let’s say Bayesian way. Where they are constantly thinking about things in terms of odds. Where they are calculating in their own heads, you know, arbitrage opportunities and what kinds of bets they’re willing to, you know. They’re doing Kelly criterion bets and whatever calculations in their heads. And I think for those people, these things are incredibly exciting. I think those people are also really heavily concentrated in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, basically. Those are the places you go if that’s the kind of brain you have. I think a lot of the rest of us find it … I mean, I could speak for myself alone, but I know I’m not alone. That kind of way of being in the world—way of thinking about the world—is exhausting. You’re not really thinking about the game. You’re thinking about the over; you’re thinking about the props that you’ve put together. You’re thinking about the parlay across the three different games. I think that prediction markets being inserted everywhere else has a very similar kind of quality to it. I wonder if there’s a happy medium? I think with sports betting, what many people sort of now these days believe is that there should not be apps for it. It shouldn’t really be legal. There should be a guy that if you have the social wherewithal to find, you can place a bet with, right? But it shouldn’t be the kind of thing where they just roll out the red carpet, and there’s a lubricated path to losing all of your money. And I’m pretty sympathetic to that. I don’t know if that makes me an old man. Warzel: I think what you’re saying is: Friction is a good thing, right? Friction is helpful here. And a lot of these betting apps … I actually can’t speak to Kalshi or Polymarket, but like the the DraftKings, FanDuel—they’re literally sending push notifications. Of like, This is about to happen. You know, whatever it is. It’s not even neutral, in the sense that it’s easily accessible. It’s like the bookie is sitting on your couch, you know? Asking you if you’d like to get in on this. Right? So you have that element; you have the idea that gambling itself in all things—whether it’s on elections, whether it’s on whatever—gambling is not a static thing, right? Every different type. There’s so many different types of gambling, of ways to bet, that can give you slightly better odds. Or that are, you know, based off of skill instead of blind luck. And the idea that the closer you get to the slot machine, right? Just pull and, you know, a couple of things have to line up—that’s the worst part of gambling. And that’s what we are moving toward; this tech-enabled stuff tends to resemble that more than it resembles, you know, betting on who’s going to win in a golf match, with your friends or whatever. And then I think you’re right about the exhaustion of it all. And it reminds me of the nature of these companies, right? This focus and need on scaling. A lot of these companies—like Kalshi just raised a billion dollars earlier in December from some of the major tech venture capitalists. They’re obviously going to need to scale. Their CEO said now, infamously, the goal is to financialize every single difference of opinion in the world. Which, as you put, is patently the most exhausting thing you could imagine. No disagreement goes unmonetized is like—just end it all now. I think, unlike you, I do feel it’s a little sinister. Listening to you talk about the relationship of the risk, the volatility, you know, the gambling, the sort of reactionary poking and prodding and trolling on X to get you in the funnel, to put you into this precarious situation. All of that, to me, actually feels it is bad. And that feels dominant to me, over “This is a really great way to get a bird’s-eye view of a situation.” Read: I probably am being too kind. I do think it is sinister. And I think that it’s bad in an absolute sense. But I am, also—I feel like it’s good to be conscious of the uses that it has. And the kinds of forces that are arrayed in its favor. And that it’s not a cash grab, and it’s not a kind of, necessarily, a pure philosophical dispute—that there are serious institutions for whom this represents a windfall or a new method of doing what they do. I wonder a little bit. Let me preface this by saying this, as a sort of depressing thought that I’m not necessarily endorsing. But, you know, one reason I think that sports gambling has taken off so wildly—and one reason I think even stuff like fantasy football, which is in some ways quite similar to gambling, but obviously also very different in important ways—is the extent to which sports as a pastime, or as an entertainment, represent a kind of … I’ll take baseball for an example. Say that baseball is kind of a solved game. You have a pretty good sense at the very beginning of the season. You know people are very good at projecting who’s going to win, how many wins there’re going to be. What you’re waiting for is injuries. And then, the playoffs. It’s not luck, but it’s basically luck. I say that, you know—it’s probably the greatest World Series of my lifetime, this past year. But one thing that I think that gambling allows us to do in in a world—in, like, the NBA, when a third of regular-season games, most of the stars just flat out aren’t playing. Which I know that the NBA hates, but is also exactly what you need to do, because that’s a problem that has now been solved by resting people. What you find yourself wanting to get: the sense of volatility—the sense of unexpected delight and whatever else gambling becomes—the way you get out of sports. That what feels harder and harder to get as more and more money gets applied to, like, figuring out the secrets to winning each one of these. And I’m not sure what the way to apply that is as a metaphor to the rest of the world out there. But I think that part of what the attraction here, too, is taking things that have been optimized to hell. Like, whatever it is. The things that no longer give you the same kind of burst of enjoyment because you know what to expect from them, at all times. And the gambling—you know, the prediction market, the gambling, the wagers. They give you that little extra burst of dopamine, energy, enjoyment, excitement. Because all of a sudden you’re attaching some money to something that isn’t the necessarily even the main point of the game. And I think, to me, that’s depressing. Because I’m sympathetic to it. Right. Though I’m sympathetic to that desire to try and find the same kind of enjoyment. But also because that’s the thing that, I think, hooks people—more than the sort of sense that, Oh, I can find the edge by doing my calculations in my head. And every dispute is going to be financialized, and we’re going to figure that out. It’s more like: I just wanna take a little risk somewhere. Like, a fairly safe risk. Just to give myself … just to feel something, somewhere. Just to feel something. Warzel: The thing that makes me think about with sports—especially in baseball, where we’re about to go into, a year from now, these major labor disputes with the unions—is this inequality, right? There is this fundamental inequality in baseball between the haves and the have-nots. And the big-market teams and the Cincinnati Reds. Or like, you know, what have you. And in that, you do have that situation often in a fanbase of Okay, well, if we make the playoffs, we’re going to get, you know, absolutely destroyed in the first round. And that’s a good year. And “enjoy the ride,” right? But it’s getting something else there. And then when I try to think—does that apply broadly out to politics? Of course, maybe not exactly, right? It’s not a total inequality thing. But it is this sort of feeling like the system isn’t going to move, right? Like it’s sclerotic in this way. Like you’re not going to get a candidate that’s just going to come out of nowhere, unless you have, you know, these instances like Mamdani. Read: I mean, look at how much energy, I mean, even Kamala Harris’s emergence—in 18 hours as the Democratic nominee, after [Joe] Biden [dropped out], had that burst of energy. Because it was such an unexpected historical event. Even if she was, you know, not the most exciting candidate to young people in the world, or whatever. She was a sort of—exactly who you would’ve “expect the unexpectedness” about. It gave that extra bit of energy. Warzel: I think that that is such a good way to frame all of this in a world that’s feeling a little bit locked, right? Where everything seems a little locked, this is injecting a kind of chaos that allows people to feel. Read: I think that’s real. Well, the other thing—and I would say two things on top of that. One is: I think—just to reconnect some of the stuff we were talking about before—I think it is relatively similar to some of the appeal of social networks, which have a volatility to them. And I think that one of the reasons that Twitter is less—and Facebook too, are less and less, and Instagram even—become less and less interesting to people is probably because they become sort of solved games. And, you know, what does well in the algorithm. What does well. It’s much harder to have that pop of the thing that you get really early on a social network—always like, I’ve never seen something like this before. This is so weird. This kind of person, you could still sort of find it there. But those that like volatility, it’s there in a certain limited way. But not in the same way. The other thing, I would say, is that this feeling we’re talking about—I think what’s at stake is a sense that there’s very little to surprise us anymore. And this is, again, a sort of a vibe more than it is a fact. But there is this vibe of, like, Everything’s optimized to hell. Everybody, for the most part, acts really cautious in their given settings, the domains in which they’re playing. It’s hard to find surprise. Gambling at least gives us some level of, you know—allows us to feel something, as we put it. But what prediction markets effectively do, over the long term, is even eliminate that from gambling. Because what you’re doing—once the market is big enough, once enough people are betting—all of a sudden all the surprises are kind of gone. Except for weather events, right? It’s the last thing that you could bet on: where there’s some possibly there won’t be rain, despite the 90 percent–chance forecast the next day. And I think it’s self-defeating. I suppose. I don’t like … that’s a science-fiction story more than it is something that we really have to worry about at this point. But I think that ultimately the point of the prediction market is to reassert the primacy of locked-in predictions. Even if what makes it interesting right now is the enjoyment of risk and novelty and surprise. Warzel: I love the idea that eventually the prediction market, it eats its own young at the end of it. I think that’s a great place to leave it. Max Read, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain. Read: It was absolutely my pleasure. Thanks for this great conversation.

Title: Games industry layoff figures were down slightly in 2025 – but it was still horrendous | Year in Review
URL: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/games-industry-layoff-figures-were-down-slightly-in-2025-but-it-was-still-horrendous-year-in-review
Time Published: 2025-12-19T18:23:06Z
Full Content:
Although layoffs were down by around a third, studios in the US and Western Europe may have been hit by the trend for jobs moving to emerging markets Conditions remain tough in the games industry, and layoff figures were still high in 2025, although down from their peak in 2024. Amir Satvat, business development director at Tencent Games, maintains a widely used resource for helping people find jobs in the games industry, and for the past few years he has been tracking and forecasting layoff numbers. Crucially, he attempts to include layoffs that were not publicly reported, as well as using his community connections to find out actual figures for layoffs when companies report them without listing the numbers of people affected. At the time of writing, Satvat has settled on a figure of 9,175 games industry layoffs in 2025, just shy of the prediction of 9,769 he made back in January. That's dramatically down on the estimated 15,631 layoffs in 2024, although still higher than the estimated 8,500 layoffs in 2022, when the current games industry crisis kicked in. Satvat predicts that we'll see another 7,500 layoffs in 2026, pointing towards a slow recovery in the industry. However, he thinks that the share of open roles in North America and Western Europe will continue to decrease. Earlier this year, he told The Games Business that "over 70%, and in some years 75%, of the layoffs have been in North America," with AAA studios being particularly affected, and with more than 50% of cuts taking place in California. Similarly, a survey released in October found more than 26% of European game professionals were laid off in the past year, with median salaries dropping dramatically compared with 2024. "Salaries for programmers – especially Unity developers – have dropped by almost half, mainly because there are barely any open positions," said Tanja Loktionova, founder of Values Value and co-founder of InGame Job, the companies behind the survey. "There have been a lot of layoffs and very few new opportunities." Satvat predicts that whereas job opportunities will decrease in Western Europe and North America, they will increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. That tallies with comments made during this year's GamesIndustry.biz Investment Panel by Lirui Ding, principal at the gaming venture capital firm Transcend Fund, about the games industry's ongoing geographical shift. "We're really seeing a lot of money actually going from the US and Europe to other emerging markets," he explained, "whether it's China, Turkey, or even Vietnam." Chris Petrovic, chief business officer and board chairman at the developer and publisher FunPlus, made similar comments in a GamesIndustry.biz feature in December, where he predicted that the industry would grow, but in different areas of the globe. "Previously, we talked a lot about gaming innovation, creativity, and commercial success coming from places like the United States, Canada, Germany, and Finland," he said, "and now we are increasingly talking about emerging game dev hubs like China, Turkey, Israel, and Vietnam." 2025 saw a number of studio closures, including Toadman Interactive, Freejam, nDreams Studio Orbital and nDreams Studio, Thunderful-owned Studio Fizbin, Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop Studios, Zynga-owned Echtra Games, Dundee-based Cobra Mobile, Microsoft-owned The Initiative, Avalanche Studios Group's Liverpool studio, Ubisoft Leamington, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, Fantastic Pixel Castle, Bad Brain Game Studios, and three Warner Bros. Games studios: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. Reports also alleged that Ballistic Moon, the UK-based developer of the Until Dawn remake, was "effectively closed" after almost all its staff were laid off, while Aheartfulofgames, the Spanish studio behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, said it faced closure after owner Outright Games signalled its intention to make all employees at the studio redundant. In addition, the UK-based studios Three Fields Entertainment and Splash Damage both began redundancy consultations affecting all employees. Dozens of studios cut staff numbers in 2025, including: In terms of the biggest gaming companies, Tencent Games made a number of cuts and divestments at its European studios. In February, the Tencent-owned Sumo Group announced it would be refocusing "exclusively on development services for partners," which would "have an impact on our studios and people." It sold off publisher Secret Mode in March. In June, Sumo-owned studio The Chinese Room made a small number of layoffs before revealing it would be going independent. In January, Splash Damage – which was bought by Tencent in 2020 – said jobs were at risk following the cancellation of Transformers: Reactivate. In September, the studio said it had been acquired by private-equity investors, then in November the entire studio was placed in consultation ahead of redundancies. In October, Oslo-based Funcom, which is owned by Tencent and is behind the open-world survival game Dune: Awakening, said it would be making job cuts as part of a restructuring. And in November, Tencent-owned studio Sharkmob, which is working on the sci-fi extraction shooter Exoborne, said it was making job cuts at its Malmo studio. NetEase studio Jar of Sparks said in January that it would be looking for a new publishing partner after NetEase pulled its funding. "As we prepare for this next step, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities," said founder and CEO Jerry Hook. Then in February, the NetEase-backed studio Liquid Swords, which was established by Christofer Sundberg, the co-founder of Avalanche Studios, reported a round of job cuts. A few days later, NetEase confirmed layoffs at a US support studio for Marvel Rivals, hours before revealing the game had 40 million players. NetEase also shut down T-Minus Zero Entertainment (which was later resurrected by a "small group of veteran directors and founders"), divested Fantastic Pixel Castle (which subsequently closed), and pulled out of Bad Brain Game Studios, a studio it had set up in 2023, which closed after it failed to find a new publisher. Microsoft made some major job cuts in 2025. After a relatively small round of layoffs in January, the firm announced a 3% cut to its staff in May. But the biggest round of job cuts came in July, affecting an estimated 9,000 people, or around 4% of Microsoft's workforce, and causing a major shake-up in Microsoft's games division. Studios affected included King, Blizzard, Turn 10, Raven Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, and The Initiative, with the latter being shuttered. Microsoft's console rival Sony made cuts too, laying off staff at the PlayStation support studio Visual Arts and PS Studios Malaysia, as well as initiating redundancies at Days Gone maker Bend Studio. Unity implemented another round of cuts in February, following around 1,800 job losses in January 2024, and Amazon announced an enormous 14,000 layoffs in October, which resulted in work ceasing on the MMO New World. Intel, meanwhile, announced layoffs in April and July as part of cost-cutting measures. Meta laid off a number of people in 2025, cutting 5% of staff in January, and then making further cuts to the Reality Labs division in April. But there could be bigger cuts to come, after Bloomberg reported that Meta is allegedly planning to slash budgets in its Reality Labs division by as much as 30% in 2026. Netflix-owned Night School Studio cut an undisclosed number of staff in February, and Krafton-owned Striking Distance Studios – which was behind The Callisto Protocol – made layoffs in March. Square Enix, meanwhile, implemented a "fundamental restructuring" in November, pulling resources away from "overseas" development studios and putting over 100 jobs at risk. Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics cut staff in March, August, and November, before unveiling Tomb Raider: Catalyst at the Game Awards in December, which is being published by Amazon. In addition, the Embracer studio Eidos Montreal, which was behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, was allegedly hit with layoffs in December, following an earlier round of cuts in March. In February, Warner Bros. Games announced it was shuttering Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros San Diego, as well as cancelling its upcoming Wonder Woman game. Monolith had been operating for over 30 years, and was behind games such as No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Player First Games was behind the brawler MultiVersus, and Warner acquired the studio in July 2024 before cancelling the game in January 2025. Ubisoft made numerous job cuts in 2025. In January, it made redundancies at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections, and announced the closure of Ubisoft Leamington. Then in July, it announced 19 layoffs at the Tom Clancy: Ghost Recon studio Red Storm, followed by nine job losses in the publishing team in September. Finally, in October, it unveiled a "restructuring proposal" for the Finland-based RedLynx studio that could affect up to 60 positions, shortly before announcing plans to offer voluntary redundancies to staff at its Swedish subsidiary Massive Entertainment. EA also cut a number of jobs this year, beginning with the EA studio Respawn cancelling two "early-stage" incubation projects and cutting developers from its Apex Legends and Star Wars: Jedi teams, resulting in approximately 100 layoffs. On the same day, EA announced a further 200 job losses, chiefly affecting EA's Experiences team. A day later, EA said it was "pausing development" of the World Rally Championship series, leading to layoffs at Codemasters. Finally, there were a number of cuts at studios owned by Take-Two Interactive. 2K Games confirmed in August that it had "reduced the size of the development team" working on BioShock 4, which is being developed by the Californian studio Cloud Chamber. Then in September, 2K confirmed a "reduction" in the headcount at Civilization and XCOM developer Firaxis. But most controversially, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) accused Take-Two-owned Rockstar Games of union busting after the studio dismissed 31 employees who were allegedly attempting to unionise at the end of October. The move led to protests outside Rockstar's offices and the sending of a letter condemning the dismissals that was signed by 220 employees at Rockstar North. Rockstar disputes the claims of union busting, saying the employees were fired for gross misconduct after discussing "confidential information in a public forum." However, UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the dismissals as a "deeply concerning case" and said that ministers would investigate. This article has been updated to add the various Warner Bros. Games studio closures. All the biggest stories, expert analysis and data, straight to your inbox.

December 19, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Interview Kickstart Interview Kickstart SANTA CLARA, CA, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While much of the public narrative around the technology sector has focused on layoffs and workforce reductions, industry analysts point to a parallel and more consequential shift unfolding beneath the headlines. One organization addressing the growing gap between AI talent demand and available expertise is Interview Kickstart, whose Advanced Machine Learning Course is designed to help professionals build production-ready AI skills aligned with hiring expectations at large technology companies. Major technology companies are concentrating resources around artificial intelligence engineering at an unprecedented scale, signaling a structural transformation in how technical talent is hired, organized, and valued across the industry. The multi-month program spans core programming fundamentals through advanced machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and deployment practices, with instruction led by engineers from FAANG and other Tier-1 firms. More information about the course is available at https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course#interview-preparation. Public workforce data and industry research indicate that AI engineering teams at companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Meta have expanded significantly over the past several years, even as broader headcount reductions occurred elsewhere. By late 2024, these firms collectively employed tens of thousands of engineers in roles dedicated to machine learning, generative AI, data infrastructure, and applied AI systems. Analysts note that this concentration of AI expertise has few historical precedents in the technology sector. This expansion reflects deliberate strategic repositioning rather than reactive hiring. In the years leading up to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools, large technology firms increased investment in AI talent, computing infrastructure, and internal research capacity. Hiring trends from 2019 through 2024 show sustained growth in specialized AI roles, suggesting that companies were anticipating changes in how products and services would be built and delivered. Notably, this hiring momentum continued even during periods of broader workforce contraction. While companies reduced staffing in areas such as marketing, operations, and general administration, AI engineering teams were largely protected and, in some cases, expanded. Industry observers interpret this as a clear signal that AI-related roles are viewed as central to long-term competitiveness rather than discretionary investments. The resulting labor market has become increasingly segmented. Professionals with experience building and deploying AI systems at scale are in high demand, while roles centered on routine implementation or narrowly scoped tasks face growing automation pressure. Recruiters report that AI engineering positions often require experience beyond theoretical knowledge, including hands-on work with large language models, data pipelines, distributed systems, and production deployment. This demand has outpaced supply. Despite sustained hiring efforts, many organizations report difficulty filling AI engineering roles due to a shortage of candidates with relevant, production-level experience. As a result, qualified professionals are often able to choose among multiple opportunities, particularly at organizations with significant AI infrastructure and research investments. However, industry analysts emphasize that access to these roles depends on depth of expertise. Companies are not simply seeking familiarity with AI concepts; they are evaluating candidates on their ability to design, implement, and maintain complex systems under real-world constraints. This includes considerations such as scalability, reliability, performance optimization, and responsible deployment. The distinction between conceptual understanding and applied expertise has become increasingly important. Professionals who have built and operated AI systems in production environments are better positioned to meet hiring criteria than those whose exposure is limited to coursework or isolated experiments. This has led many engineers and data professionals to pursue structured upskilling as a way to bridge the gap. Interview Kickstart's Advanced Machine Learning Course is structured around this industry reality. The program emphasizes applied learning through live instruction, hands-on projects, and capstone work modeled on real business scenarios across sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare, cybersecurity, and financial technology. According to the company, the curriculum is regularly updated to reflect emerging requirements, including agent-based systems, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, scalable model deployment, and machine learning operations. In addition to technical training, the program integrates interview preparation and career coaching.

Title: Economic Sentiment Collapses to All-Time Lows, Why?

If you only looked at the gold standard(?) Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey’s new report, you would think we were in the midst of a generational economic crash surpassing the scale of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis or the stagflationary malaise of the 1970s where the Misery Index hit all-time highs. A new survey is out today, and it reveals a populace with incredibly negative forward-looking views on the economy. This certainly is related to Trump, who per a recent AP-NORC poll, had his lowest approval rating ever on the economy (31%), which surely helped prompt president sundown to rant to the country on primetime TV this week. But the fact that the 2025 line is digging down as deep as the 2022 line proves that this is not a Trump-centric dynamic, and people feel bad about the economy for reasons that go beyond tariffs and all his other ineffectual bullshit. Source: University of Michigan via FRED® Those grey bars indicate recessions, revealing why this is, or perhaps was, looked to as a gold standard for consumer sentiment. By the pattern established over the last half-century, there should be grey bars in 2022 and right now, and yet, GDP is growing. One might think this is because of our age of inequality, where this survey picks up the bulk of people struggling while the economy is held up by the wealthy (a dynamic that is true that I will dig into in the K-shaped recovery section), but the truth is that wage growth for the lowest earners has grown relative to higher earners since the pandemic. As Matt Darling demonstrates by parsing out the consumer sentiment data, a lot of this new negative sentiment is actually coming from the top income tercile, revealing the backlash from capital against labor in response to the strong labor market we experienced in the wake of the pandemic shock. There is not one singular explanation for what is happening to the economic vibes in America. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index [image or embed] — Matt Darling (@besttrousers.bsky.social) December 18, 2025 at 6:17 AM This has become an exhausting debate because a lot of people who lack economic expertise are certain that either non-economists like Will Stancil are right and everyone has gone completely insane, or those dogpiling him in his mentions claiming that the GDP figures are lies and we actually have been in a Great Depression for a few years are certain they’re right. If you pay attention to the actual trained economic knowers, certainty is not a feature of their analysis. That has been beaten out of every one of us to step into a serious financial arena. You know nothing. You are nothing. The whole world is a range of probabilities, and you will be humbled by it. All we can say for certain is that after the pandemic, the vibes drastically changed for a lot of Americans, and you can see it in the split between the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence survey and the University of Michigan’s. 🚨USE THE CONFERENCE BOARD MEASURE OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE! IGNORE MICHIGAN–DO NOT RUN AWAY WITH GRANDIOSE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORLD BASED ON UMICH!🚨 [image or embed] — Julia Coronado (@jc-econ.bsky.social) December 19, 2025 at 9:22 AM Their methodologies are different, which certainly gives us some insight into the post-2020 divergence. The Conference Board asks respondents about current business and employment conditions as well as business conditions, employment, and income expectations six months from now, while UMich asks people about their personal finances, buying conditions and future expectations for the economy. It’s clear now that for economic forecasters, survey questions about personal finances are not useful to understanding a broader economy chugging along fairly well in large part thanks to gargantuan AI capital expenditure spending. That the United States has grown out of the pandemic far faster than its peers is also lost in all the bad vibes. But something is clearly going on that’s deeper than ‘people let TikTok make them think they’re destitute’ or ‘economic data is bourgeois bullshit,’ and I will venture some guesses here as to what is happening. Because despite all the online squabbling that has taken place around the vibecession since 2022, there is something real and important to all this. Consumer sentiment roughly translates to consumer spending, the engine of our economy (at least before AI), hence why recessions coincide with collapses in it. This is serious stuff, and it can’t all be handwaved away as vibes. This is a title of a 2021 paper from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and you don’t need an economics degree to understand the point it makes, just look at the shape of the letter K. One diagonal line is going up, and the other is going down, resembling the most important chart in American politics and economics over the last fifty years. Americans don’t get paid well relative to the productivity we create. Capitalism is built by capital, and so the spoils of it go to them. This has been true for decades, as the above chart demonstrates, so this cynicism is clearly not solely responsible for the recent drop in consumer sentiment, but I do think this raw deal has become more salient since the pandemic. I screenshotted these charts from the BLS report which tracked percentage changes in employment from February 2020 to May 2021, broken down by five income buckets, and a clear pattern emerges. Pay attention to the orange lines tracking employment loss due to closures. People at different income levels live in different worlds. Digging into the vibecession stuff again today and I think these charts from a 2021 BLS paper on the K-shaped recovery are instructive. www.bls.gov/osmr/researc… [image or embed] — Jacob Weindling (@jakeweindling.bsky.social) December 19, 2025 at 10:22 AM As I detailed in my piece about the poverty line last month, it’s a lot higher than our mainstream discourse thinks. It’s not $140,000 per year like one viral economic blogger suggested, but a much more thoughtful measure called Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed households (ALICE) finds that 42% of American households—55 million—fall below their financial hardship threshold. It is adjusted for cost of living by county, and this gets to the heart of the alleged K-shaped recovery that admittedly has become a bit messier of a narrative as time has gone on and lower income wages have grown, although the core structure of the letter remains in place as a broader economic principle. “If there’s a single stat to capture what’s happening to the economy, it’s this: The top 10% of U.S. earners now make up half of all spending, and it’s changing everything,” wrote journalist Matt Pearce today. “Delta Air Lines expects to make more money soon from luxury and business fliers at the front of the plane than from everybody else.” I wrote about this revelation from Moody’s Analytics earlier this year, and how connected it is to the stock market creating a wealth effect fueling this spending. “Affluent people also found themselves with assets, such as stocks, that suddenly were worth far more,” wrote the Wall Street Journal back in February. “The net worth of the top 20% of earners has risen by more than $35 trillion, or 45%, since the end of 2019, according to Federal Reserve data. Net worth grew at a similar rate for everyone else, but it translated to a lot less money: an increase of $14 trillion for the bottom 80%.” Many Stancilites will point to the fact that wage growth for the lowest earners has outpaced those of higher earners, but fail to recognize the facts of a rate of change metric. Look at those charts I screenshotted above, measuring from 2020 is measuring from a complete collapse, and while ten steps back and seven steps forward does give you a pretty good rate of change result, you’re still down a net of three steps from where you started. That’s the employment situation a lot of low wage earners are dealing with these days in our cooling job market, and jobs like cashiers that once were some of the most prevalent in America are now being replaced by robots. The same is true for entry level college graduates, as the bottom layer of many organizational charts is being replaced with AI as we speak. That may help the company save money and aid executives’ spending fueled by their stock-based compensation that makes topline economic figures look good, but it doesn’t do much for the low wage worker whose job is being replaced and isn’t seeing the benefits of the broader economy. In many ways, AI is the poster child for the K-shaped economy. Executives like Elon Musk are openly plotting to kill our jobs, and are promising us a future utopia with “universal high income” at an undetermined later date. Inflation is higher for the bottom leg of the K too. Inflation hits lower earners harder for the simple fact that one divided by fifty is a higher percentage than one divided by fifty thousand, and while overall inflation has been coming down since its peak in 2022 coinciding with the low in the consumer confidence survey, specific goods that lower income people spend the majority of their money on have not dropped as far as topline inflation has. The latest inflation figures felt a bit soft and could be due to just wonkish changes in methodology, but rigging BLS numbers is very difficult and until there’s real evidence of it, no one should think that Trump’s tentacles have reached this far yet. Taking the latest inflation print at face value, the topline figure of 2.7% inflation is good. The Fed’s target of healthy inflation is 2%, so it stands to reason that things should feel like they’re stabilizing, right? Except that food away from home at restaurants is at 3.7% year-over-year inflation. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs are 4.7%, shelter is at 3%, medical care services is at 2.9%, used cars and trucks is at 3.6%, while energy, a big monthly percentage cost for middle class and lower income earners, is up 4.2%, with natural gas up a stunning 9.1%. Energy prices are rising for a lot of reasons, AI data center demand, tariffs, Trump destroying a revolution in clean energy and domestic manufacturing and restricting the supply we can deliver to our energy grid, and a lot of geopolitical stuff that would turn this into a 10,000-word blog, but the net result is that everyone’s paying a noticeably higher energy bill this winter than they were last winter. Trump points to the price of oil being low which is true, gasoline inflation is just 0.9%, but in a work-from-home world willing to buy Nazi cars if they’re electric, that matters less than how you power your home and business, which is not with gasoline. Ever since the pandemic, the stock market has shot off to all-time highs, taking the net worths of stock holders to all-time highs. Between their spending and seven companies creating a human centipede of centibillion-dollar AI investments, that is basically what is powering the bulk of the economy. That is why the vibes are shit. Because people go to the grocery store and can’t afford steak anymore and then are told that they’re just hallucinating their own economic misery as they scroll their phone and see Mark Zuckerberg shrugging his shoulders over potentially setting $500 billion on fire. Our modern Gilded Age has created siloed economic worlds whose lived experience is very different from each other depending on how much you make, how many assets you own and where you live. If it feels like different economic classes of Americans inhabit different economic realities, that’s because they do. But we do have to give the vibes caucus some credit here. It’s not called the vibecession for nothing, and we would be a lot better off if the explanations of the term’s inventor, Kyla Scanlon, were more central to the online discourse than the former political candidate whose opponents mailed his own posts to his constituents as an attack ad. This is nuanced stuff, and each side of the vibes vs. recession argument has a point, as Scanlon wrote in December 2023, “A slowdown in the rate of increase in price levels doesn’t really mean all that much when you’ve been living in an absolute price pressure cooker for three years.” Some prices are lower than they were in 2022, but higher than they were in 2019, and they’re not the only drastic shift the entire populace has experienced. Computer work for many above a certain income level has fundamentally changed, while those working in brick-and-mortar businesses and manufacturing cannot afford the same luxury. Many people are still dealing with the physical health and economic problems imposed upon society by a global pandemic that still has not ended, while social media is an even more ubiquitous force in our lives. We are just aware of more anecdotal stories of struggle now, which has made it more difficult to see the bigger economic picture amidst the worst inequality in a century. Add in the actual precarity around 42% of households feel per ALICE’s data, and this is a perfect cocktail for confusion. But the root of it is that the world changed and our expectations for it largely have not. The 2024 election was many things, but pressing a button to return to 2019 was absolutely behind a lot of people’s shockingly naive Trump votes. Something fundamentally broke in our society in 2020, a kind of trust that underwrites civil societies across time, and it manifests itself in every realm, especially economics where the split between the haves and have nots is most measurable. People feel bad about their situation relative to before the whole world changed seemingly overnight, and they are more aware of those who are benefiting from this period of collective misery. People know that The Great Gatsby is taking place every day in every major American city, and we can only hope that these people will not deliver us a future like The Grapes of Wrath. Anchoring is a very important financial concept. One of the things that surprised me in my finance classes was how central psychology was to many of them. The expectations that you set for yourself are of utmost importance because they serve as an anchor, and how you perceive everything else becomes relative to those expectations. In the wake of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, Americans experienced unprecedented levels of cheap credit that fueled a generation of affordable burrito taxis and other creature comforts of consumerism. When investors could weaponize Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) to load up on low-to-no-interest debt and then use that debt to invest in companies whose future cash flows became inflated thanks to ZIRP math, consumers had it easy as countless cans got kicked down the road. Tech giants arming themselves for their societal takeover in this era were and are able to carry immense debt levels because it cost them nothing to do so, and the simple change of a zero to a two, three, four or even nine back in 2022 has fundamentally altered the entire economy to a mathematical degree that many people just can’t understand, including the president, who is practically demanding that the next Fed governor bring ZIRP back as a requirement to get the job. Our expectations are still anchored to a world built by ZIRP. A world of easy money delivering us cheap burrito taxis and fueling the economy in the wake of a gargantuan economic collapse. A world where Elon Musk can become the richest man alive by creating the greatest meme stock in history, entirely fueled by the easiest money in a generation, enabling you to get rich off stupid speculative bullshit too. A world where Donald Trump could build a path to the presidency on cheap credit after going bankrupt six times. A world where cryptobillionaires buying their own libertarian islands is a real thing and not some modern James Bond plot. One of the many indignities of the K-shaped recovery out of 2020 is that we did get ZIRP again in that crisis, but it only benefited asset holders and created an excessive speculative mania, while it delivered consumers 9% inflation. The world of cheap burrito taxis is gone, and a lot of the deteriorating vibes are centered around the cost that higher interest rates and better wages for low wage workers have imposed on products that were cheap and accessible a decade ago. Trump is the avatar for the broad-based misunderstanding of this post-ZIRP era, where he is determined to make the same mistakes as the stagflationary 1970s in a desperate bid to make ZIRP great again and bring its creature comforts back. Perhaps it is because I graduated into the job market in 2009, a year where we began losing 800,000 jobs a month, and thus have a bias about 2008, but I think it is the central fault line in our present age. It is where both the capitalist backlash on the left and the reactionary fascism on the right have sprung from, and where fervent modern distrust of the establishment was born. The Iraq War was our generation’s Vietnam, but the widespread age of distrust began when a bunch of criminals defrauded the world and came within days of completely nuking the entire global economy. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is wrongly looked back at negatively for many reasons—a lot of leftists falsely attribute the bailout to Obama, but a simple recap of the nature of linear time will reveal this was a Bush bailout—and it is reviled by many for being a handout, but that is wrong too. We got paid back. The best critique of TARP was that it wasn’t big enough and Congress chickened out because they didn’t want to vote for something with a trillion-dollar price tag even though the scale of the crisis could only be measured in the trillions. A gigantic hole got blown in the economy by fraudulent financial schemes orchestrated by the uber-elite, upending millions if not billions of people’s lives for a generation. We know that those like me who graduated in its wake have had their professional prospects harmed relative to people who did not graduate into the genesis of ZIRP, while professions like lawyers and academics suffered, and the economy changed in a very fundamental way. The bitterness around TARP is that in 2008, Wall Street got bailed out but Main Street didn’t, which is a valid criticism, but Wall Street had to get bailed out. We had no choice; we’d be using bottle caps for currency right now if we hadn’t. But instead of fixing the fundamental economic problems in our age of inequality revealed by 2008, we just flooded the zone with cheap debt which jacked up asset prices and made inequality exponentially worse. What once was viewed as a policy only to be utilized in emergencies now became a decade-plus of a wildly distorted and anomalous status quo. We didn’t fix what 2008 broke, we just built a land of unsustainable burrito taxis and increasing financialization hacking the magic of zero percent interest rates. When 2020 rolled around and we were forced to enact emergency ZIRP measures again, this didn’t spawn another wave of affordable burrito taxis, but dog coins and inflation, proving the limits of this policy. I wrote last week about why gambling is everywhere, because the scam economy can be accessed by anyone now, and as dismaying as the rise of prediction markets and sports betting and crypto and zero date options trading and all other forms of high-risk gambling spreading to every nook and cranny of the world has been, it’s just following the broader trend in our hollowed-out and speculative economy. You don’t make it in a capitalist economy by selling your labor, that’s the sucker’s way out. You make it in a capitalist economy by buying assets, and that fact has become evident amidst 42% of households struggling to build wealth in the face of all-time high house prices and an all-time high stock market. I think consumer sentiment is near all-time lows because of a combination of real and widespread economic hardship, the drumbeat of the vibecession narrative on social media and major media reinforcing anecdotal evidence of real hardship, and the gobsmackingly shameless greed of the wealthy. It has all led many people to agree with George Carlin’s most famous line: it’s called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.

Title: The Great B2B Bifurcation of 2025: Why Some SaaS Stocks Are Up 142% While Others Are Down 51%
URL: https://www.saastr.com/the-performing-major-b2b-stocks-of-2025-what-the-ai-divide-tells-us-about-the-future-of-saas/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T15:06:14Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale The B2B markets bifurcated in 2025 — and the laggards all share one thing in common. Same macro environment. Same interest rates. Same customers. Completely different outcomes. What happened? And more importantly, what does it tell us about where B2B is headed? Let’s look at the data through mid-December 2025: HubSpot has fallen from ~$880 to ~$370 — a 51% decline that makes it the roughest performing major B2B SaaS stock of the year. The irony? The business is actually performing fine: So why the destruction? The market is pricing in maximum AI disruption risk for SMB-focused horizontal SaaS. HubSpot launched Breeze AI in September 2024, including customer agents, prospecting agents, and content agents. They’ve announced 200+ AI features. Their Breeze Customer Agent reportedly resolves 50%+ of support tickets. But here’s what the market is worried about: The Breeze platform is legitimately good. But the market isn’t convinced it changes the fundamental economics fast enough. This one is puzzling because Salesforce has actually shown real AI traction, and Q3 FY26 (reported December 3rd) showed growth reaccelerating: The Agentforce numbers are legitimately impressive: Marc Benioff has gone all-in on “Agentforce” as the company’s future. They acquired Informatica (closed November 2025), Regrello, and Waii to accelerate AI and data capabilities. So why is the stock still down 31%? The good news: Q3 may have been the turning point. Growth is reaccelerating, Agentforce adoption is inflecting, and the $60B revenue target by FY30 suddenly looks achievable. If Q4 delivers that 11-12% growth, 2026 could be a very different story for CRM. Adobe is down 35% despite legitimately impressive AI numbers: Adobe even admitted their own Firefly model wasn’t keeping pace with Google, OpenAI, and others — so they opened their platform to third-party models. That’s strategically smart. So why is the stock cratering? The market believes AI commoditizes creative tools. If Canva, Figma, and dozens of AI-native startups can generate images, videos, and designs at near-Adobe quality for a fraction of the price, Adobe’s moat erodes. Adobe’s defense is integration — Firefly embedded in Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and the entire Creative Cloud suite. But the market isn’t sure that’s enough when standalone AI tools are “good enough” for 80% of use cases. The other concern: AI is expensive. Adobe’s profits are up 9%, but the cost of running AI inference at scale will only grow. How long can they absorb those costs without raising prices? Bill.com (BILL) is down 43% YTD. Bill provides financial operations software (AP/AR automation) primarily to SMBs. The thesis was that SMBs would continue digitizing their back-office operations. The problem: AI makes this category look commoditizable. If AI agents can handle invoice processing, payment approvals, and vendor management, why do you need specialized Bill.com software? QuickBooks + AI agents might be “good enough.” Bill’s challenge is similar to HubSpot’s: their SMB customer base is the most vulnerable to AI-driven seat compression. The companies that need 3 people in the finance function today might need 1 person + AI tomorrow. Looking at HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, Bill, and Asana, clear patterns emerge: Every major loser serves broad horizontal use cases (CRM, marketing, creative, work management, finance). The winners (Veeva, Guidewire) serve specific verticals where domain expertise creates defensibility. Horizontal tools are easier to disrupt because the problem space is general. AI can attack general problems more easily than specialized ones. HubSpot and Bill.com serve primarily SMBs. SMBs have smaller teams, simpler processes, and less switching cost inertia. An AI-native competitor can win an SMB customer with a good demo. Enterprise deals require years of relationship building. SMBs are also more price-sensitive, so they’ll switch faster if AI enables cheaper alternatives. The entire SaaS industry was built on the assumption that more users = more value = more revenue. AI inverts this: more value often means fewer users. Companies that can pivot to consumption-based, outcome-based, or agent-based pricing will adapt. Companies stuck on seats will struggle. Every loser has shipped AI features. HubSpot has Breeze. Salesforce has Agentforce. Adobe has Firefly. But adding AI to existing products isn’t the same as building an AI-native business. The winners in 2025 — Palantir, the security companies — didn’t “add AI.” They are AI companies that solve specific, mission-critical problems. The data tells a clear story: If you’re building a B2B company in 2025, the market is sending a clear message: Horizontal tools are under pressure. Vertical solutions with deep domain expertise are defensible. Veeva for life sciences. Guidewire for insurance. Procore for construction. The best opportunities are in verticals that haven’t been AI-transformed yet. Don’t build a SaaS product and add AI. Build an AI-native product from day one. The architecture is different. The economics are different. The customer expectation is different. Seat-based pricing made sense when software helped humans do their jobs better. Consumption-based or outcome-based pricing makes sense when AI does the job instead. HubSpot is moving toward credits-based pricing for Breeze Customer Agent. Salesforce is experimenting with Agentforce pricing models. The transition is happening. The market is rewarding companies whose software customers literally cannot live without. Security. Data infrastructure. Compliance. Healthcare. Defense. “Nice to have” software is getting crushed. “Must have” software is thriving. SMB SaaS is harder in 2025. The customers are price-sensitive, AI-curious, and have low switching costs. Enterprise and government customers take longer to close but are stickier and less vulnerable to AI commoditization. One analyst note from Morningstar estimates: The median SaaS stock they cover is 30% undervalued. “That is pretty extreme.” If you believe: …then 2025’s losers might be 2026’s winners. Salesforce, HubSpot, and Adobe aren’t going away. These are great names with extremely strong logo retention. They have cash, distribution, and customer relationships. The question is whether they are adapting fast enough. They’re already adapting. 2025 exposed a brutal truth about B2B software: AI isn’t a feature, it’s a wedge. Companies that built AI-native, mission-critical, vertical products are winning. Companies that added AI to existing horizontal SaaS products are struggling. The market isn’t being irrational. It’s pricing in a future where: HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe — these are great companies with great products and great teams. They’re not going anywhere. But the market is telling them: “Show us the AI numbers. Show us the new business model. Show us that AI makes your customers pay more, not less.” Until they do, the stocks stay under pressure. The SaaS playbook that worked from 2010-2023 — land, expand, seats, seats, seats — is being rewritten. 2025 is the year we learned what the new playbook looks like. It’s easy to focus on the carnage. But the market cap winners of 2025 are equally instructive — and they share a playbook that every B2B founder should study. Palantir has been the undisputed winner of 2025, and it’s not close. The Numbers Are Absurd: What happened? Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) became the enterprise standard for deploying AI in mission-critical environments. Why Palantir Won: The Lesson: Palantir proves that AI-native architecture + mission-critical use cases + enterprise/government customers = market leadership. They didn’t add AI to existing products. They built an AI operating system from scratch. The valuation is insane (70x+ forward P/S). But the growth justifies the multiple — for now. CrowdStrike has quietly become one of the best-performing B2B stocks of 2025, up 51% YTD despite a major outage in July 2024 that rattled customers and investors. The Numbers: Why CrowdStrike Won: The Lesson: CrowdStrike proves that mission-critical + platform consolidation + non-discretionary spending = pricing power. Security is the one category where enterprises will pay more, not less, even in a tough macro. Snowflake had a rough 2024 but staged an impressive recovery in 2025 as the market recognized that data infrastructure is the foundation for enterprise AI. The Numbers: Why Snowflake Won: The Lesson: Snowflake proves that data infrastructure companies benefit from AI rather than being disrupted by it. AI needs data. Companies with the data win. Cloudflare has quietly become one of the biggest B2B winners of 2025, up 80%+ YTD. Why Cloudflare Won: The Lesson: Cloudflare proves that infrastructure positioning beats feature positioning. They’re not selling AI features — they’re selling the pipes that AI runs on. MongoDB had the most dramatic turnaround of 2025. Down mid-year, then two consecutive blowout quarters sent the stock soaring 70%+ YTD. The Numbers: Why MongoDB Won: The Lesson: MongoDB proves that data layer companies can be AI beneficiaries — if they position correctly. AI doesn’t threaten databases. AI creates more data that needs to be stored and queried. Shopify’s 51% YTD gain shows that not all horizontal SaaS is struggling. Why Shopify Won: The Lesson: Shopify proves that platform companies with true merchant-level embedding can still win — even in a tough SaaS environment. When you’re the operating system, not just a tool, you have pricing power. Perhaps the most instructive story of 2025 is Oracle — the 47-year-old database giant that somehow became an AI infrastructure play, hit an all-time high of $346 in September, and then crashed 45% to ~$188 by December. The Rollercoaster: Why Oracle Won (Until It Didn’t): Why Oracle Crashed: The Lesson: Oracle proves both that legacy doesn’t mean left behind AND that AI momentum can reverse fast. The 47-year-old company is still up 14% YTD and positioned in AI infrastructure — but the September euphoria was clearly overdone. Looking across Palantir, Cloudflare, MongoDB, Snowflake, CrowdStrike, and Shopify, clear patterns emerge: The winners either built AI-native products from scratch (Palantir) or positioned as essential AI infrastructure (MongoDB, Snowflake, Cloudflare). They didn’t just “add AI” to existing products. Every winner solves problems that enterprises literally cannot ignore: The winners serve enterprises and governments — not SMBs. Or like Shopify, they have such platform stickiness that SMB churn is still manageable. These customers have longer sales cycles but stickier relationships and less price sensitivity. CrowdStrike’s multi-module strategy, Palantir’s operating system approach, Snowflake’s data cloud — winners built platforms that expand within accounts, not point solutions that get replaced. The winners either already have consumption-based pricing (Snowflake) or are positioned to move there. They’re not dependent on seat counts that AI might compress. 2025 taught us that the SaaS playbook from 2010-2023 is being rewritten. The ones who took a market cap hit in 2025 — HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, Monday.com, Atlassian — are great companies that are adapting. Breeze, Agentforce, and Firefly are real products with real adoption. But the markets aren’t patient. Especially in the Age of AI. The market wants proof that AI makes customers pay more, not less.

Title: The Great B2B Bifurcation of 2025: Why Some SaaS Stocks Are Up 142% While Others Are Down 51%

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale The B2B markets bifurcated in 2025 — and the laggards all share one thing in common. Same macro environment. Same interest rates. Same customers. Completely different outcomes. What happened? And more importantly, what does it tell us about where B2B is headed? Let’s look at the data through mid-December 2025: HubSpot has fallen from ~$880 to ~$370 — a 51% decline that makes it the roughest performing major B2B SaaS stock of the year. The irony? The business is actually performing fine: So why the destruction? The market is pricing in maximum AI disruption risk for SMB-focused horizontal SaaS. HubSpot launched Breeze AI in September 2024, including customer agents, prospecting agents, and content agents. They’ve announced 200+ AI features. Their Breeze Customer Agent reportedly resolves 50%+ of support tickets. But here’s what the market is worried about: The Breeze platform is legitimately good. But the market isn’t convinced it changes the fundamental economics fast enough. This one is puzzling because Salesforce has actually shown real AI traction, and Q3 FY26 (reported December 3rd) showed growth reaccelerating: The Agentforce numbers are legitimately impressive: Marc Benioff has gone all-in on “Agentforce” as the company’s future. They acquired Informatica (closed November 2025), Regrello, and Waii to accelerate AI and data capabilities. So why is the stock still down 31%? The good news: Q3 may have been the turning point. Growth is reaccelerating, Agentforce adoption is inflecting, and the $60B revenue target by FY30 suddenly looks achievable. If Q4 delivers that 11-12% growth, 2026 could be a very different story for CRM. Adobe is down 35% despite legitimately impressive AI numbers: Adobe even admitted their own Firefly model wasn’t keeping pace with Google, OpenAI, and others — so they opened their platform to third-party models. That’s strategically smart. So why is the stock cratering? The market believes AI commoditizes creative tools. If Canva, Figma, and dozens of AI-native startups can generate images, videos, and designs at near-Adobe quality for a fraction of the price, Adobe’s moat erodes. Adobe’s defense is integration — Firefly embedded in Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and the entire Creative Cloud suite. But the market isn’t sure that’s enough when standalone AI tools are “good enough” for 80% of use cases. The other concern: AI is expensive. Adobe’s profits are up 9%, but the cost of running AI inference at scale will only grow. How long can they absorb those costs without raising prices? Bill.com (BILL) is down 43% YTD. Bill provides financial operations software (AP/AR automation) primarily to SMBs. The thesis was that SMBs would continue digitizing their back-office operations. The problem: AI makes this category look commoditizable. If AI agents can handle invoice processing, payment approvals, and vendor management, why do you need specialized Bill.com software? QuickBooks + AI agents might be “good enough.” Bill’s challenge is similar to HubSpot’s: their SMB customer base is the most vulnerable to AI-driven seat compression. The companies that need 3 people in the finance function today might need 1 person + AI tomorrow. Looking at HubSpot, Salesforce, Adobe, Bill, and Asana, clear patterns emerge: Every major loser serves broad horizontal use cases (CRM, marketing, creative, work management, finance). The winners (Veeva, Guidewire) serve specific verticals where domain expertise creates defensibility. Horizontal tools are easier to disrupt because the problem space is general. AI can attack general problems more easily than specialized ones. HubSpot and Bill.com serve primarily SMBs. SMBs have smaller teams, simpler processes, and less switching cost inertia. An AI-native competitor can win an SMB customer with a good demo. Enterprise deals require years of relationship building. SMBs are also more price-sensitive, so they’ll switch faster if AI enables cheaper alternatives. The entire SaaS industry was built on the assumption that more users = more value = more revenue. AI inverts this: more value often means fewer users. Companies that can pivot to consumption-based, outcome-based, or agent-based pricing will adapt. Companies stuck on seats will struggle. Every loser has shipped AI features. HubSpot has Breeze. Salesforce has Agentforce. Adobe has Firefly. But adding AI to existing products isn’t the same as building an AI-native business. The winners in 2025 — Palantir, the security companies — didn’t “add AI.” They are AI companies that solve specific, mission-critical problems. The data tells a clear story: If you’re building a B2B company in 2025, the market is sending a clear message: Horizontal tools are under pressure. Vertical solutions with deep domain expertise are defensible. Veeva for life sciences. Guidewire for insurance. Procore for construction. The best opportunities are in verticals that haven’t been AI-transformed yet. Don’t build a SaaS product and add AI. Build an AI-native product from day one. The architecture is different. The economics are different. The customer expectation is different. Seat-based pricing made sense when software helped humans do their jobs better. Consumption-based or outcome-based pricing makes sense when AI does the job instead. HubSpot is moving toward credits-based pricing for Breeze Customer Agent. Salesforce is experimenting with Agentforce pricing models. The transition is happening. The market is rewarding companies whose software customers literally cannot live without. Security. Data infrastructure. Compliance. Healthcare. Defense. “Nice to have” software is getting crushed. “Must have” software is thriving. SMB SaaS is harder in 2025. The customers are price-sensitive, AI-curious, and have low switching costs. Enterprise and government customers take longer to close but are stickier and less vulnerable to AI commoditization. One analyst note from Morningstar estimates: The median SaaS stock they cover is 30% undervalued. “That is pretty extreme.” If you believe: …then 2025’s losers might be 2026’s winners. Salesforce, HubSpot, and Adobe aren’t going away. These are great names with extremely strong logo retention. They have cash, distribution, and customer relationships.

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The true cost of fulfilling Trump’s mass deportation agenda and who’s profiting. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s first year back in office has been the brutality of his deportation machine and his administration’s numerous attempts to upend due process. Back in March, the Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador. Ábrego Garcia’s legal status protected him from deportation to his home country for fear of persecution. “I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process,” says Ábrego Garcia’s attorney Benjamin Osorio. “There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that.” This week on The Intercept Briefing, host Akela Lacy speaks to Osorio about Ábrego Garcia’s case. After months of being shipped around detention centers, he is free and fighting deportation orders from home with his family. “I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life.” says Osorio. “In the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice.” Ábrego Garcia’s story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda and for that reason his story has become a political flashpoint. But what’s less understood is the scale and scope of fulfilling the administration’s vision of mass deportation. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research called “Deportation, Inc.: The Rise of the Immigration Enforcement Economy,” maps out a vast web of companies that make up the rapidly growing deportation economy, how we got here, and the multibillion-dollar industry driven by profit, political power, and a perverse incentive structure. “The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern,” says Tyler McBrien, managing editor of Lawfare. “And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in.” Gauri Bahuguna, deputy director of research at SITU, adds, “It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is ‘How much money can you make per detained individual?’” “Even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group,” says Bahuguna. “There is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale.” McBride underscores that the current immigration system is “treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing, I’m Akela Lacy. The most defining feature of Donald Trump’s second term so far has been the brutality of his deportation machine, from masked agents tackling people in the streets to shipping people off to prisons in far-flung countries. The Trump administration wrongly deported Kilmar Ábrego Garcia to a notoriously violent prison in El Salvador back in March. But last week, a judge’s order finally freed him. Kilmar Ábrego Garcia: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: I stand here today with my head held up high. AL: That’s Ábrego Garcia speaking at a press conference after his release, joined by advocates and an interpreter at his side. KG: [Speaking in Spanish] Interpreter: Regardless of this administration, I believe this is a country of laws, and I believe this injustice will come to its end. AL: Ábrego Garcia is now back in Maryland with his family and is continuing to fight deportation orders. His story epitomizes the unlawfulness and cruelty of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda. Joining me now to update us on Ábrego Garcia’s case is one of his lawyers, Benjamin Osorio. Benjamin, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Benjamin Osorio: Thank you. AL: Kilmar Ábrego Garcia was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — custody last Thursday. To start, can you tell us how he’s doing since his release? Benjamin Osorio: He’s pretty tired. I don’t know if you saw when he went to go check in with ICE that morning, it looked like he hadn’t slept. I think he’s exhausted from the whole process. He’s bounced around from being deported in March to detained at CECOT — obviously, he’s much happier to be out of CECOT and back in the United States. But then, re-detained again, briefly out for a weekend, back in ICE detention, and then now out. He’s ecstatic to be with his family, but at the same time, I mean, he’s still limited in what he can do and obviously still facing federal charges. AL: During the press conference when he spoke after his release, during the segment where an advocate and a pastor are speaking, you can see him visibly getting emotional. It seemed like he was tearing up. Has this episode changed him? Benjamin Osorio: I didn’t know him before, so it’s hard to say whether it’s changed him, but again, somebody having been through what he has been through, I don’t know how it could not. At this point, if I was him, I would just want resolution to everything and not be in detention. AL: Back in March, Ábrego Garcia was detained by ICE in Baltimore, as you’ve mentioned, and then within a few days he was sent to CECOT, the notorious prison in El Salvador. What can you tell us about his experience in CECOT? Benjamin Osorio: Well, it’s been reported, so this isn’t anything confidential or of that nature. But he was taken off the plane and beaten — that’s sort of their welcome greeting — was beaten as he was taken off the plane. And then their heads were shaved. They were basically beaten on a daily basis, from what it sounds like. They were put on their knees for long periods of time, and if you passed out, you were beaten. They were not allowed to go to the bathroom — many of them urinating on themselves, defecating on themselves. He would talk about, in the middle of the night, you would hear people screaming out for help and nobody doing anything. The lights on 24/7 — blinding lights. Sleeping on all metal beds: no sheets, no pillows, no nothing like that. So it doesn’t sound like a pleasant experience. AL: How did that compare to his experience at the ICE detention facilities that he was shuffled around to? BO: He’s been segregated from everybody else, so not the same group housing that you would typically find in ICE. But being in solitary and only interacting with other individuals for certain hours of the day also has a detrimental effect on your morale and psyche. AL: Of course, yeah. BO: ICE conditions aren’t good, but again, better than CECOT. AL: Can you remind us, for people who might not know the full story, from the beginning of this ordeal, what happened to him? What was the process? Why was he moved to these different centers, and what happened there? BO: Since he’s been back in the United States, he was paroled back in when he was brought back in. He’s been shuffled back and forth between both immigration and criminal custody. So that’s been one of the reasons that he’s been moved back and forth. He was taken out to Tennessee, staying in a Putnam County Jail there, while they were arraigning him on the federal charges and then figuring out whether he was going to be released on bond. Once he was released on bond, he was then re-detained by Baltimore [Enforcement and Removal Operations] and then taken down to Farmville [in Virginia]. The judge in the federal district court case had ordered him to be kept within 200 miles, and then they transferred him from Farmville to Moshannon detention center [in Pennsyvlania]. And that’s where he was released from recently. AL: Can you talk a little bit about the legal strategy of these dueling, federal attacks against him — both on the immigration front and the criminal front — and how that complicated his situation? Benjamin Osorio: I guess, let’s talk about the three-front war, right? So he’s got an immigration case, which is pending before the immigration court. He then also has the habeas case, which — even though he’s out now — continues because of some of the things that have happened in the immigration case that’s taking place in the federal district court in Maryland. And then he’s got the criminal case taking place in federal district court in Tennessee. So he’s got a criminal defense team working on the criminal case. He also has us, who are partnered with Quinn Emanuel working on the district court litigation. And then he has us just working on the immigration court litigation. “Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now.” So it’s kind of messy, but what he was granted before is called withholding of removal. Typically before the Trump second administration, you were not seeing these third-country removals that you’re seeing now. So if you won withholding of removal, they can’t remove you to your home country, but they can remove you to a third country. So let’s say that he has this protection from El Salvador, they were not supposed to have been able to send him to El Salvador, but they could send him to Mexico, to Honduras, to Guatemala as part of these third-country agreements. They could do that. He would be a very visible candidate for them to try to go after to do that. We feel that we also were fighting the immigration case to try to normalize his status, get that back reopened, and adjust his status. Now when they paroled him back into the United States, they also created some new immigration options for him as well, potentially applying for asylum because he’s back within one year of having entered the United States, but also he’s married to a U.S. citizen. So now that he has a lawful entry back into the United States, he could potentially adjust status through her. So it’s messy. And obviously, the government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him. “The government has put the full force of DOJ and DHS behind it to try to make an example of him.” AL: You mentioned like his particular circumstances made him the perfect target for this administration and what they’re trying to do. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that and how his case became a flashpoint in this administration’s immigration policies. This was the case that finally pushed Democratic senators to say, “We’re going to go and visit these detainees,” people who have been removed. Why did that happen? BO: I think most Americans are intelligent enough to recognize that everybody deserves due process, right? There’s a reason that if somebody that we all know goes and commits a murder, they still get a trial. We don’t summarily execute them unless they’re a danger to the police officers arresting them or anything else like that. There’s a process. They get a jury of their peers. And the same thing in immigration: This guy had a lawful order protecting him from being removed from the United States, and the government violated that. And so the Constitution is designed to protect us from the government. And so here is the government violating somebody’s due process, violating the Constitution. And I think that’s why people cared about it. I don’t think it was necessarily about Kilmar, or his specific person — or it’s not about whether Kilmar is a good guy or a bad guy. It’s about, the government owes a responsibility to do the right thing, AL: The order to release Kilmar — a federal U.S. district judge in Maryland said that federal authorities lacked a legal basis for continuing to detain him. Has his case changed anything in your view, as far as how judges are handling other similar cases, or how the administration is approaching targeting people like Kilmar? BO: Yes. The federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed. But there’s been a change in bond rules too. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with this. In September, there was a case that came out from the Board of Immigration Appeals called Matter of Yajure Hurtado, and it basically tries to change the rules to make so many people ineligible for bond. Because they were trying to change the rules without actually going through Congress to change the law — which actually governs statutes and mandatory detention and who’s eligible for bond — we started filing a ton of habeases. And so I think the courts have probably never seen more immigration habeases in their life. “ I think the federal district courts probably are not fond of how many habeas we filed.” Like I said, they’re probably sick of it, but at the same time, they’ve been great and fast-acting on these habeas. Sometimes a habeas, a normal habeas, could pin for a while. But they’ve been great on ordering either the immigration courts to hold a bond hearing and find a head jurisdiction or beyond that ordering these people released. So in the habeas sense, I would think that Kilmar’s case has had a lot of effect in the immigration practice. AL: What’s next for Ábrego Garcia after his release? Obviously, you mentioned his pending cases. BO: It’s hard to say. We’re still in the middle of briefing both before the immigration side of things, both at the immigration court level because the immigration judge just issued a new order the other day, and then also before the Board of Immigration Appeals. And then because of some of the acts that the board and the IJ have taken — the immigration judge — have taken, now Judge [Paula] Xinis has ordered an additional briefing on the [Temporary Restraining Order] right now in federal district court. Look, I was shocked. People were asking us when we first started if we were going to be able to bring him back. And then I was kind of shocked that Xinis found that he didn’t have a removal order. It’s not something I would’ve predicted in the beginning. But then when there was that hearing a couple weeks ago, and she was talking about there not being a valid order because he was ordered removed to Guatemala. I mean there’s been a lot of different turns here. I think it’s hard to predict what ultimately happens. Like I said, if I’m him, I just want to be out and I want to be with my family, and if that means it’s in Costa Rica or whether that’s here in the United States as long as I’m not detained, I would be happy. AL: Any final thoughts? One thing I would ask maybe if you want to elaborate on is this idea that it doesn’t really matter what kind of person it is when we’re talking about these cases. Like, what matters is the statute and the constitutional protections that are here. And that’s completely at odds with how the administration has framed all of this — that the people it’s going after are criminals who deserve whatever’s coming to them. I think that’s an important distinction, but if there’s any other point that you touched on that you want to elaborate on? BO: I just think it’s funny. I hear different officials go on TV and they say, we’re going after the individuals who are breaking the law, or we’re going after the individuals here who are here unlawfully. But there have been many cases where they are making the people unlawful. So when they take away Temporary Protected Status from people from Haiti and Sudan and from Venezuela, these countries that have ongoing crisis in them, they made them undocumented. And when they say that we want people to do things the right way — look, Congress passed Section 208 [of the Immigration and Nationality Act] and made asylum a lawful pathway. Asylum is a lawful pathway to get status here in the United States. Now, if Congress wants to change the laws, that would be well within their right to do. But until they do that, their attempts to block asylum-seekers and their attempts through different regulatory changes or through the Board of Immigration appeals to whittle away asylum and go after victims of domestic violence — I don’t know, to me, that’s not the American way, and it’s sad that our government is targeting some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society. AL: What else is on your docket right now? BO: It’s pretty crazy, the number of detentions has obviously picked up pretty significantly, and that’s sort of my specialty, is detained removal. “Our immigration system is broken.” It’s just very sad because I see so many families — and families of people with U.S. citizen spouses and families of people with U.S. citizen kids — getting ripped apart. People always ask me, they say, “Why don’t people just do it the right way?” I have friends who are not immigration lawyers or, I’m from Georgia, I have a lot of friends who have maybe very different views on immigration than I have, and they’re like, “They’ve been here for 20 years. Why haven’t they fixed their status?” And I’m like, “Our immigration system is broken. I don’t think you understand like how complicated it is for somebody who’s been here 20 years.” Even if they have a U.S. citizen spouse, if they have more than two entries, they might be subject to a 212(a)(9)(C) and be subject to the “permanent bar.” That means they have to stay outside for 10 years — away from their U.S. citizen spouse, away from their U.S. citizen kids. “People don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans.” And then I have other things, where people are active members of this community. I have a family I represent that the U.S. citizen spouse works for a local school board, and they have two small U.S. citizen kids. And it’s sort of complicated, but at one hearing where the judge was ordering him removed, even though we won later on appeal and he’s still here — a 7-year-old girl’s coming up to me. And I have 6-year-old twins. So she’s about my kids’ age, and she’s asking me, “When is Dad going to come home?” And I’m like, “I don’t know. I don’t know.” And so I just think people don’t understand like how much damage we’re doing to future generations of Americans. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the economy. I don’t think people understand how much damage we’re doing to the American brand here. AL: Thank you so much for taking the time, Ben. We know you have a lot on your plate, so we really appreciate it. BO: Thank you. AL: After a quick break, we’re going to zoom out and talk about exactly who is profiting from the Trump’s deportation agenda, and take a closer look at what has become a rapidly expanding and lucrative industry. We’ll be right back. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Break AL: Welcome back to The Intercept Briefing. The militarization of U.S. borders and immigration policy is a project that’s been long in the making. Bill Clinton: We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law. George W. Bush: We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re going to make this country safer for all our citizens. Barack Obama: Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws. Unknown: President Obama has deported more undocumented workers than President Bush did. Donald Trump: And we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. AL: The violent immigration raids we see in communities across the country today could not have happened without the bipartisan efforts of past presidents — those who paved the way for an insatiable immigration bureaucracy and an unhinged administration ready to take it over. As of November, ICE is detaining more than 65,000 people, a historic high, according to The Guardian. Under the guise of protecting national security, officials have transformed U.S. immigration over the last two decades into a cash cow for private corporations. Today, Trump’s deportation machine takes up more than half of all federal law enforcement spending. And Trump’s marquee spending bill raises that to 80 percent. Democratic senators just released a report that found that the Trump administration diverted $2 billion in Pentagon funds to target immigrants, as our colleagues Nick Turse and Noah Hurowitz reported earlier this month. A new investigative video series from Lawfare and SITU Research maps out this vast web that comprises the deportation economy: how U.S. immigration enforcement has evolved into a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar industry shaped by private profit, political power and a perverse incentive structure. Joining me now to talk about this industry are some of the folks behind the project. Tyler McBrien is the managing editor of Lawfare, a nonprofit publication covering law, national security, and foreign policy. Tyler McBrien: Thanks for having me, Akela. AL: And we’re joined by Gauri Bahuguna, a computational designer and deputy director of research at SITU Research, a visual investigations practice in Brooklyn, New York. We’ve worked with SITU on reporting on reconstructions of police responses to protests, it’s great to have you on. Welcome, Gauri. Gauri Bahuguna: Thank you for having me. AL: To start, for both of you, what drove you all to do this project? What did you feel was missing from the public’s understanding of how the system works? GB: This project actually began as far back as 2023, and at the time we were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border. So at the time we were looking at the various, the physical, the digital, and the political infrastructures that create this everywhere border, so to speak. And from there, obviously, the election last year was a huge point for us to track and study. The industry part came up in our research of how and why this immigration enforcement seems to be a growing hot- button issue. “We were interested in expanding the notion of immigration enforcement beyond the border.” TM: What we are trying to do with this project is to make visible an entire system, as much as that’s possible. All the facets of the immigration enforcement economy — be it detention, deportation, surveillance, and interdiction — because I’m sure listeners can relate, the past year has just been this feeling of jumping from fire to fire. And you can easily miss the forest for the trees. We wanted to highlight not just these big-name companies that people will be familiar with — the Palantirs, the Googles, even maybe the GEO Groups, the private prisons — but also smaller companies that do food service or IT services that make up these web of contracts for ICE and DHS. AL: Tyler, that’s a good segue because we know that this is obviously a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s agenda, but there’s been a bipartisan effort to build up this machine since long before he first took office, which really accelerated when George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security and ICE after 9/11. But what other figures helped drive that expansion prior to Trump? How did we get to where we are today? TM: The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was a pivotal moment. It was a major restructuring of immigration, and that was also a point at which the framing of immigration went from more of a civil matter to more of a national security concern. And with that transition, the amount of money and contracts began to flood in because of this “higher echelon” issue of national security versus civil enforcement. 2002 was a pivotal moment, but like we said, it was building before that. We really try to convey that in the videos — of having not only Trump on the campaign trail promising the biggest deportation campaign in history, but also dating back to Bush, of course to Bill Clinton, and before. Just to also back up, the framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex, and throw out this provocation that we may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics. “The framing that we wanted to put forth was that of the military–industrial complex. … We may be seeing an immigration–industrial complex following the same dynamics.” AL: Gauri, can you talk about the main ways that this deportation economy operates? GB: It was in the Obama administration where the detention bed quota comes in, and that’s really the key unit of measurement that drives this particular part of the immigration enforcement industry, is “How much money can you make per detained individual?” And for now, even though the bed quota is gone formally from the law there, it still exists in contracts with companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group, where there is a minimum quota that ICE must fulfill in order to be in contract with these companies. And any detainees above that minimum guaranteed daily population, they get discounts on. So there is payment for detaining a certain number of people, whether or not the beds are occupied, and then the perverse incentive to keep those facilities filled because there’s an economies of scale. TM: This is another, I think, motivation behind the project is to highlight not only the ideological and political motives of the current immigration system — think Stephen Miller’s vision — but also the profit motive driving this perpetual system. And the upshot of it is something that Gauri just touched on, which is treating people as these products and units and to maximize profit there. AL: Can you talk more about this incentive structure and who is profiting? Like you mentioned, everyone knows Palantir, GEO Group, CoreCivic, and you mentioned there’s some other names that people may not be as familiar with playing a significant role there. But yeah, I’m curious to hear more about who is actually profiting. GB: The main profiteers are those large private prison corporations like CoreCivic and GEO Group, because ICE has different kinds of facilities that range from completely owned and operated by ICE to agreements with the marshals, and then completely contracted detention facility centers. And because of the pricing structure offered by these private companies, it is the lowest price per night per detainee in private detention centers. However, ICE will often work with local and state governments, who then subcontract out to these private companies to detain populations. So what happens is that almost or close to 90 percent of all of the detainee population are held in private prisons because it just makes that much more economic sense. TM: As Gauri said the biggest ones are the private prison contractors. I think the biggest single contractor is GEO Group, which listeners will probably be familiar, but they’re also smaller firms. In surveillance, we have the big names like Google, Palantir, Clearview, but there are also smaller companies, like BI2 Technologies. There are investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard. In the video, we have this map that shows just this web of companies. But I think what was really interesting in doing this project was to come to realize that this analogy between the military–industrial complex and the immigration–industrial complex was sometimes not so much an analogy as just the extension of one into the other. So some of these firms are the same. You have Northrop Grumman, where you have big weapons manufacturers. You have gun manufacturers that are also benefiting. AL: Because they’re arming the guards? TM: Exactly. And arming for some of the immigration raids, so for example, Operation Midway Blitz. AL: Does the incentive structure that you were talking about, Gauri, does that have the potential to limit future avenues for policy change on immigration? And is that already happening? Like the idea that the incentives are built around the fact that this economy already exists and it needs to continue existing or else it’ll be bad for the economy, and does that make it harder to unwind this machine? GB: That’s an interesting question. I think because these are being detailed in the contracts themselves, I would imagine, it is something that could be addressed and there could be safeguards against having these types of quotas. Because again, it is just another expression of the detention bed quota, and they did successfully get that repealed. AL: But the idea that like, even though they repealed that, it’s still part of this structure. Like, the economy is operating with a mind of its own, like outside of the policy sphere. TM: I think that’s the dynamic that we’re warning that is already happening and will continue to happen and further entrench. So if you think about detention, for example, which is the first chapter of the video that we put out. Often companies like GEO Group will have idle facilities that were just a red line on their balance sheet. And now there’s this huge incentive to get these idle facilities up and running — fill the beds. And then the way that it can become entrenched in that community, for example, is then that creates some jobs. And it’s this perverse choice between an economic boon to the local community in some small way versus not having those jobs. And so, you can see how these incentives — these just pure economic incentives — can just keep driving the machine as you said. AL: This is obviously very linked to the broader phenomenon of mass incarceration in the U.S. and the push and pull over cutting the number of people that we have behind bars outside of the immigration system. Did that come up at all in this project? Are there characters or actors who play a major role in building up the carceral system who also play a role in this system? We know private prisons, GEO Group and CoreCivic, are a big part of this, but obviously they don’t incarcerate the majority of people in the U.S. But I’m curious how this came up, if at all, during your research and how you think about the nexus between the U.S. prison system and immigration detention. GB: Yeah, absolutely. They’re so closely tied together because GEO Group, their facilities are both, again, they’re private prisons and also immigrant detention facilities. I believe some of the private prisons were then converted into detention centers. And now because there is this tipping point where there’s just so much more money in this immigration enforcement, you see other actors [are] moving toward that. “The myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research.” I also just wanted to note that the myth really that it creates jobs for local people was something that we found to be not necessarily true in our research. And one of our colleagues actually took a road trip through America and visited a lot of these towns that were in close proximity to these facilities. And because of the stop-and-start nature, so sometimes they would be filled, so the detention center was operational, so there were a few jobs given out. Then it would shut down, so they would all lose their jobs immediately. And more recently, with the immigration detention facilities, because of language requirements, they were not even hiring people from the neighboring towns. So it’s not even that there was a direct benefit to the community. AL: That’s really interesting. Did they interview people who lived in the town or where, who were they talking to? GB: Yes, pretty much people in the local watering hole. This is the facility that is also mentioned in the video in Michigan, one of the GEO Group idle facilities that was just recently opened, and I believe it’s the largest immigration detention center in the Midwest. So he was speaking to a lot of people in small towns around that detention center, and they all expressed similar sentiment. AL: I also just want to touch on this idea that ICE and CBP have really exponentially increased the amount of power and influence that they have over not just immigration policy, but our government in general. “ Two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point.” There’s been so much great reporting on just how much money has been diverted from other parts of the government, or how many agents have been diverted to these agencies to sort of power this machine. But I wonder, can you talk about that phenomenon? Like, these two small agencies that were intended for a very particular purpose have pretty much become the face of the government at this point. TM: Yeah, I guess I don’t want to overstate something that I said earlier about the profit motive and the economic factors driving all of this/ That’s a fear, and something that we’ve been seeing that is driving policy. But of course the political and the ideological motives are also driving this. You see this in the national security strategy that was just released by the administration — that border security and controlling immigration is the national security threat. So you see it elevated in the political arena as well. And then it’s not just the administration. You have Congress to thank for the exponentially higher billions that are flooding into DHS and ICE, who can then award the contracts to these companies. GB: It’s the result of decadeslong lobbying campaigns, right, to push for these harsh immigration laws. So I think there’s definitely the political angle, and also because of how CBP and ICE are allowed to operate, which is slightly different from other law enforcement agencies; they have a lot more leeway. Border Patrol, for example, they have a 100-mile radius within the U.S. border, that they can stop people without a warrant and just question them. I think these types of extra powers make it easier for the conversion or the misappropriation of a military force, so to speak. TM: And just to add one point to what Gauri said about lobbying. If you take GEO Group, for example, their PAC, according to FEC filings, was the first to max out donations to Trump’s 2024 campaign. AL: On this point about this being part of the national security strategy and this lobbying apparatus, this is also a strategy that Trump and his allies want to push beyond the U.S. and into Europe, for example. Can you talk a little bit about that, how the Trump administration is essentially lobbying to export this around the world, export this system around the world? TM: Yeah. I can speak to one aspect of this. Take the video that we put out on detention. We broke it down into three ways in which the detention economy works. One is permanent facilities. We talked a lot about private prisons. One is temporary or soft-sided facilities. But the third that we cover — as a sort of form of outsourcing or contracting — is “alternative jurisdictions,” as we call it. So think El Salvador, CECOT. Think the talk about detaining migrants at Guantánamo Bay. And then of course the system of deportation, these third-country removals, these are transactional often in nature, in terms of what a country would economically benefit very often from receiving migrants from the United States. We wanted to expand the idea of what a contract could be or what this transaction could look like beyond just the U.S. government and a private company in the US. It’s really more expansive than that. AL: Can you talk about how you compiled this project? I know a lot of the information was public or open source, but tell me about your approach. Where did you start? GB: So the first step was to identify who are the main actors within this economy. And that was identified through looking at the budgets and the contracts that you mentioned. This is open-source information. And then after that, we really wanted to understand further how this is exploding as a way. So I think looking for the details within the contracts that really jumped out, like the tiered pricing, for example. And then moving into now, how do you put this all together and visualize it? And I think that’s where we started being a bit more experimental with our research. And so one example is the parametric tool that we use to visualize deployed resources, which is one of the soft-sided detention facility contractors. So just trying to visualize what detention at this scale means because I don’t think that’s something that is particularly present in most of the conversations. So it was a combination of trying to find and really parse through these government contracts and all of this jargon. And then translate it into a way that was, again, paints this picture of it being beyond the border and located to other geographies within the United States. TM: On this parametric tool. I think Gauri and some of her colleagues at SITU really helped understand projections and what these big numbers and big promises would actually mean. “What do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean?” What that gets at is just the reason for contracting in the first place. The government just doesn’t have the capacity to find, detain, and deport the numbers of people that they are setting as a goal. And sometimes not even the single facility or single company that are contracted to do something can do it, which means that there likely will be more contracts and more money going into it. So I think that’s one thing that the SITU team really helped me visualize at least, was, what do these massive numbers mean and what will they continue to mean? AL: Tyler you brought up Stephen Miller earlier. Obviously we’re going to have to talk about him at some point. Top White House adviser Stephen Miller is widely recognized as the brains behind Trump’s deportation agenda. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent had this great piece about his vision earlier this week. He wrote, “Miller’s grander aims are best understood as an effort to destroy the entire architecture of immigration and humanitarian resettlement put in place in the post-World War II era.” I really encourage people to go read this because they interview Miller’s family members and go into like this book that his family member wrote about the immigration apparatus, like when they came to the U.S. Anyway, very interesting. But can you guys talk about Miller, his vision, and how that’s coming to life under Trump’s second term — and how that deviates or doesn’t deviate from lthe post-9/11 vision of this system? TM: I haven’t read the piece, and I can’t believe you’re asking me to crawl into Stephen Miller’s mind. [laughs] AL: Sorry, someone has to. [laughs] TM: I would go back to what I was saying in the past answer, where the way to achieve the scale at which Stephen Miller wants to deport and relocate people again is only achieved through a massive expansion of contracts. And that’s why the funding bill was so material to this. AL: You’re talking about the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” TM: Exactly, yeah. So I think Stephen Miller and even the Trump administration as a whole can announce that they want to hit these benchmarks, but it’s then these contractors who come in. GB: Yeah, I agree with what you said but also wanted to acknowledge the very prominent white nationalist undercurrent of his vision. AL: Yeah. GB: And I think that we can see that play out in how the language of how to describe migrants is very dehumanizing, “illegal aliens.” And it’s just rife with xenophobia in every news coverage. And I think that is moving the country toward a more, or less tolerant overall perspective of what migrants are and specifically which migrants are “good” and worthy of being in this country. And I think that is probably the most scary part of his vision coming to life. TM: Yeah, it’s a great point. We were constantly asking ourselves what part of this system we have today is continuity and what part is rupture. And I think to Gauri’s point, I mean that the rupture is just the destruction of any sort of refugee program, save for white Afrikaners from South Africa, is just a nakedly, racist policy. I think there’s just no other interpretation. AL: You’ve both mentioned this capacity issue — Miller and Trump have these quotas that incentivize these policies, but maybe don’t have the capacity to fulfill that vision, even though they’ve been very successful at it so far. But this brings up this notion that I heard a lot prior to Trump’s election. Policy people and reporters who cover immigration were saying, “Not that this is overblown, but take it with a grain of salt because there is no capacity to do what they’re saying that they want to do.” We’re obviously seeing that not really be borne out right now. But even if there isn’t capacity to achieve their goals, does it matter because of how much they’ve already been able to do? Obviously by diverting money, resources, and agents from all of these other departments, but despite all the handwringing over capacity, like this is still obviously happening in full force. GB: I don’t think it matters that much both for the base that they’re trying to appeal to and also the corporations and individuals involved in this large scale operation. What happens is that yes, it’s completely impossible for them to meet the targets they’re setting for themselves, but in doing so, they create like an urgency and that’s when more of these regulations start to dip and drop. [White House border czar] Tom Homan, for example, has already been calling to reduce the detention standards in ICE facilities, if it’s not permanent facilities, and we go into the tents. And then within the tents again, how much more can you pack in so you squeeze more profit, reduce the living conditions of these places, and then you have a lot more to show for that’s closer to this target, but whether or not they ever reach, it doesn’t matter to the people affected. AL: Right. I want to mention another piece that was recently published. Above the Law published this story about ICE, perhaps, inadvertently, posting a “watchlist” of immigration lawyers. We know the administration routinely attacks its perceived enemies, including immigration attorneys. What do you make of that and how the administration has gone after the legal system to power its agenda? TM: Yeah, I think it’s a clear attempt to reduce the friction that they face in the immigration system. And often that friction is happening in the courts. Some of the biggest administration immigration stories of the year have been about these high profile deportation cases. Kilmar Ábrego García, for example, Mahmoud Khalil, of course. You’re seeing the strategy deployed across other issue areas too. It’s the flip side of the capacity — they’re building out capacity while also trying to reduce the barriers, and most of the barriers are legal ones. AL: Right. GB: Even just in the geographic distribution, it’s again, trying to set up these obstacles for accessing legal counsel. So that’s very intentional, right? They’re extremely rural areas where most of these facilities are. It’s very difficult for people to be in touch with lawyers in facilities like Alligator Alcatraz; there was no access at all. So I think there is this both contempt and disregard for the law, but also intentional fear of limiting access. AL: Given where we are today and how big this deportation economy has grown and how deeply it’s spread its tentacles into all of these other sectors that we’ve touched on, is it possible to unwind this and what would that take? TM: It’s such a hard question. Like I said earlier, we throw out the analogy to Eisenhower’s military–industrial complex farewell speech. I think it’s safe to say that his warning went unheeded, and the military–industrial complex only increased exponentially. Which is one of the reasons we wanted to shift this new warning that, you know, maybe it will be heeded this time. But it is worrying to me because I think you contrast the current moment to the first administration, first Trump administration, where there were sometimes successful worker-organized protests, for example, especially at tech companies. After contracts with ICE were made public, workers came together to protest and sometimes those contracts were canceled. I feel like you’re not seeing the same dynamic here. There is, I guess, some power in the consumer base and if consumers are made aware of companies or investments that they are a part of that are also being used to detain and deport people often illegally, then perhaps there’s some sort of pressure point there. AL: And this reminds me, we didn’t even talk about this. The first anti-ICE protests that we saw under Trump [this term] brought the first National Guard deployment that we saw. And now I feel like people don’t even really — he’s deployed the National Guard to so many cities that people don’t necessarily connect that to that being an effort to tamp down on opposition to this deportation machine. GB: That actually connects quite well to what I’m about to say, which is I am a little skeptical about whether the toothpaste can be put back into the tube just because of how deep these roots have gotten into every part of our daily lives. And so the first pieces were about detention, and we’re going to do one on deportation and interdiction. Then the final one is a data surveillance piece. And I think that is really, that’s where so much money — like far beyond what the deportation and detention is estimated. I think this data surveillance piece is what will ultimately also impact citizens most directly, right? It’s being tested on migrants and then slowly, as you mentioned with the National Guard, it just creeps into daily life and becomes normalized. So I think just because of the, and we see that the large tech companies are also embedded into this administration, so I just feel like we’re moving towards a very dark point of no return. AL: Thank you for using the toothpaste and the tube analogy, because I think that is a perfect analogy for this. It’s not only impossible to do, but it’s very messy. Thank you both for joining me on the Intercept Briefing. This has been a great conversation on a depressing topic, so we really appreciate it. GB: Thank you. TM: Yeah, thanks so much for having us. AL: We’re going to add a link to the SITU and Lawfare series in our show notes and on our website. Really encourage you all to check it out. It’s fantastic work and more to come in 2026, so hopefully we will talk more about that then. That does it for this episode. Before we go, a quick note: We’re taking next week off.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world.

Title: Metaplanet to debut US trading with Deutsche Bank under MPJPY

Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:44:35Z

Metaplanet will debut US trading via American Depositary Receipts, aiming to broaden access for US investors without raising new capital. Metaplanet, a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, is set to begin trading in the United States on the OTC market via American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Trading in Metaplanet’s ADRs is expected to start on Friday, with its shares listed in US dollars on the over-the-counter (OTC) market under the ticker symbol MPJPY, according to an announcement. “This directly reflects feedback from US retail and institutional investors seeking easier access to our equity,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in an X post on Friday, adding that the launch marks another step to broader global access to the company. The launch comes months after Metaplanet established a US subsidiary in Miami with an initial capital of $15 million to grow Bitcoin (BTC) income. Metaplanet’s ADR program is launched through a sponsored level trust agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, acting as depositary, and MUFG Bank as custodian in Japan. American Depositary Receipts are financial instruments issued by US banks that represent shares of non-US companies, allowing US investors to buy and sell shares of foreign firms without the need to trade directly on foreign exchanges. “The ADRs are not intended to raise funds, but to fund the issuance of common shares and preferred shares by the company,” Metaplanet said. The ADR program differs from Metaplanet’s MTPLF offering, which began trading on the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX market in December 2024. “It [MTPLF] is not based on a sponsored ADR program,” the company noted in the announcement. The launch of Metaplanet’s MPJPY ADR program comes as the company’s Bitcoin buying has stalled. After acquiring around 29,000 Bitcoin in 2025, Metaplanet halted purchases in September, with its most recent acquisition dated Sept. 29, according to data from Bitbo. Since launching its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in April 2024, Metaplanet has accumulated a total of 30,823 BTC, emerging as one of the world’s largest digital asset treasuries alongside Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Metaplanet’s BTC buying halt came amid Metaplanet’s enterprise value falling below the value of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-October, raising concerns across the industry. Several digital asset treasury (DAT) companies also saw sharp share price declines following a strong rally in July 2025. Related: Strategy adds nearly $1B in Bitcoin as market slump pressures MSTR stock Metaplanet’s market to Bitcoin NAV (mNAV) — a ratio between the company’s value and its BTC holdings — has since recovered above 1, standing at 1.12 by publishing time, according to official data reported by the company.

Title: New H-1B visa rules upgrade some lottery applicants — and squeeze out others
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-lottery-new-rules-salary-big-tech-students-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-19T09:22:01Z
Full Content:
The H-1B visa has always created winners and losers. Every spring, the government runs a lottery for 85,000 new visas. Last fiscal year, nearly half a million people put their names in. This fall, the Trump administration set new rules in motion that immigration lawyers say will upgrade some foreign nationals in the lottery, while others will get squeezed out. The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing comments on the rule and preparing the final text. Three months after President Donald Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B workers, Business Insider has assessed what's changed, who is benefiting, and who is getting hurt. Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program includes a proposal that would tilt the lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants. Instead of giving every applicant a single, equal shot, the lottery would give workers in the top wage bracket four chances. Those in the lowest tier would continue to get just one. Suddenly, a machine-learning researcher promised a pro-athlete-sized paycheck looks like a slam dunk in the lottery compared to a junior developer at a midsize company. The Trump administration holds that employers have abused the H-1B as a way to hire IT talent cheaply. A September executive order announcing the new fee framed the issue as a raw deal for American workers, saying the program had been "deliberately exploited" to replace them with lower-paid foreign labor. The fee is now facing multiple legal challenges in federal courts. In a statement, Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Business Insider that the agency is working closely with the Department of Labor and the State Department to reform the H-1B program to "root out fraud." "The proposed rule will protect American workers, encourage employers to offer competitive wages, and ensure that H-1B visas go to top-tier talent filling critical, high-skill positions as the law intended," Tragesser said. Meanwhile, the State Department is tightening its screening of H-1B workers and their H-4 family members. The department directed consular officers to review applicants' social media and other public online activity as a standard part of the process — a shift that has led some consulates to cancel or reschedule visa appointments as they adjust to the new vetting rules. A State Department spokesperson framed the expanded screening as part of a broader push toward rigorous vetting over fast processing. The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis. Immigration lawyers say the proposed lottery updates hand an edge to large tech companies. The fee won't apply to most hires in Big Tech's pipeline, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin, Texas, attorney focused on employment and family immigration. It's much more common for those companies to poach visa holders already in the United States, or hire new grads straight out of American schools, whereas the fee only affects new petitions for workers living abroad. A National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data found that in fiscal year 2025, Amazon led all employers with 4,644 approved new H-1B petitions, followed by Meta, Microsoft, and Google. It was the first time these four tech giants occupied the top four spots. Large enterprises will treat the $100,000 H-1B fee as the price of getting the right people inside their organizations, said Edward Raleigh, a partner at Fragomen, one of the largest global immigration law firms. Justin Parsons, a partner at law firm BAL, which focuses on work immigration, is telling his tech clients that the fee could actually work in their favor. They can absorb a fee that startups and IT staffing firms cannot. In a lottery, when high-volume filers pull back, everyone else's odds improve, including those of cash-rich tech companies still submitting names. Plus, if the wage rule goes into effect, it would give Big Tech's big-ticket hires a better chance of success. The wage-based system would shift the odds even further toward large, often publicly traded companies that can afford to slot foreign hires into the top salary bands. Immigration lawyers say that would leave equity-heavy but cash-poor startups at a disadvantage in the lottery. "Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission," said Bay Area immigration lawyer Sophie Alcorn. Those same startups "may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system." One exception, said Alcorn, is the crop of well-funded artificial intelligence startups, where base pay for elite machine-learning researchers and engineers is already sky-high. Under the new system, international students would also have fewer shots on goal. New grads typically start in lower-wage tiers, which would give them fewer tickets in the lottery, just as small and midsize companies are backing away from sponsoring them at all. Alcorn, who serves mostly entrepreneurs and early-stage tech companies, said a handful of jobseekers, including international students, have told her that companies have pulled offers to those requiring visa sponsorship — spooked by headlines and shifting rules. On paper, most foreign students who are already in the United States shouldn't be hit with the $100,000 fee, Finkelman said. If they're on F-1 student visas and move onto H-1Bs, that's a change of status, not a brand-new petition, so the fee wouldn't apply, he said. The Trump administration has framed these updates as a win for American workers. Software engineers, in particular, have something to gain if the changes achieve their stated intent. The tech industry has shed tens of thousands of staff this year, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all cutting engineering-heavy roles as they restructure around automation. At the same time, early-stage startups are boasting that machines now do a huge share of the coding. Immigration lawyers are suggesting that some companies will pull back from hiring foreign talent under these new rules. The Trump administration is banking on some of those jobs now defaulting to American-born workers and green-card holders by the process of least resistance. Domestic coders are contending with both layoffs and LLMs. But in this new hierarchy of risk, the American engineer could become a safer, cheaper bet than a foreign hire whose visa now comes with more cost, paperwork, and regulatory headaches. "One of the main attributes of this administration is that it keeps people guessing," said Ted Chiappari, head of the immigration group at law firm Duane Morris. "Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back on Wednesday." Correction: December 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the number of H-1B visas approved annually. The cap is 85,000 visas. Jump to

Title: How Amazon's 8.5% layoff in Luxembourg raises difficult questions for Indian foreign workers

Time Published: 2025-12-19T02:35:18Z

When Amazon announced 14,000 cuts globally earlier this week, a number of these were from its tech unit in Luxembourg. Bloomberg reported that the retail giant is culling 8.5% or 370 of its 4,370 employees in the tiny European nation, its largest such job cuts here in around 20 years. The Amazon layoffs could also pose an impossible situation for Indian and other foreign workers in Luxembourg, who are likely to be among those affected. The redundancies are “adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies,” Amazon said in a memo to staff on 12 December, adding that the severance package “goes well beyond industry benchmarks”. The Luxembourg Labor Minister’s office didn’t return a request for comment on the layoffs. The Duchy of Luxembourg has employees from the United States, Australia, Egypt, India, and Tunisia working at Amazon. If any of these staff are among those fired, they will have to find another job within three months or return home. Speaking to Bloomberg, Prash Chandrasekhar, a member of the Amazon employee delegation, said some employees may have to leave the country. “I am almost sure some employees will have to leave. It’s not easy to find a job in Luxembourg, for 370 people entering the job market at the same time,” he said. Chandrasekhar added that for those seeking work in big tech in particular, there is no real alternative to Amazon. Notably, to fire employees in the European Union (EU), companies must hold negotiations with employee representatives and sometimes the government. After two weeks of such discussions, Amazon reduced its job cuts in Luxembourg from 470 to 370, Bloomberg added. Amazon will notify a number of the affected employees of their termination in February, Chandrasekhar said. The report added that Amazon's layoffs in the 680,000-population country could trigger some “speed bumps” in the so far mutually beneficial relationship between the tech giant and tax haven nation. Luxembourg is known as a tax haven and financial centre with relatively high wages and low-income taxes, which have benefited many foreign companies. Amazon has since 2003 steadily expanded in the country and even after the layoffs will be Luxembourg’s fifth-largest employer. An employee told Bloomberg anonymously that most of the cuts are expected to be among software developers as artificial intelligence (AI) use grows, and to “trim” the workforce hired during the pandemic-era boom. The General Luxembourg Workers’ Organization (OGBL) union and other unions allege that Amazon has been granted “outsized” tax benefits in Luxembourg. The BB report said that Amazon and other foreign companies have set up holding companies in Luxembourg, through which they funnel European operations. It added that Amazon uses accounting rules deemed legal by European courts in 2023 to routinely declare losses on its continental operations and minimise tax burden. Last year, according to public records, the Luxembourg-based holding company Amazon EU Sarl reported €70.4 billion ($82.8 billion) in EU e-commerce sales and almost the same amount of expenses, including employee costs, leaving the company with a tax on profit of just €180 million. In November, Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden met Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in Seattle, and later stressed in a LinkedIn post that the company remains a “vital partner” for Luxembourg. In a comment under the post, Jassy replied, “Luxembourg’s been an important home for Amazon and our 4,000 teammates there. Appreciated the discussion and partnership.” (With inputs from Bloomberg) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Yet retail investors on Reddit and X remain deeply skeptical. Social sentiment data shows bearish scores of 18 to 35 out of 100 over the past 30 days, with most activity on r/wallstreetbets. While the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 167 percentage points and the Nasdaq 100 by 169 percentage points in 2025, retail traders are betting against further gains. One bullish voice on r/wallstreetbets wrote: “data center stocks are taking a beating and they feel grossly undervalued at the moment” and explained that “NBIS market cap is now barely larger than their Microsoft + Meta deals.” The post attracted just 55 upvotes, showing even bullish arguments aren’t resonating. The fundamental concerns driving bearish sentiment: These metrics explain the bearish sentiment. The valuation appears disconnected from fundamentals, even as analysts maintain unanimous buy ratings and a $151.50 price target implying 94% upside. Nebius has crushed broader market returns in 2025, yet fell 17.17% in the past week. Institutional investors own 48.42% of shares, suggesting professional money managers see value retail traders don’t. The company secured major AI infrastructure contracts with Microsoft and Meta worth billions, but these deals haven’t translated into profitability. With $4.79 billion in cash against $4.51 billion in debt, Nebius has the balance sheet to fund expansion. Still, negative operating cash flow of $80.6 million in Q3 raises questions about sustainability while scaling infrastructure. The key question is whether retail skepticism proves prescient or the 188% rally has further to run. The handful of retail traders buying calls earlier this year were betting on the latter, but remain a tiny minority in a sea of bearish sentiment. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Search In January 2024 I wrote about the insanity of the Magnificent Seven dominating the MSCI World Index, and I wondered how long the number can continue to go up? It has continued to surge upward at an accelerating pace, which makes me worry that a crash is likely closer. As a software professional, I decided to analyze whether using stop-loss orders could reliably automate avoiding deep drawdowns. As everyone with some savings in the stock market (hopefully) knows, the stock market eventually experiences crashes. It is just a matter of when and how deep the crash will be. Staying on the sidelines for years is not a good investment strategy, as inflation will erode the value of your savings. Assuming the current true inflation rate is around 7%, a restaurant dinner that costs 20 euros today will cost 24.50 euros in three years. Savings of 1000 euros today would drop in purchasing power from 50 dinners to only 40 dinners in three years. Hence, if you intend to retain the value of your hard-earned savings, they need to be invested in something that grows in value. Most people try to beat inflation by buying shares in stable companies, directly or via broad market ETFs. These historically grow faster than inflation during normal years, but likely drop in value during recessions. What if you could buy stocks to benefit from their value increasing without having to worry about a potential crash? All modern online stock brokers have a feature called stop-loss, where you can enter a price at which your stocks automatically get sold if they drop down to that price. A trailing stop-loss order is similar, but instead of a fixed price, you enter a margin (e.g. 10%). If the stock price rises, the stop-loss price will trail upwards by that margin. For example, if you buy a share at 100 euros and it has risen to 110 euros, you can set a 10% trailing stop-loss order which automatically sells it if the price drops 10% from the peak of 110 euros, at 99 euros. Thus, no matter what happens, you only lost 1 euro. And if the stock price continues to rise to 150 euros, the trailing stop-loss would automatically readjust to 150 euros minus 10%, which is 135 euros (150-15=135). If the price dropped to 135 euros, you would lock in a gain of 35 euros, which is not the peak price of 150 euros, but still better than whatever the price fell down to as a result of a large crash. In the simple case above, it obviously makes sense in theory, but it might not make sense in practice. Prices constantly oscillate, so you don’t want a margin that is too small, otherwise you exit too early. Conversely, having a large margin may result in too large a drawdown before exiting. If markets crash rapidly, it might be that nobody buys your stocks at the stop-loss price, and shares have to be sold at an even lower price. Also, what will you do once the position is sold? The reason you invested in the stock market was to avoid holding cash, so would you buy the same stock back when the crash bottoms? But how will you know when the bottom has been reached? I am not a professional investor, and nobody should take investment advice from me. However, I know what backtesting is and how to leverage open source software. So, I wrote a Python script to test if the trading strategy of using trailing stop-loss orders with specific margin values would have worked for a particular stock. First you need to have data. YFinance is a handy Python library that can be used to download the historic price data for any stock ticker on Yahoo.com. Then you need to manipulate the data. Pandas is the Python data analysis library with advanced data structures for working with relational or labeled data. Finally, to visualize the results, I used Lightweight Charts, which is a fast, interactive library for rendering financial charts, allowing you to plot the stock price, the trailing stop-loss line, and the points where trades would have occurred. I really like how the zoom is implemented in Lightweight Charts, which makes drilling into the data points feel effortless. The full solution is not polished enough to be published for others to use, but you can piece together your own by reusing some of the key snippets. To avoid re-downloading the same data repeatedly, I implemented a small caching wrapper that saves the data locally (as Parquet files): The dataframe is a Pandas object with a powerful API. For example, to print a snippet from the beginning and the end of the dataframe to see what the data looks like, you can use: Example output: Adding new columns to the dataframe is easy. For example, I used a custom function to calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI). To add a new column “RSI” with a value for every row based on the price from that row, only one line of code is needed, without custom loops: After manipulating the data, the series can be converted into an array structure and printed as JSON into a placeholder in an HTML template: In the HTML template, the marker {{ variable }} in Jinja syntax gets replaced with the actual JSON: There are also Python libraries built specifically for backtesting investment strategies, such as Backtrader and Zipline, but they do not seem to be actively maintained, and probably have too many features and complexity compared to what I needed for doing this simple test. The screenshot below shows an example of backtesting a strategy on the Waste Management Inc stock from January 2015 to December 2025. The baseline “Buy and hold” scenario is shown as the blue line and it fully tracks the stock price, while the orange line shows how the strategy would have performed, with markers for the sells and buys along the way. I experimented with multiple strategies and tested them with various parameters, but I don’t think I found a strategy that was consistently and clearly better than just buy-and-hold. It basically boils down to the fact that I was not able to find any way to calculate when the crash has bottomed based on historical data. You can only know in hindsight that the price has stopped dropping and is on a steady path to recovery, but at that point it is already too late to buy in. In my testing, most strategies underperformed buy-and-hold because they sold when the crash started, but bought back after it recovered at a slightly higher price. In particular when using narrow margins and selling on a 3-6% drawdown the strategy performed very badly, as those small dips tend to recover in a few days. Essentially, the strategy was repeating the pattern of selling 100 stocks at a 6% discount, then being able to buy back only 94 shares the next day, then again selling 94 shares at a 6% discount, and only being able to buy back maybe 90 shares after recovery, and so forth, never catching up to the buy-and-hold. The strategy worked better in large market crashes as they tended to last longer, and there were higher chances of buying back the shares while the price was still low. For example, in the 2020 crash selling at a 20% drawdown was a good strategy, as the stock I tested dropped nearly 50% and remained low for several weeks; thus, the strategy bought back the stocks while the price was still low and had not yet started to climb significantly. But that was just a lucky incident, as the delta between the trailing stop-loss margin of 20% and total crash of 50% was large enough. If the crash had been only 25%, the strategy would have missed the rebound and ended up buying back the stocks at a slightly higher price. Also, note that the simulation assumes that the trade itself is too small to affect the price formation. We should keep in mind that in reality, if many people have stop-loss orders in place, a large price drop would trigger all of them, creating a flood of sell orders, which in turn would affect the price and drive it lower even faster and deeper. Luckily, it seems that stop-loss orders are generally not a good strategy, and we don’t need to fear that too many people will be using them. Even though using a trailing stop-loss strategy does not seem to help in getting consistently higher returns based on my backtesting, I would still say it is useful in protecting from the downside of stock investing. It can act as a kind of “insurance policy” to considerably decrease the chances of losing big while increasing the chances of losing a little bit. If you are risk-averse, which I think I probably am, this tradeoff can make sense. I’d rather miss out on an initial 50% loss and an overall 3% gain on recovery than have to sit through weeks or months with a 50% loss before the price recovers to prior levels. Most notably, the trailing stop-loss strategy works best if used only once. If it is repeated multiple times, the small losses in gains will compound into big losses overall. Thus, I think I might actually put this automation in place at least on the stocks in my portfolio that have had the highest gains. If they keep going up, I will ride along, but once the crash happens, I will be out of those particular stocks permanently. Do you have a favorite open source investment tool or are you aware of any strategy that actually works? Comment below!
